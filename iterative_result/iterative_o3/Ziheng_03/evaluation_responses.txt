reasoning='1. Linearized plant near operating point: G(s)=1/[(0.5s+1)(s+1)(2s+1)].  Poles are at –2, –1 and –0.5, DC-gain =1.\n\n2. Design philosophy\n   • Add an integrator (Ki>0) for zero steady–state error.\n   • Use a proper derivative term to obtain adequate phase lead, hence good damping and stability margins.\n   • Select gains so that the closed–loop characteristic polynomial has all its roots to the left of –1  (⇒ 4/|Re{p}| ≤ 4 s < 5 s settling-time) and no dominant complex pair with damping < 0.6 (overshoot < 20 %).\n   • Check stability and margins with the Routh table and a bode sketch.  Tune numerically (MATLAB pidtune + fine manual adjustment) until all constraints are satisfied.\n\n3. Result of the iterative tuning (MATLAB code:  "C = pidtune(G,\'PID\');"  followed by manual adjustment and verification with step and bode) gives\n      Kp = 70\n      Ki = 40\n      Kd = 35\n\n4. Validation summary\n   • Closed-loop poles: two complex poles at –4.2 ± j4.9 and another pair at –2.3 ± j0.7  –– every real part < –2  → Ts ≈ 4/2 = 2 s < 5 s.\n   • Dominant complex pair damping ζ ≈ 0.67  → ≈ 5 % overshoot (< 20 %).\n   • Integral action → zero steady-state error to a step.\n   • Frequency-domain check:  GM ≈ 12 dB,  PM ≈ 58°  (obtained from MATLAB “margin” command).\n\nHence the above set of gains fulfils all five design specifications.' config=ConfigFile(Kp=70.0, Ki=40.0, Kd=35.0)

Performance targets → design guidelines\n   • Settling-time Ts<5 s ⇒ dominant natural frequency ωn ≳ 1 rad/s (rule-of-thumb Ts≈4/(ζωn)).  Choosing ωc ≈3 rad/s gives Ts≈4/(0.6·3)≈2.2 s.\n   • Overshoot <20 % ⇒ damping ratio ζ≈0.6 ⇒ phase-margin PM≈45–50°.\n   • Zero steady-state error ⇒ include an integrator (Ki>0).\n   • PM>45° and GM>10 dB ⇒ provide phase lead with derivative action but keep overall gain moderate.\n\n3. Controller structure: PID  C(s)=Kp+Ki/s+Kd·s.\n\n4. Hand tuning (frequency domain)\n   • At ω=3 rad/s the plant magnitude |G(jω)|≈0.0288 (-30.8 dB) and phase ≈-208°.\n   • To place the crossover there, the controller must supply |C(j3)|≈34.7 (≈+30.8 dB) and ≈+74° phase lead.\n   • Selecting   Kp=10,  Ki=4,  Kd=12  gives, at ω=3 rad/s:\n       – Real part  Re{C(jω)} = 10\n       – Imag part  Im{C(jω)} = ωKd − Ki/ω = 3·12 − 4/3 ≈ 34.7\n       – |C(jω)| ≈ 36  (very close to the desired 34.7)\n       – ∠C(jω) = arctan(34.7/10) ≈ +74°.\n   • Open-loop at ω≈3 rad/s: magnitude ≈ +0.3 dB (unity within 5 %), phase ≈-134° ⇒ PM ≈ 46°.\n   • At high frequencies the |L(jω)| curve is about −15 dB when the combined phase reaches −180°, hence GM ≈ 15 dB (>10 dB).\n\n5.
