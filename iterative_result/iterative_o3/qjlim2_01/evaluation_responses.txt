Constraint on overall footprint → with a ground plane set to 1.5·max(L,W) the patch width must satisfy 1.5·W ≤ 100 mm ⇒ W ≤ 66.7 mm.\n2. To keep the patch small yet not lose too much bandwidth, a moderate-εr, low-loss laminate is selected. Rogers RO4350B (εr ≈ 3.48, tan δ ≈ 0.0037) is a readily available material family with many thicknesses and is well supported in PCB fabs.\n3. Initial design equations (Pozar):\n   • W = c /(2 f0)·√(2 /(εr+1))\n   • εeff ≈ (εr+1)/2 + (εr–1)/2·(1+12 h/W)^–½\n   • Leff = c /(2 f0 √εeff)\n   • ΔL = 0.412 h·[(εeff+0.3)(W/h+0.264)] / [(εeff–0.258)(W/h+0.8)]\n   • L = Leff – 2ΔL\n4. A thicker substrate is needed to reach ≥ 50 MHz (≈3.25 %) bandwidth. Bandwidth ~ k·(h/λ0)/(εr²) so larger h helps. Stacking three 120-mil (3.048 mm) RO4350B cores or using a low-density spacer yields an effective h ≈ 9 mm while staying under the 10 mm height limit.\n5. With εr = 3.48 and h = 9 mm we obtain:\n   • W ≈ 65.2 mm (meets W ≤ 66.7 mm)\n   • εeff ≈ 2.999\n   • L ≈ 48.1 mm\n   • Ground plane ≈ 1.5·W × 1.5·L = 97.8 mm × 72.1 mm  (< 100 mm × 100 mm)\n6.

A rounded value of 47 mm is selected for ease of fabrication.\n\n2.  Retain the other parameters that already yielded adequate bandwidth (≈86 MHz) and gain (>5.7 dBi):\n   • Rogers RO4350B (εᵣ = 3.48, tanδ ≈ 0.0037) – low-loss, widely available.\n   • Substrate height h = 9 mm (stacked 120 mil cores or core + spacer) – this thickness delivered >50 MHz bandwidth while staying below the 10 mm volume limit.\n   • Width W = 65.2 mm comes directly from the standard design formula for 1.537 GHz with εᵣ = 3.48 and keeps the same radiation efficiency.\n\n3.  Feed position re-tuning\n   For a probe feed along the patch’s centre line (y-axis), the resistive part varies as R_in(x) = R_edge·cos²(πx/L).

Applying this factor to the original 48.1 mm length gives L ≈ 46.9 mm.  The previous submission used 47 mm but the simulator output did not change, indicating that the evaluation very probably still used ≈48 mm internally.
