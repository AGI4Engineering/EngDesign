Thus the one-way power gain varies like cos² θ and the two-way gain (Tx×Rx) varies like cos⁴ θ.  To obtain the scan-sector loss we average the inverse of this factor over the entire sector (−θ₀ … +θ₀, θ₀ = 60° = π/3 rad):\n    L_scan (linear) = ⟨sec⁴ θ⟩ = (1/θ₀) ∫₀^{θ₀} sec⁴ θ dθ\n                     = (1/θ₀) [tan θ + tan³ θ /3]₀^{θ₀}\n                     = (tan θ₀ + tan³ θ₀ /3) / θ₀\nWith tan 60° = √3 ≃ 1.7320508 and θ₀ = 1.0471976 rad this gives\n    L_scan (linear) = 3.3070\n    L_scan (dB)    = 10 log₁₀(3.3070) = 5.1909 dB.\nThe scan-sector loss to be added to the detectability factor is therefore 5.1909 dB (rounded to four decimals).\n\nTask 11 – MTI losses (2-pulse canceller, N = 10 pulses)\nNoise-correlation loss L_mti_a: the output noise samples of a 2-pulse canceller are correlated.
