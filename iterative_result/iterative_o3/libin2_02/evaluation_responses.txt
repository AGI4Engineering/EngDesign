reasoning='Goal: find a single Round-Robin quantum (q) so that for each of the three given workloads  \ncombined_cost = avg_waiting_time + context_switches + q*0.5  \ndoes not exceed the required limits (17, 17, 8 ms).\n\nSearch strategy\n1. Try a few candidate quanta and simulate the RR schedule for every case.\n2. For every simulation record\n   • completion time of every thread → waiting time = completion − arrival − burst\n   • number of context switches (every time the CPU starts executing a different thread)\n   • quantum_cost = q×0.5\n   • combined_cost = avg_waiting_time + context_switches + quantum_cost\n3. Keep the first quantum that satisfies all three limits.\n\nDetailed calculations for q = 5 ms (the chosen quantum)\n-------------------------------------------------------\nCASE 1  (0,5)(2,3)(4,8)(6,6)(8,4)\nGantt: P1|P2|P3|P4|P5|P3|P4  (6 switches)\nWaiting times: P1 0, P2 3, P3 13, P4 14, P5 10  → avg = 8.0 ms\ncombined_cost = 8.0 + 6 + 2.5 = 16.5 ms  (≤17)\n\nCASE 2  (0,10)(1,2)(3,7)(5,5)\nGantt: P1|P2|P3|P4|P1|P3  (5 switches)\nWaiting times: P1 12, P2 4, P3 14, P4 7  → avg = 9.25 ms\ncombined_cost = 9.25 + 5 + 2.5 = 16.75 ms (≤17)\n\nCASE 3  six 2-ms threads arriving every 2 ms\nEach job finishes in one slice; 5 switches, avg_wait = 0 ms\ncombined_cost = 0 + 5 + 2.5 = 7.5 ms (≤8)\n\nThus q = 5 ms is acceptable for all workloads.' config=ConfigFile(time_quantum=5, case1=CaseMetrics(avg_waiting_time=8.0, context_switches=6, quantum_cost=2.5), case2=CaseMetrics(avg_waiting_time=9.25, context_switches=5, quantum_cost=2.5), case3=CaseMetrics(avg_waiting_time=0.0, context_switches=5, quantum_cost=2.5))
