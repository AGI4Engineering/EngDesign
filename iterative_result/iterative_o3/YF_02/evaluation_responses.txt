reasoning="Goal: choose beam thickness Th so that maximum vertical deflection uy ≤ 1 mm under two 1000 N loads at L/4 and 3L/4 on a simply-supported steel beam (E = 210 000 MPa, ν = 0.3). 1)  Model beam with Euler-Bernoulli theory to get first-cut stiffness estimate. 2)  For a symmetrically loaded simply-supported beam the bending moment between the loads is constant: M = P·a with a = L/4.  Reactions are R = P.  Integrating EI y'' = M(x) piece-wise from x = 0 to L/2 gives centre deflection\n      δ = 63 155 / h³   (mm)\n      where h = Th (mm), P = 1000 N, L = 1000 mm, a = 250 mm, w = 40 mm and I = w h³ /12.\n3)  Set δ ≤ 1 mm → h³ ≥ 63 155 → h ≥ 40 mm.  4)  To score well we want δ /1 mm between 0.70 and 0.90.  Evaluate:\n      Th = 42 mm → δ ≈ 0.85 mm (ratio 0.85).\n      Th = 43 mm → δ ≈ 0.79 mm (ratio 0.79).\n      Th = 44 mm → δ ≈ 0.74 mm (ratio 0.74).\n5)  Shear deflection contribution is tiny (≈0.002 mm for Th = 43 mm) so bending estimate is adequate. 6)  Picking Th = 43 mm gives a predicted deflection ≈0.8 mm – comfortably below 1 mm while remaining close to the 0.7-0.9 optimum band even if the detailed 3-D FEM returns a slightly larger displacement.  Hence it is a structurally efficient and safe choice." config=ConfigFile(Th=43.0)
