Attempt 1:
reasoning='By analyzing the connections in the supplied figure and recalling the standard "Balance Battery Cells with Switched-Capacitor Method" Simulink example, every missing block (A–J, except H) can be inferred from signal-flow context:\n\n• The ZOH output containing the three SOC signals must be reduced to a single value to decide the global operating mode, so A is a max block.\n• The relay’s boolean output that selects charge vs. discharge is therefore the “charge-enable” logical line fed into the Battery CC-CV block – that is B (chargingenabled).\n• The constant reference (4.1 V CV target) is what enters the Battery CC-CV’s second control port, so C is a constant block.\n• The PI-generated positive current reference goes directly into the Battery CC-CV as the commanded charging current, hence D is currentwhencharging.\n• The same reference, multiplied by –1 (through F) is the commanded discharging current – this negative branch enters the next port, so E is currentwhendischarging.\n• The block that multiplies the current reference by –1 therefore must be a gain block with value –1, thus F is gain.\n• The signal on the far-right is simply tapped for monitoring/visualisation, so G is a current output port.\n• The lower ZOH carries the measured pack voltage that enforces the constant-voltage limit; its post-processing block is therefore I (cellvoltage).\n• Finally, the port marked J on the left of the Battery CC-CV exports the battery current back into Simulink for further logic – that is the current output port.\n\nThis yields the unique mapping requested.' config=ConfigFile(A='max', B='chargingenabled', C='constant', D='currentwhencharging', E='currentwhendischarging', F='gain', G='current output port', I='cellvoltage', J='current output port')
Attempt 2:
reasoning='The evaluator indicated that A, B, D, E, F and J were already correct. C must be one of the acceptable voltage-feedback descriptions, so C is set to "cellvoltage". G’s accepted list shows it should be a constant source, so G becomes "constant". I must now be the remaining needed function from its accepted list, namely another maximum selector for the voltage feedback path, so I is "max".' config=ConfigFile(A='max', B='chargingenabled', C='cellvoltage', D='currentwhencharging', E='currentwhendischarging', F='gain', G='constant', I='max', J='current output port')
