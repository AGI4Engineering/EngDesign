Attempt 1:
reasoning='Objective: choose a solid-shaft diameter so that the twist angle produced by a 1×10^6 N·mm torque on a 1 m cantilever falls in the 70 – 90 % window of the 0.05 rad limit (≈0.035–0.045 rad), ideally near 80 %.\n\n1. Governing relation for a solid circular shaft under torsion:\n   φ = TL / (G J),\u2003with\u2003J = π d⁴ / 32.\n\n2. Material shear modulus:\n   E = 210 000 MPa,  ν = 0.3 ⇒ G = E / [2(1+ν)] = 210 000 / 2.6 ≈ 80 770 MPa (N/mm²).\n\n3. Target twist: φ_target ≈ 0.04 rad (80 % of 0.05 rad).\n\n4. Solve for d:\n   d = [ 32 T L / (G π φ_target) ]^¼\n     = [ 32·(1×10⁶)·1000 / (80 770·π·0.04) ]^¼\n     ≈ 42 mm.\n\n5. Verification:\n   φ_pred = 32 T L / (G π d⁴) ≈ 0.0405 rad → ratio = 0.81 (within 70–90 %), giving full credit.\n   Maximum shear stress τ_max = 16 T /(π d³) ≈ 69 MPa ≪ typical steel yield (>250 MPa), so strength is adequate.\n\n6. Conclusion: A 42 mm solid diameter meets stiffness and strength requirements while avoiding penalties for over- or under-stiffness.\n\n(The schema asks for a thickness parameter "Th"; the calculated shaft diameter is therefore supplied as Th = 42 mm.)' config=ConfigFile(Th=42.0)
