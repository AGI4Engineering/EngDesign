Geometry and constraints\n    • Grid 30 × 30, origin at bottom-left.\n    • Robot and pedestrians occupy a 2 × 2 square whose bottom-left corner is reported.\n    • Static obstacles (bottom-left → top-right):\n        O1 (5,0)–(7,15)\n        O2 (10,20)–(20,30)\n        O3 (15,5)–(30,10)\n      The robot’s bottom-left corner must stay outside these boxes so the full body is clear.\n    • Speed limit per axis: |Δx| ≤ 2 and |Δy| ≤ 2 each second.\n    • Goals: A at (5,20) and B at (25,24) – may be visited in either order.\n\n2.  Pedestrian synopsis (t = 0…29)\n    • ped1 remains below y = 18 until t = 9 and afterwards travels east along y = 11.\n    • ped2 approaches the vicinity of Goal A only after t ≈ 22.\n    • ped3 moves west along y = 2 until t = 15, then climbs up the column x = 8.\n\n3.  Path planning strategy\n    a) From start (17,2) move left underneath obstacle O3 (y < 5).\n    b) Ascend the open vertical gap at x = 9 (between O1 and O3) to y = 18: a safe horizontal corridor below O2 and above O3.\n    c) Slide left and reach Goal A at (5,20) by t = 12, well before ped2 arrives.\n    d) Drop back to y = 18, travel east under O2, then ascend to Goal B at (25,24) by t = 24.\n    e) Stay parked at Goal B for the remainder of the horizon.\n\n4.  Validation (checked second-by-second)\n    • Every move respects the speed limit (maximum 2 cells per axis and per second).\n    • Robot’s 2 × 2 footprint never intersects O1, O2 or O3; it stays at y ≤ 19 while under O2 and at y ≥ 18 while above O3, and never enters x 5–7 below y 15.\n    • Minimum clearance to any pedestrian footprint is at least one full cell at all times.\n\n5.  Goal satisfaction\n    • Goal A reached at t = 12.\n    • Goal B reached at t = 24.\n\n6.

Attempt 10:
reasoning='Designing a safe 30-second trajectory that starts at (17,2), visits Goal A (5,20) and Goal B (25,24) in that order, never collides with the three static obstacles or any of the three pedestrians, and respects the per-axis speed limit of 2 cells per second.\n\n1. Static obstacle map (robot’s 2×2 footprint must stay outside):\n   • O1: x 5-7 , y 0-15\n   • O2: x 10-20, y 20-30\n   • O3: x 15-30, y 5-10\n\n2. Pedestrian synopsis (all carry a 2×2 body):\n   • ped1 is below y = 18 until t=9, then marches east along y = 11.\n   • ped2 does not approach x≈5,y≈20 before t≈22.\n   • ped3 moves west along y = 2 until t=15, then climbs the column x = 8.\n\n3. Path-planning idea:\n   a) From t=0 leave the start (17,2) and move left underneath O3 (y<5).\n   b) Use the clear vertical gap at x=9 (between O1 and O3) to climb to y=18—this is a safe horizontal corridor (below O2, above O3).\n   c) Slide left and step up to Goal A at t = 12, before ped2 arrives.\n   d) Drop back to y=18, travel east under O2, then ascend to Goal B at t = 24.\n   e) Park there for the remainder of the horizon.\n\n4. Verification (checked second-by-second):\n   • Every move satisfies |Δx|≤2 and |Δy|≤2.\n   • The 2×2 robot footprint never intersects O1, O2 or O3.\n   • Minimum clearance to any pedestrian footprint is ≥1 full cell at all times.\n   • Goal A reached at t=12, Goal B at t=24.\n\n5.
