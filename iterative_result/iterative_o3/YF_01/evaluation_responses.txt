reasoning='Objective\n--------\nSelect the thickness Th of an L-shaped steel beam so that the maximum out-of-plane (z-direction) displacement produced by the specified in-plane surface tractions stays below the 0.1 mm limit.  A value that is too small would make the part overly flexible, whereas an excessively large value adds weight without improving the score (because the z–displacement is already small).\n\n1.  Cross-sectional geometry\n   • Horizontal leg length  Lh = 50 mm\n   • Vertical   leg length  Lv = 80 mm\n   • Common thickness      Th = t (unknown)\n   • Extrusion height      H  = 50 mm (beam length)\n   \n   For an equal-thickness thin-walled angle section the cross-sectional area is \n        A = t (Lh + Lv – t)   ≈ 130 t  (because t ≪ Lh , Lv).\n\n2.  Resultant forces and torsion\n   Uniform tractions are applied on the free face (ID 5):\n        σx = +10 MPa,  σy = –20 MPa  (σz = 0)\n   Resultant forces\n        Fx = σx·A = 10·A  ,  Fy = σy·A = –20·A  (N)\n   Centroidal coordinates for a thin L-section (origin at the inside corner)\n        x̄ ≈ Lh² /(2(Lh+Lv)) = 9.62 mm\n        ȳ ≈ Lv² /(2(Lh+Lv)) = 24.62 mm\n   The torque about the z-axis is\n        T  = Fx·ȳ – Fy·x̄ = A (10·ȳ + 20·x̄) ≈ 5.70×10⁴ t  N·mm.\n\n3.  Out-of-plane displacement sources\n   (a) Poisson contraction/expansion – independent of thickness.\n        For plane-stress, εz = –ν(σx+σy)/E.\n        σx+σy = –10 MPa ⇒ εz = ν·10/E = 0.3·10 / 21000 ≈ 1.43×10⁻⁴.\n        uz,Poisson = εz·H ≈ 0.000143·50 ≈ 0.007 mm.\n\n   (b) Saint-Venant torsional warping – only weakly dependent on thickness for an open thin-walled angle: ϕ′ = T /(GJ) where J ≈ t (Lh³+Lv³)/3.  Because both T and J are ∝ t, ϕ′ (and hence warping uz) is practically thickness-independent for realistic t.\n\n   (c) Bending from any secondary moments is also minor in the z-direction; its contribution decreases with increasing t but is already orders of magnitude below the 0.1 mm limit for moderate t.\n\n   Adding (a)+(b)+(c) therefore yields a maximum uz on the order of 0.01 mm for any reasonable thickness (1 mm – 10 mm), i.e. not more than ≈10 % of the allowable 0.1 mm.\n\n4.  Thickness selection\n   Since uz is well below the limit and only weakly sensitive to t, the governing consideration becomes practical stiffness and manufacturability.  A 5 mm wall gives:\n        • Cross-section area  A ≈ 130·5 = 650 mm².\n        • Resultant forces   Fx ≈ 6.5 kN,  Fy ≈ –13 kN (easily carried).\n        • Maximum in-plane stresses ≈ the applied tractions (10 MPa/20 MPa) – far below structural steel yield (>250 MPa).\n        • Factor of safety against global buckling ≫ 3 for the 50 mm cantilever length.\n   Thus t = 5 mm provides ample in-plane strength and stiffness while keeping added weight modest.\n\nConclusion\n----------\nA wall thickness of 5 mm satisfies the displacement criterion with significant margin and offers a good balance between rigidity, weight and ease of fabrication.' config=ConfigFile(Th=5.0)

reasoning='Step-1  Recap of known result\nA PDE-Toolbox run that used Th = 5 mm gave\n    umax,z(5 mm) = 0.2159 mm  (> 0.1 mm)\nThis single data pair lets us build a first-order scaling law between the wall thickness and the maximum out-of-plane displacement.\n\nStep-2  Simplified mechanical scaling\nFor an open thin-walled angle section subjected to an in-plane surface traction on its free end, the dominating source of out-of-plane (z) deformation is St-Venant torsional warping of the cross-section.  Torsional rigidity for such a section is\n       G·J  with     J ≈ (Lh³ + Lv³)·t / 3   (open angle, thin wall)\nHence  J ∝ t  ⇒  GJ ∝ t.\nThe rotation per unit length φ′ = T /(GJ) and the associated warping displacement are therefore inversely proportional to the thickness:  uz ∝ 1/t.\n\nStep-3  Calibrated proportionality constant\nUsing the confirmed result at 5 mm we fix the constant C in\n       uz,max(t)  =  C / t\n       0.2159 = C / 5   →  C = 1.0795 mm²\nso\n       uz,max(t) ≈  1.08 / t   (mm)\n\nStep-4  Choose t so that uz falls in the 70-90 % scoring window\nWe want\n       0.07 mm  ≤ uz,max(t) ≤ 0.09 mm\nInsert the model:\n       0.07 ≤ 1.08 / t ≤ 0.09\nwhich yields\n       t ≥ 1.08 / 0.09 = 12.0 mm\n       t ≤ 1.08 / 0.07 = 15.4 mm\nAny thickness between 12 mm and 15 mm should both satisfy the 0.1-mm limit and land inside the peak-score zone.\n\nStep-5  Final selection\nPick a round, easy-to-fabricate value near the middle of that interval:\n       Th = 13 mm\nPredicted displacement with this thickness:\n       uz,max(13) ≈ 1.08 / 13 ≈ 0.083 mm  → 83 % of the 0.1-mm limit\nwhich lies comfortably within the 70-90 % full-credit band while still providing a safety margin below the absolute limit.\n\nStep-6  Sanity check on stresses and practicality\n• Cross-sectional area  A ≈ t (Lh + Lv – t) ≈ 13·(130-13) ≈ 1521 mm².\n• Resultant forces:  Fx = 10·A ≈ 15.2 kN,  Fy = –20·A ≈ –30.4 kN.\n  The resulting average stresses remain exactly the applied tractions (10 MPa, 20 MPa) – far below steel yield (≈250 MPa).\n• Mass increase versus the 5-mm trial is acceptable for the gain in stiffness.\nTherefore Th = 13 mm is a structurally sound and score-optimised choice.' config=ConfigFile(Th=13.0)
