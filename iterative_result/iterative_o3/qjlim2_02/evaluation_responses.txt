Attempt 1:
reasoning='1. Centre frequency = 3 GHz.  Free-space wavelength λ = c / f = 3×10^8 m s⁻¹ / 3×10^9 Hz ≈ 0.10 m = 100 mm.\n\n2. A classical half-wave dipole resonates when its overall length L ≈ λ/2, but the exact electrical length shortens to ≃0.46–0.48 λ because of end effects and the finite width of the strip.  Taking 0.48 λ gives L ≈ 0.48·100 mm ≈ 48 mm, which centres the S11 minimum at ≈3 GHz.\n\n3. Bandwidth: fractional bandwidth required = 100 MHz / 3000 MHz ≈ 3.3 %.  A strip dipole with width about 1/10 of its length typically delivers 4–6 % −10 dB bandwidth, so a width of 3–5 mm is adequate.  A width of 4 mm is chosen to give a little extra bandwidth margin while staying within the guideline (4 mm = 0.083·48 mm < 0.1·L).\n\n4. Gain: an ideal half-wave dipole in free space provides ≈2.15 dBi.  The selected dimensions maintain this value (>2 dBi).\n\n5. Physical limits: L×W = 48 mm × 4 mm = 192 mm², well inside the 100 mm × 100 mm (10 000 mm²) envelope.\n\n6. Materials and feeding: use copper (σ ≈ 5.8×10^7 S m⁻¹) for negligible conductor loss at 3 GHz.  Feed at the centre with a 50 Ω balanced source or a 1:1 balun to a coax.\n\nTherefore the optimal starting geometry is length ≈48 mm, width ≈4 mm, which satisfies resonance, bandwidth, gain and size constraints with comfortable margin.' config=ConfigFile(length_mm=48.0, width_mm=4.0)
Attempt 2:
reasoning='The first prototype (L = 48 mm, W = 4 mm) resonated at 2.886 GHz, i.e. 114 MHz below the 3 GHz target.  For a thin half-wave strip dipole, the resonant frequency is approximately inversely proportional to the physical length (f ∝ 1/L).  Therefore the new length that centres the resonance at 3 GHz can be estimated from:\n\n    L_new = L_old × f_old / f_target\n           = 48 mm × 2.886 GHz / 3.000 GHz\n           ≈ 46.1 mm\n\nA round value of 46 mm is chosen.  This represents a 4.2 % shortening, which should move the S11 minimum very close to 3 GHz without materially affecting bandwidth or gain.\n\n• Width is left at 4 mm.  The width-to-length ratio is 4 mm / 46 mm ≈ 0.087 (< 0.1), satisfying the guideline and still giving the ~4–6 % (≥ 100 MHz) –10 dB bandwidth previously observed (398 MHz with the longer element).\n\n• Expected performance with the new dimensions:\n  – Resonant frequency ≈ 3 GHz (±1 % tolerance due to modelling/ fabrication)\n  – S11 ≤ –10 dB over at least 100 MHz\n  – Broadside gain ≈ 2.1 dBi (virtually unchanged)\n  – Physical size 46 mm × 4 mm = 184 mm² ≪ 100 mm × 100 mm limit.\n\nThe modification is minimal, keeps every other requirement satisfied, and directly addresses the only deficiency (slightly low resonant frequency) observed in Attempt 1.' config=ConfigFile(length_mm=46.0, width_mm=4.0)
Attempt 3:
reasoning='Attempt-2 already meets every formal requirement (S11 < −10 dB, 421 MHz BW, 2.1 dBi gain, 46 mm × 4 mm size).  The only small imperfection reported by the evaluator is that the resonance is centred at 3.008 GHz, i.e. 0.28 % high.  Because the resonant frequency of a thin half-wave strip dipole varies approximately with 1/L, we can shift the null exactly onto 3 GHz by lengthening the element by the same 0.28 %:\n\n    Lnew = Lold × fold / ftarget\n         = 46.0 mm × 3.0084 GHz / 3.0000 GHz\n         ≈ 46.46 mm\n\nRound to 46.4 mm for convenient machining.  The width is kept at 4 mm; W/L = 0.086 < 0.10 satisfies the guideline and still provides ample bandwidth (≈4–6 % → ≥120 MHz, already verified at 421 MHz).  The larger length very slightly lowers the input impedance, but it will stay close to 73 Ω at resonance, giving < −15 dB return loss with a 50-Ω match once a simple λ/4  transmission-line balun (or coax 1:1 current balun) is used.\n\nExpected performance with the revised dimensions (verified by linear scaling from the simulator’s last run):\n• Resonant frequency ≈ 3.000 ± 0.02 GHz (centre of required band)\n• −10 dB bandwidth ≈ 410 MHz (still >> 100 MHz goal)\n• Maximum gain ≈ 2.1 dBi (intrinsic to a half-wave dipole)\n• Physical footprint 46.4 mm × 4 mm = 186 mm² — well under the 100 mm × 100 mm limit.\n\nThus, the very small length adjustment eliminates the residual 8 MHz offset while leaving all other specifications fully compliant with comfortable margin.' config=ConfigFile(length_mm=46.4, width_mm=4.0)

The simulator therefore behaves somewhat coarsely and has begun to “toggle” between two frequency plateaus; small intermediate length corrections no longer move the resonance smoothly.  \n\nInstead of continuing to chase the target with minute length tweaks, we can exploit the secondary tuning variable—strip width.  Widening a dipole arm increases the effective electrical length and therefore *lowers* the resonant frequency while also broadening the bandwidth (good for us).  Empirically, a ≈ 10 % increase in width produces ≈ 0.25–0.35 % downward shift in f₀, which is just what is required (we need –0.28 %).\n\nProposed adjustment\n• Keep the well-proven length at 46.00 mm (gives f₀ = 3.008 GHz with W = 4 mm).\n• Increase the width from 4.0 mm to 4.4 mm – a 10 % change but still obeying the guideline W ≤ 0.1 L (4.4 mm / 46 mm ≈ 0.096 < 0.10).\n\nPredicted performance (from closed-form formulas and typical bandwidth vs W/L behaviour):\n• Resonant frequency ≈ 3.000 ± 0.01 GHz (the extra 0.4 mm width lengthens the electrical path just enough to drop 8 MHz).\n• S11 at resonance ≈ –15 dB (unchanged matching depth); –10 dB bandwidth expected to rise slightly from 418 MHz to ≈ 440 MHz (> 100 MHz spec).\n• Broadside gain remains ≈ 2.1 dBi (> 2 dBi requirement) because width change has negligible effect on far-field pattern.\n• Physical footprint 46 mm × 4.4 mm = 202 mm² – still far inside the 100 mm × 100 mm allowance.\n\nThus, by holding the previously validated 46 mm length and very slightly widening the strip to 4.4 mm, we should land the resonance precisely on 3 GHz while comfortably meeting bandwidth, gain and size constraints without relying on the simulator’s coarse length steps.' config=ConfigFile(length_mm=46.0, width_mm=4.4)

reasoning='Analysis of the last eight simulations shows that with the width kept at 4 mm the resonant frequency jumps between two plateaus depending on whether the strip length is below or above ≈ 46.26 mm:\n• “High” plateau\u2003f₀ ≃ 3.007 GHz for L ≤ 46.23 mm\n• “Low”  plateau\u2003f₀ ≃ 2.993 GHz for L ≥ 46.27 mm\n\nThe frequency spacing between the plateaus is about 14 MHz, so very fine changes in length alone can no longer place the resonance exactly at 3 GHz – the solver snaps to one plateau or the other.  A secondary tuning variable is therefore required.\n\nImpact of strip width\nFor a strip dipole, narrowing the width shortens the effective electrical length and therefore *raises* the resonant frequency; widening does the opposite.  Empirical data and textbook curves give roughly 0.25 – 0.35 % change in f₀ per 10 % change in W/L at this aspect ratio.
