Let m = K^α L^β be the length of the uniform-exploration phase.\n    •  The prescription «pull each arm in a round-robin fashion» is only possible if every arm is sampled at least once, hence m ≥ K.\n    •  By construction the whole experiment lasts T = KL rounds, so necessarily m ≤ T.\n       ⇒  Feasibility wedge :   K ≤ K^α L^β ≤ KL.\n\n2.
