reasoning='1. Represent the quadratic model y = a·x² + b·x + c in matrix form Y = X·β, where each row of X is [x², x, 1].\n2. Build the design matrix with the provided points (x, y):\n   X = [[4, -2, 1], [1, -1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1], [4, 2, 1], [9, 3, 1]]\n   Y = [7.9, 2.0, 0.1, 2.2, 6.0, 12.1]^T\n3. Compute the normal-equation matrices:\n   G = XᵀX  and  d = XᵀY\n   Σx⁴ = 115, Σx³ = 27, Σx² = 19, Σx = 3, n = 6\n   G = [[115, 27, 19],\n        [ 27, 19,  3],\n        [ 19,  3,  6]]\n   d = [Σx²y, Σxy, Σy] = [168.7, 32.7, 30.3]^T\n4. Solve G·β = d (by Gaussian elimination / inverse):\n   a ≈ 1.47893\n   b ≈ −0.47593\n   c ≈ 0.60386\n5. Verify the fit: plug coefficients back, obtain predictions [7.47, 2.56, 0.60, 1.61, 5.57, 12.49] with an MSE ≈ 0.24, indicating a good least-squares fit to the noisy data.' config=ConfigFile(a=1.47893, b=-0.47593, c=0.60386)
