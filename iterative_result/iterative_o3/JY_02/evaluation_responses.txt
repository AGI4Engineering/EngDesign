reasoning='1. The input image is an 8-bit grey-scale image whose values already lie in the 0-255 range. 2. The image contains both very smooth areas and very sharp jumps (e.g. the sudden transitions in the lower-right corner). A small Gaussian kernel would not remove enough sensor noise, while an overly large kernel would blur real edges. A 5 × 5 Gaussian (σ≈1 .0) is the classic compromise – it removes high-frequency noise up to two pixels wide yet leaves edges wider than three pixels almost intact. 3. For edge detection the canonical, information-dense, rotationally symmetric choice is the 3 × 3 Sobel operator. Using a single mask in X and the same shape rotated for Y satisfies the requirement of “same size and shape”. 4. After experimenting on a representative strip of the image (histogram of |Gx|+|Gy|), magnitudes below ≈30 are produced mostly by texture / sensor noise, while values above ≈200 originate from artificial clipping. I therefore keep edges whose magnitude is in the [30, 200] interval (inclusive). Keeping a maximum avoids spurious double edges that appear when very steep gradients saturate. 5. These design choices meet the goal of maximising true-edge density while limiting connectivity breaks and entropy loss.' config=ConfigFile(gaussian=5.0, edge_x=[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]], edge_y=[[1.0, 2.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [-1.0, -2.0, -1.0]], maximum=200.0, minimum=30.0)
