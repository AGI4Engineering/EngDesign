Attempt 1:
reasoning='To design the multi-stage sample rate converter for the LTE receiver, we must first establish the top-level parameters and then determine the reduction factors for the decimating FIR filters. \n\nTask 1:\n- Fpass must accommodate the maximum possible LTE bandwidth of 10 MHz. Considering typical LTE bandwidth requirements, it is reasonable to set Fpass to slightly above 10 MHz to ensure the entire band is passed. A value of 10.5 MHz would typically suffice to accommodate any bandwidth variation.\n- Fstop, the Nyquist rate, is typically FsLTERx/2, which equals 15.36 MHz for our output sample rate of 30.72 MHz. To ensure adequate out-of-band rejection, we might slightly lower Fstop to increase the stopband attenuation, thus providing a more aggressive response. A reasonable assumption would be 15 MHz.\n- Ast, the stopband attenuation, must be high enough to ensure minimal leakage of unwanted signals. A typical value for high-performance systems might be 60 dB.\n- Ap, the passband ripple, generally is kept low to maintain signal integrity. A typical value is 0.1 dB, ensuring minimal distortion within the passband.\n\nTask 2:\n- Factor_1 and Factor_2 are the reduction factors for the final two FIR filter stages. We need to ensure that the combined factor provides a sample rate reduction from the input to the output rate, considering the Farrow rate converter is applied first for fine adjustment. The total reduction needed is 150/30.72 = 4.8828125. After the initial Farrow adjustment, we proceed with integers: assuming a Farrow rate adjustment close to 1, typical values might be Factor_1 = 4 and Factor_2 = 1.25, combined yielding the requisite reduction.\n- We must satisfy conditions: Factor_2 * FsLTERx - 2 * Fpass > 0 MHz; if Factor_2 = 5 (for easier implementation), Factor_2 * FsLTERx = 153.6 MHz, and 2 * Fpass = 21 MHz, so this is satisfied.\n- To meet LTE requirements, ensure EVM constraints are satisfied using filters and precise rate adaptation in MATLAB code provided.' config=Config(Fpass=10.5, Fstop=15.0, Ast=60.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=4.0, Factor_2=5.0)
Attempt 2:
reasoning="To design the multi-stage sample rate converter for the LTE receiver, we must refine our approach to meet the given requirements. \n\nTask 1:\n- The passband frequency, Fpass, needs to accommodate the LTE bandwidth of 10 MHz. We should choose a value slightly higher than 10 MHz to ensure full coverage, such as 10.2 MHz, which also keeps within a reasonable guard band for LTE.\n- The stopband frequency, Fstop, is typically set to the Nyquist rate (FsLTERx/2), which is 15.36 MHz given our output rate. To ensure efficient rejection of out-of-band signals, we might set this at 15.1 MHz to increase the filter's effectiveness.\n- The stopband attenuation, Ast, of 60 dB from the prior attempt seems adequate for reducing unwanted signal leakage. Let's keep Ast at 60 dB.\n- The passband ripple, Ap, affects in-band signal fidelity, so a value of 0.1 dB is purposefully small to ensure high-fidelity.\n\nTask 2:\n- For Factor_1 and Factor_2, after the initial Farrow rate adjustment (fine-tuned to closely achieve the desired overall rate reduction), mainly integer factors further downsample the signal. Since we have Factor_1 = 4 already, we should refine Factor_2 to reduce the EVM errors observed.\n- The total reduction from 150 Msps to 30.72 Msps requires an overall reduction of 150/30.72 = 4.8828125. Considering the prior setup with the Farrow converter producing a precise adjustment, setting Factor_2 = 4 should reduce errors witnessed due to less aggressive final decimation.\n- With Factor_2 set to 4, the requirement Factor_2 * FsLTERx = 122.88 MHz, and 2 * Fpass = 20.4 MHz is satisfied since 122.88 - 20.4 = 102.48 MHz > 0 MHz.\n- This setup should help in meeting the EVM constraints, aiming for RMS and Peak limits specified by LTE requirements using the EVM MATLAB checks." config=Config(Fpass=10200000.0, Fstop=15100000.0, Ast=60.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=4.0, Factor_2=4.0)

However, this should be adjusted to ensure adequate suppression, so we set it slightly lower at 15 MHz. Care must be taken to ensure the transition width is not negative (i.e., Fstop - Fpass > 0).\n- The stopband attenuation, Ast, needs to be high enough to suppress unwanted signals effectively, with 60 dB being a reasonable amount for good suppression.\n- The passband ripple, Ap, is kept at a small value (0.1 dB) to maintain signal integrity.\n\nTask 2:\n- The reduction factors Factor_1 and Factor_2 determine the sample rate reductions of the subsequent decimating FIR filters.
