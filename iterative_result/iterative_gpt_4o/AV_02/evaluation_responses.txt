reasoning="To design a digital IIR filter to eliminate a 120Hz resonant frequency while minimally affecting frequencies very close to it, we can use a notch filter design. A notch filter, or a band-stop filter, strongly attenuates a narrow band of frequencies and passes most other frequencies.

By utilizing the scipy's 'iirnotch' function, which is designed to create a second-order IIR notch filter, we can determine the required filter coefficients. A second-order notch filter is typically sufficient for these constraints.\n\nUsing the `scipy.signal.iirnotch` function:\n- `Q` Factor: This is the quality factor that relates to the bandwidth.

Attempt 2:
reasoning='To design a digital IIR filter to eliminate a 120Hz resonant frequency while minimally affecting frequencies very close to it, we need to accurately design a notch filter. A notch filter prominently attenuates a specific frequency, in this case, 120Hz. The specifications require attenuation of over 40dB at 120Hz, and less than 3dB of attenuation at 115Hz and 125Hz.\n\nGiven a sampling frequency of 2000Hz, the notch filter should use the `iirnotch` function from the scipy library. The `w0` parameter (notch frequency) is calculated as 120 divided by the Nyquist frequency (2000/2), resulting in 0.12. The `Q` value (quality factor) determines the sharpness of the notch. A good approximation for the necessary `Q` can be derived experimentally or through iterative testing to ensure surrounding frequencies are minimally affected.\n\nBy specifying a sufficiently high `Q` value, which confines the notch filter effect to a narrow frequency range, we can achieve the desired attenuation characteristics.\n\nPrevious tests indicated a more comprehensive approach using a higher-order filter might be necessary, or alternatively, a more finely tuned Q value. Based on further testing and adjustments, the filter design can be refined to effectively meet the specifications.

Attempt 3:
reasoning="In the previous attempts, the notch filter was designed to specifically target and attenuate the resonant frequency at 120Hz while maintaining minimal impact on frequencies around it at a sampling rate of 2000Hz. However, the feedback indicates the design did not achieve the desired attenuation characteristics at the specified frequencies. Given this, further calibration and adjustment in the design parameters, particularly the quality factor (Q) and filter order, may be necessary. Therefore, to achieve the desired criterion, it's essential to iteratively adjust these parameters ensuring a higher level of attenuation at 120Hz while keeping attenuation below 3dB at 115Hz and 125Hz. By recalculating and reinstating a more refined Q factor and verifying the coefficients using simulations or analysis, a more successful filter design could be achieved. Given the evaluation responses, it might be useful to opt for a notch filter with a higher Q factor and possibly examine higher-order filter solutions or tune the current second-order solution.

reasoning="To design a digital IIR filter to eliminate a 120Hz resonant frequency with minimal impact on nearby frequencies at a sampling rate of 2000Hz, we need to address the prior shortcomings where the designed filter did not adequately meet the specifications. The key is to carefully choose the quality factor (Q) and filter order to achieve the desired frequency response. By conducting detailed simulations using a tool like SciPy, we can adjust the filter's parameters for precise control over the notch's bandwidth and depth. Given the previous feedback indicated inadequacies across these parameters, a higher-order filter might be necessary, or a refined Q factor should be explored. Recalculating these parameters through iterative testing, while ensuring that frequencies at 115Hz and 125Hz remain unaffected (attenuation below 3dB) and a strong attenuation (more than 40dB) at 120Hz is achieved, requires adjustments in design.

Attempt 5:
reasoning="Given the earlier attempts to design a digital IIR filter for eliminating a 120Hz resonant frequency, the feedback highlights inadequate performance despite the order and coefficient relation being appropriate. The goal is to implement a filter using the scipy.signal library's `iirnotch` function. In previous attempts, the choice of Q factor might not have been optimal. The notch frequency is determined by the ratio of 120Hz to the Nyquist frequency (1000Hz), resulting in 0.12. The Q value is crucial for achieving the required narrow attenuation, particularly for attenuating frequencies sharply at 120Hz with a 40dB cut-off, while ensuring frequencies at 115Hz and 125Hz experience less than 3dB attenuation. To achieve this, I recommend exploring a range of Q values, generally in the high tens to low hundreds, and using frequency response analysis through simulation to verify the specific characteristics required by this task. Testing with a higher-order filter beyond the second order could also improve performance but would require additional testing to ensure minimal passband distortion below and above the target frequency.

reasoning='The feedback from the previous attempts indicates that the provided filter configuration did not meet the necessary attenuation requirements at 115Hz, 120Hz, and 125Hz, despite having a reasonable order and proper coefficient relation. In this attempt, the focus is on adjusting the quality factor (Q) and potentially increasing the filter order to achieve a sharper notch filter that meets these specific requirements.\n\nThe key steps to improve the design are as follows:\n\n1. **Re-evaluate the filter design approach:** Use a notch filter which is appropriate for eliminating a specific resonant frequency. Given the failure of previous attempts with a Q factor around 30 – start by increasing this Q factor. A higher Q implies a narrower bandwidth, thus sharper rejection at 120Hz while having minimal effect at 115Hz and 125Hz.\n\n2. **Frequency Scaling:** Recalculate the notch frequency using w0 = 120Hz / 1000Hz (normalized frequency for fs=2000Hz) which results in 0.12 rad/sample, already adequately applied previously but requires focus on Q for precise Bandwidth control.\n\n3. **Adjust Q Factor and Order Appropriately:** Experiment with a much higher Q factor closer to 60 or 70 initially then tweak as testing demands, analyzing frequency response for each. Also, reconsider increasing the order of the filter if Q adjustment isn’t sufficient alone, although simplicity is preferred if possible.\n\n4. **Use SciPy to Design Filter:** Utilize the `iirnotch` function ensuring the adjusted Q achieves greater compliance with specifications, trying different theoretical Q values (e.g. 60, then 80) while evaluating spectrum plots to meet the constraints effectively.\n\nThe next test accounts for more aggressive Q adjustments while ensuring surrounding frequencies meet attenuation criteria.' config=ConfigFile(order=2.0, coeffs_numerator=[1.0, -1.8477590650225733, 1.0], coeffs_denominator=[1.0, -1.892066821803518, 0.9803921568627451])

reasoning="After analyzing the feedback from previous attempts, it's clear the proposed filter configuration consistently failed to meet the attenuation requirements at specified frequencies. The main parameter needing adjustment is the quality factor (Q), which controls the width and depth of the notch.

The primary issue seems to be that the previously used Q factor wasn't sufficient. By using the `scipy.signal.iirnotch` function, focus should be placed on choosing a more appropriate Q factor or, if required, exploring a higher-order filter. It is recommended to start experimenting with a higher Q factor, potentially increasing it to a range between 70-100 to ensure a sharper notch at 120Hz.

Firstly, ensuring that the notch is placed precisely at a normalized frequency of 0.12 (corresponding to 120Hz with a sampling rate of 2000Hz) is essential. We should also focus more on using a high Q value to achieve a narrow bandwidth; previous attempts with a Q factor of ~30 were insufficient. It's recommended to try out Q values between 70 and 100.
