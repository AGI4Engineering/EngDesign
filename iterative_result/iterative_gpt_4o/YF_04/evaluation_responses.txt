reasoning='To determine a suitable diameter for the steel shaft, we need to ensure that the twist angle at the free end does not exceed the allowable limit of 0.05 rad. The twist angle ϕ can be expressed by the formula: ϕ = (T * L) / (G * J), where T is the applied torque, L is the length of the shaft, G is the shear modulus of the material, and J is the polar moment of inertia of the shaft cross-section. \n\nFor steel with a Young’s modulus of 210,000 MPa and Poisson’s ratio of 0.3, G can be calculated as: G = E / [2 * (1 + ν)] = 210,000 / [2 * (1 + 0.3)] = 80,769.23 MPa.\n\nThe polar moment of inertia for a solid circular section is J = (π/32) * d^4, where d is the diameter. Substituting the expressions for G and J into the formula for ϕ:\n\nϕ = (T * L) / [(E / (2 * (1 + ν))) * (π/32) * d^4]\n\nThe allowable twist angle is given as ϕ_allow = 0.05 rad. Solving for d so that ϕ equals 0.9 * ϕ_allow to satisfy the performance criterion:\n\n0.9 * ϕ_allow = (T * L * 32) / (π * E * d^4)\n\nPlugging in the values T = 1,000,000 N·mm, L = 1000 mm, E = 210,000 MPa (which is 210,000 N/mm^2):\n\n0.9 * 0.05 = (1,000,000 * 1000 * 32) / (π * 210,000 * d^4)\n\nSolving the above equation gives d ≈ 78.53 mm. To ensure its safety and to fit well within the optimal performance criterion, we choose a slightly larger diameter. Therefore, I propose a diameter of 80 mm for the steel shaft.' config=ConfigFile(Th=80.0)
