To address these shortcomings, a more balanced and calculated approach towards MOSFET sizing is required.\n\n1. **Enhancing DC Gain and CMRR:**\n   - Adequately sizing the PMOS devices, P0 and P1, increases output resistance thereby boosting gain. The lengths should not be exaggerated to avoid excess capacitance which can throttle the bandwidth.\n   - Wider NMOS transistors ensure higher transconductance, vital for gain but lengths should ensure operation in saturation and to control short-channel effects.\n\n2. **Increasing Unity-Gain Frequency (UGF):**\n   - Wider NMOS and PMOS increase transconductance over gate capacitance, crucial for UGF. Adjusting lengths to slightly larger values than minimum while ensuring saturation helps retain frequency despite loading.\n\n3. **Tuning Strategy:**\n   - Balance transistor sizing while ensuring proper VDS and VGS for operation within saturation.\n   - Capitalize on high transconductance-to-parasitic capacitance ratio by focusing incrementally on current mirroring strength with NMOS and load sharing with PMOS.\n\nOverall, these tuning adjustments aim to adequately address gains and frequency target challenges while reconciling previous downfalls in ICMR attributed to asymmetrical gate drive characteristics and resulting in suboptimal UGF and DC gain values.' config=ConfigFile(netlist='// Library name: MP3\n// Cell name: ota\n// View name: schematic\nsubckt ota VDD VSS ibp10u vin vip vout\n N3 (ibp10u ibp10u VSS VSS) tsmc18dN w=90.0u l=0.36u as=1.35068e-11 ad=1.35068e-11 ps=60.93u pd=60.93u m=2 region=sat\n N2 (net7 ibp10u VSS VSS) tsmc18dN w=700.0u l=0.36u as=2.16007e-10 ad=2.16007e-10 ps=960.93u pd=960.93u m=6 region=sat\n N5 (vout vin net7 net7) tsmc18dN w=100.0u l=0.36u as=100.0e-11 ad=100.0e-11 ps=62.50u pd=62.50u m=4 region=sat\n N4 (net8 vip net7 net7) tsmc18dN w=100.0u l=0.36u as=100.0e-11 ad=100.0e-11 ps=62.50u pd=62.50u m=4 region=sat\n P1 (net8 net8 VDD VDD) tsmc18dP w=130.0u l=0.36u as=300.0e-11 ad=300.0e-11 ps=45.00u pd=45.00u m=4 region=sat\n P0 (vout net8 VDD VDD) tsmc18dP w=130.0u l=0.36u as=300.0e-11 ad=300.0e-11 ps=45.00u pd=45.00u m=4 region=sat\nends ota\n// Library name: MP3\n// Cell name: dut\n// View name: schematic\nI16 (net1 net2 net6 net4 net3 net5) ota')
Attempt 10:
reasoning='In all the previous attempts, the OTA failed to meet performance expectations, specifically in terms of DC gain, unity-gain frequency (UGF), and common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR). It is evident from the feedback that each attempt struggled with obtaining a sufficient UGF while maintaining adequate gain and CMRR. This points towards the necessity of a more balanced approach in terms of device sizing that ensures high transconductance with minimized parasitic effects and an optimal biasing that can tolerate a wide range of input common-mode levels.\n\nGiven the prior shortcomings, my strategy includes the following optimizations:\n1. **Transistor Sizing**:\n   - Enhance NMOS and PMOS widths for effective transconductance, essential for UGF and gain improvements.\n   - Opt for minimal channel lengths permissible that ensures saturation and minimized short-channel effects, thus promoting higher frequency operation.\n   - Experiment with ratios of width to length that balance drive strength and minimize parasitics.\n\n2. **Symmetrical Configurations**:\n   - Ensure symmetry in the differential pairs (N4, N5) and load transistors (P0, P1) to augment CMRR and compensate for the mismatch.\n   - Tail current source (N3) should have adequate width to provide consistent biasing over variations.\n\n3. **Adjustment of Multipliers**:\n   - Optimize the multiplier (m) to effectively scale device characteristics such as gm without introducing excessive parasitics.\n\n4. **Iterative Simulation Feedback Process**:\n   - Postulate a regime where sizes are incrementally adjusted with simultaneous follow-up simulation to evaluate UGF, gain, and CMRR compliance.\n\nThe newly suggested configurations should theoretically augment both gain and frequency specs without incurring detrimental increases in parasitics. Utilizing minimal and careful device adjustments following these guidelines, a viable solution for the OTA performance problem is attainable. This involves optimizing trade-offs between size of MOSFETs to ensure dynamic stability under varying conditions and feedback analysis iteratively revisiting these until a balance is struck.' config=ConfigFile(netlist='// Library name: MP3\n// Cell name: ota\n// View name: schematic\nsubckt ota VDD VSS ibp10u vin vip vout\n    N3 (ibp10u ibp10u VSS VSS) tsmc18dN w=100.0u l=0.18u as=1.35068e-11 ad=1.35068e-11 ps=61.0u pd=61.0u m=2 region=sat\n    N2 (net7 ibp10u VSS VSS) tsmc18dN w=700.0u l=0.18u as=2.16007e-10 ad=2.16007e-10 ps=970.0u pd=970.0u m=6 region=sat\n    N5 (vout vin net7 net7) tsmc18dN w=110.0u l=0.18u as=102.0e-11 ad=102.0e-11 ps=64.0u pd=64.0u m=4 region=sat\n    N4 (net8 vip net7 net7) tsmc18dN w=110.0u l=0.18u as=102.0e-11 ad=102.0e-11 ps=64.0u pd=64.0u m=4 region=sat\n    P1 (net8 net8 VDD VDD) tsmc18dP w=140.0u l=0.18u as=310.0e-11 ad=310.0e-11 ps=47.0u pd=47.0u m=4 region=sat\n    P0 (vout net8 VDD VDD) tsmc18dP w=140.0u l=0.18u as=310.0e-11 ad=310.0e-11 ps=47.0u pd=47.0u m=4 region=sat\nends ota\n// Library name: MP3\n// Cell name: dut\n// View name: schematic\nI16 (net1 net2 net6 net4 net3 net5) ota')
