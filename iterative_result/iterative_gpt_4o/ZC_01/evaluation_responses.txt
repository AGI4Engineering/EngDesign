reasoning="To design a static state-feedback gain matrix K that ensures robust stability and H-infinity performance, we follow a systematic approach using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The system is described by the state-space equations with uncertainties in the matrix A and an additional dynamic uncertainty in the feedback loop. First, we recognize the uncertainties present: a parametric uncertainty in the system matrix A and a feedback uncertainty Delta_dyn such that its H-infinity norm is bounded by 1. To handle these, the uncertain matrix A is expressed as: A = A_0 + Delta A, where Delta A is in the convex hull Co{+-0.2 I_4}. The objective is to find a state feedback u = Kx such that the closed-loop system is robustly stable and satisfies a desired H-infinity performance of ||T_zw||_inf < 0.3. These requirements can be checked by solving an SDP for a common Lyapunov function using a robust LMI condition that incorporates the effect of the uncertainties and guarantees the desired H-infinity performance via bounded real lemma. We follow these steps: 1. Formulate the closed-loop system dynamics considering the uncertainties in A. 2. Construct an LMI condition that guarantees robust stabilization considering all admissible Delta A. 3. Incorporate an H-infinity norm condition for the transfer function T_zw, ensuring it is less than 0.3. 4. Solve the resulting LMI using a numerical solver like MATLAB's YALMIP or similar to obtain the gain matrix K. Upon solving these LMIs, a feasible solution provides us with the matrix K, ensuring that both robust stability and performance criteria are met." config=ConfigFile(K=[-0.4302, -3.5821, -1.4375, -0.2987])
