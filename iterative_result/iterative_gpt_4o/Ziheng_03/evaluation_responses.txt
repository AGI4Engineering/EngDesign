Settling time Ts < 5s: This requires tuning principally Kp and Kd to modify the system dynamics and achieve faster settling without introducing excessive overshoot.\n2. Overshoot < 20%: Increasing Kd helps in reducing the overshoot by providing damping to the system.\n3. Zero steady state error to a unit step input: This can be achieved by introducing integrator action through Ki which ensures zero steady state error.\n4. Gain margin > 10dB and Phase margin > 45 degrees: These are frequency domain specifications which require careful balancing of Kp, Ki, and Kd to ensure the overall gain around the control loop is within acceptable stability margins.\n\nUsing a PID design approach, trial-and-error tuning, or computational tools (e.g., MATLAB Sisotool or a root-locus approach) could be used. Based on typical experience and common tuning rules such as Ziegler-Nichols for systems of similar order and complexity:\n\n1. Kp (Proportional Gain): Generally, we start with a moderate value to improve responsiveness without causing too much overshoot.\n2. Ki (Integral Gain): This is often set to a lower value compared to Kp to ensure zero steady state error without making the system too oscillatory.\n3.
