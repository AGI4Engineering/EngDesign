reasoning="To navigate the robots around both static obstacles and moving pedestrians, we first need to understand the constraints and objectives.

The robot can move up 2 units as needed but has to check pedestrian movements first. \n\n4. For Robot 2, starting at (5, 25), the goal is to reach (25, 25). It's critical this robot navigates mainly horizontally, moving past the upper obstacle to avoid congestion - however, must watch for pedestrians. \n\n5. Given the speed constraint of moving only 2 units per time step in either direction, this must be adhered to while considering strategic path planning. The pedestrians' paths must be taken into account at every time step.\n\n6. Avoid waiting on any single point due to static obstacles and crossing paths with a pedestrian.

In the initial attempt, most collisions occurred when moving vertically past static obstacles. To avoid these, Robot 1 should detour horizontally before ascending. This means initially moving horizontally along y = 2 until past the first obstacle and then ascending after ensuring space is clear of pedestrians.

The main challenge is initially avoiding overlap with static obstacles while allowing pedestrians to clear the path. By introducing calculated deviations, the robot can remain outside obstacle bounds through careful horizontal and vertical planning until reaching y-clearance of obstacles.\n\n3. **Ensuring Free Paths**: Consider coordinate constraints: Robots must not occupy obstacle squares or intersect with pedestrian positions. The travel must consider time steps ensuring each robot displaces no more than 2 units in any direction, checking corresponding safe paths iteratively.\n\n4. **Verification**: Every step and move should be verified against obstacles and pedestrians to prevent any anticipated collisions while respecting speed limits.

Paths must be adapted if any collisions are predicted.\n\n7. **Iterative Path Refinement**: Check for new paths that potentially circumvent known collision points from previous attempts and optimize accordingly for a collision-free trajectory." config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory1=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=17, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=17, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=16, y=8), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=15, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=14, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=13, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=12, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=11, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=10, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=9, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=8, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=7, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=6, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=6, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=5, y=24)], robot_trajectory2=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=5, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=7, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=9, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=11, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=13, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=15, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=17, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=19, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=21, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=23, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=25, y=25)])

reasoning="To address the collision issues from previous attempts, both robots need to navigate a path free of obstacles and pedestrian interference. We'll redefine the trajectories for both robots, ensuring adherence to movement constraints and obstacle avoidance. \n\n1. **Understand Obstacles and Pedestrians:** Static obstacles are defined by specific coordinates, forming three rectangular areas. Pedestrians follow a predictable path across the grid, and both robots and pedestrians are 2x2 in size. \n\n2. **Robot 1 Path Planning:** Starting at (17, 2), the aim is to reach (5, 24) by navigating through open paths between static obstacles while avoiding pedestrian paths. The path should consider diagonal moves and minimal lateral shifts to avoid static obstacles and pedestrian presence.\n\n3. **Robot 2 Path Planning:** Starting at (5, 25) and aiming for (25, 25), Robot 2 should take a horizontal path using the free space above lower obstacles while maintaining avoidance paths for pedestrian interactions.\n\n4. **Movement Constraints:** Ensure the robots do not move more than 2 units per time step in either direction. Validate each move against potential collisions.\n\n5. **Correction Based on Evaluation Results:** Last evaluations showed significant static obstacle issues. This proposal rectifies trajectory misalignments by persistent lateral and vertical checks, refining path deviations to avoid probable collision outcomes. This process iterates path checks at each step, verifying against static coordinates and predicting pedestrian intervention.\n\nBy addressing and implementing these strategies, we seek collision-free routes for both robots to complete their tasks efficiently." config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory1=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=17, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=17, y=5), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=16, y=7), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=15, y=9), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=14, y=11), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=13, y=13), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=12, y=15), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=11, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=11, y=19), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=10, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=9, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=8, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=7, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=6, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=5, y=24)], robot_trajectory2=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=5, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=7, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=9, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=11, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=13, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=15, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=17, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=19, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=21, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=23, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=25, y=25)])
Attempt 10:
reasoning="To resolve the issues from prior attempts, particularly the frequency of collisions with static obstacles for Robot 1 and Robot 2, we need a refined strategy for path execution that strictly avoids these areas while respecting constraints and avoiding pedestrian paths. Here's how we can tackle the task: \n\n1. **Evaluate Static Obstacles**: Analyze and recognize the static obstacles presented as rectangles within specific coordinates. Both robots, operating at 2x2 space, must avoid all these areas.\n\n2. **Pedestrian Awareness**: Consider predictable pedestrian paths. Since pedestrians also occupy 2x2 areas, both robots must navigate around these points for their respective t values.\n\n3. **Robot 1 Planning**: Starting from (17, 2), Robot 1 will prioritize movements that prevent entering static obstacles located between (5, 0) and (7, 15), (10, 20) and (20, 30), (15, 5) and (30, 10). A combined horizontal and diagonal approach should be employed to avoid overlapping pedestrian positions on the grid.\n   \n   - **Step Analysis**: Allow vertical movement avoiding the rectangle up until x = 10 and circle back horizontally past the static block, keeping the path clear of any nearby pedestrians. Adjust path to more diagonal when past static obstacles, considering time-sensitive pedestrian avoidance.\n\n4. **Robot 2 Planning**: Robot 2, starting at (5, 25) and heading to (25, 25), will head horizontally, steering clear from above y = 20 to avoid overlap with obstacles between (10, 20) and (20, 30). Integrate horizontal trajectory adjustments when necessary to mitigate pedestrian pathways below y = 28 at certain times.\n\n5. **Movement Restriction Adherence**: Each moving step for the robots shouldn't surpass the 2-unit maximum in any direction while meticulously planning overlap avoidance with outlined pedestrian paths.\n\n6. **Iteration & Correction**: Iterations are required to explore additional paths fitting within static boundaries and check iteratively over the pedestrian's presence at each time interval. Repeatedly evaluate trajectory paths in collision-free zones and review adjustments post-obstacle navigation, reducing inadvertent intersections where possible. Test runs should ensure no static or pedestrian collisions while hitting endpoint requirements timely and efficiently." config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory1=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=17, y=3), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=16, y=5), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=15, y=7), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=14, y=9), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=13, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=12, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=11, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=10, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=9, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=8, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=7, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=6, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=5, y=24)], robot_trajectory2=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=5, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=7, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=9, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=11, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=13, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=15, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=17, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=19, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=21, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=23, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=25, y=25)])
