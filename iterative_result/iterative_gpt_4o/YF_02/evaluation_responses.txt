reasoning="To determine a suitable thickness (Th) for the rectangular steel beam, the aim is to ensure that the maximum vertical displacement (uy) under load does not exceed 1 mm. The beam is simply supported and subjected to two forces of 1000 N each, applied at quarter-span locations. The critical parameters include Young’s modulus of 210,000 MPa and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.3, which influence the beam's stiffness. The width of the beam is fixed at 40 mm. The goal is to design a beam with adequate stiffness to meet the displacement criteria, while also being efficient in material use. By using the beam bending theory, the displacement for a simply supported beam loaded at quarter points can be approximated. The moment of inertia (I) for a rectangular section is a function of the beam's thickness, Th, and its width. A thicker beam will have a greater moment of inertia, which reduces displacement. Initial estimations suggest starting with a Th of around 20 mm to 30 mm would potentially meet the criteria. From practical experience and typical engineering assumptions, a thickness of 25 mm is proposed. This value balances the need for structural integrity and limits excess material use while keeping maximum displacement within acceptable limits." config=ConfigFile(Th=25.0)
