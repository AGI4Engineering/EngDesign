reasoning='To solve the problem, we first need to formulate the initial loop-shaping controller C(s) based on the given plant G(s) and the specified loop bandwidth. \n\n### Task 1\n1. **Plant Transfer Function Calculation**: \n   - The plant is given as G(s) = 0.5/s * 169/(s^2 + 0.26s + 169). At the bandwidth ω_L = 1 rad/sec, we need to evaluate |G(jω_L)|. For ω = 1, \n   - G(jω_L) = 0.5/(j*1) * 169/((j1)^2 + 0.26*j*1 + 169) = 0.5/1 * 169/(169.26) = 0.5*169/169.26. The magnitude is approximately |G(jω_L)| ≈ 0.5.\n2. **Initial Controller Gain (K_g)**:\n   - K_g = 1/|G(jω_L)| ≈ 2 (since |G(jω_L)| is about 0.5).\n3. **Integral Boost (K_i(s))**:\n   - Given β_b = sqrt(10), the integral boost term is: \n   K_i(s) = (sqrt(10)s + 1)/(s sqrt(10+1)) = (3.162s + 1)/(s 3.317).\n4. **Transfer Function of C(s)**:\n   - Combine K_g and K_i(s): \n   C(s) = K_g * K_i(s) = 2 * ((3.162s + 1)/(s * 3.317)).\n   - Therefore, C(s) has a numerator [2*3.162, 2] and denominator [3.317, 0].\n\n### Task 2\nTo stabilize the system and adhere to the requirements of phase margin and gain margin, we need to design a roll-off filter K_r(s).\n1. **Roll-off Parameters**:\n   - Based on the requirement of stability and gain/phase margin, set β_r = 0.707 (typical damping ratio) and ω_r = 12.5 (between the additional gain crossings of 12.5 and 13.4 rad/sec).\n2. **Roll-off Transfer Function**:\n   - F_r(s) = ((0.707 * 12.5)^2) / (s^2 + 2*0.707*12.5s + (0.707*12.5)^2).\n   - Normalize this by |F_r(jω_r)| at ω_r = 12.5.\n3. **Final Controller C(s)**:\n   - C(s) = K_g * K_i(s) * K_r(s). The roll-off ensures stability and appropriate phase/gain margins.\n\nThus, the design incorporates all the goals, providing a stable closed-loop with specified margins.' config=ConfigFile(C_num=[6.324, 2.0], C_den=[3.317, 0.0], omega_r=12.5, beta_r=0.707)
