The worst-case maximum delay between refreshes, considering ±100 ppm clock tolerance and up to a 5 clock cycle delay in the logic, can be calculated.

Attempt 2:
reasoning="To ensure each digit in our 4-digit hexadecimal display refreshes at least 60Hz, the total refresh frequency required is 4 times 60, which equals 240Hz. This means the display as a whole needs to cycle through all four digits 240 times per second. Given the FPGA clock of 50 MHz, the required division ratio to achieve 240Hz can be calculated as the clock frequency divided by the desired frequency: 50,000,000 / 240 = approximately 208333.3. Rounding up, the division ratio needed is 208334. To find the minimum number of counter bits n such that 2^n >= 208334, we determine that 2^18 = 262144 is the smallest power of 2 that exceeds 208334, so n must be 18. For digit selection within a 4-value cycle, two consecutive counter bits that can effectively cycle through 4 values are needed; thus, we choose bits [17, 16] from the counter, which will cycle through 00, 01, 10, and 11. The justification for choosing bits [17, 16] is that they are consecutive, high-order bits that transition every 65536 clock cycles (characteristic of the selected counter configuration), ensuring each value in the 4-digit cycle is displayed sequentially at a regular interval. Considering worst-case conditions, including the ±100 ppm clock tolerance and up to 5 clock cycles delay in logic, we calculate the nominal refresh period as 1/240 = approximately 4.1667ms, adjusted for tolerance to give 4.166916667ms. Adding 5 cycle delays, the maximum delay becomes: 4.166916667ms + (5 cycles / 50,000,000 Hz) = 4.166916667ms + 0.0001ms = 4.167016667ms. Checking against the flicker threshold of 33.33ms, we can say no, flickering isn't possible because 4.167016667ms is much less than 33.33ms.
