reasoning='To estimate the required thickness for limiting the maximum deflection to 0.5 mm under a uniform pressure of 2 N/mm² on a 1000×500 mm rectangular plate with all edges clamped, we use classical plate-bending theory. A standard formula for maximum deflection of a rectangular plate is w_max = C×(p×a^4)/(E×t^3), where C depends on Poisson’s ratio and the aspect ratio. For a plate of 2:1 aspect ratio with E=210000 MPa, ν=0.3, and a uniform load p=2 N/mm², the resulting thickness to achieve around 0.5 mm deflection is approximately 30 mm. This accommodates the increased deflection due to the 2:1 aspect ratio and ensures a deflection ratio near unity when compared with the 0.5 mm limit.' config=ConfigFile(Th=30.0)
