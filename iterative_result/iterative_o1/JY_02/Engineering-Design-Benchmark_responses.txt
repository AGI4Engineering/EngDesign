Attempt 1:
reasoning='1) We apply a Gaussian blur with a 3x3 kernel to smooth the input image. 2) We then use a standard Sobel edge detection approach. The Sobel X kernel (edge_x) responds to horizontal changes, while the Sobel Y kernel (edge_y) responds to vertical changes. 3) We define a minimum threshold to remove weak edges and a maximum threshold to clip strong edges. This balances edge detection performance by filtering out noise while preserving the main edges of the image.' config=ConfigFile(gaussian=3.0, edge_x=[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]], edge_y=[[-1.0, -2.0, -1.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0, 1.0]], maximum=200.0, minimum=30.0)
Attempt 2:
reasoning='In this updated approach, we address the previous zero-edge detection by selecting a moderately small Gaussian smoothing (σ=1.4) to gently blur while retaining important features. We switch to the Scharr operator for stronger gradient amplification, which helps enhance edges more than the standard Sobel operator. Finally, we set a lower minimum threshold (15.0) and higher maximum threshold (255.0) to allow more edges to pass through, ensuring that weaker but valid edges are preserved while still clipping excessively strong values if needed. This should increase edge density and connectivity while improving overall signal-to-noise ratio.' config=ConfigFile(gaussian=1.4, edge_x=[[3.0, 0.0, -3.0], [10.0, 0.0, -10.0], [3.0, 0.0, -3.0]], edge_y=[[3.0, 10.0, 3.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [-3.0, -10.0, -3.0]], maximum=255.0, minimum=15.0)
Attempt 3:
reasoning='Based on the earlier attempts with zero edge detection, it appears the thresholds used were too restrictive or the gradient magnitude was insufficient to surpass their values. In this revised approach, we apply a stronger Gaussian blur (σ=2.0) with a slightly larger kernel size, ensuring that we reduce high-frequency noise while preserving relevant edges. We then adopt a standard 3×3 Sobel operator with slightly boosted coefficients to enhance gradient magnitudes further. Finally, we lower the minimum threshold to 5.0, leaving the maximum threshold at 255.0, thereby including more subtle edges while still clipping only the strongest outliers. This should help improve edge density, connectivity, and entropy, producing a more robust edge map.' config=ConfigFile(gaussian=2.0, edge_x=[[-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-4.0, 0.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0]], edge_y=[[-2.0, -4.0, -2.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [2.0, 4.0, 2.0]], maximum=255.0, minimum=5.0)
Attempt 4:
reasoning='1) We apply a Gaussian blur with a 5×5 kernel size to sufficiently smooth the image and reduce high-frequency noise while preserving key edges. 2) We then use a slightly boosted Sobel-like operator for horizontal (edge_x) and vertical (edge_y) gradient detection. These kernels help increase the gradient magnitudes, making the edges more pronounced. 3) Finally, we keep a wide threshold range, with a minimum of 10 to allow more subtle edges to remain, and a maximum of 255 to discard only the most extreme values. This approach should yield increased edge density and connectivity compared to previous attempts, and avoid errors regarding valid kernel sizes.' config=ConfigFile(gaussian=5.0, edge_x=[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-4.0, 0.0, 4.0], [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]], edge_y=[[-1.0, -4.0, -1.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 4.0, 1.0]], maximum=255.0, minimum=10.0)
Attempt 5:
reasoning='1) We choose a Gaussian kernel size of 3 (which is a valid odd integer) to smooth out high-frequency noise without overly blurring the image. 2) We apply a standard 3×3 Sobel operator in the X and Y directions, which is known to detect horizontal and vertical edges effectively. 3) To avoid cutting out valid but slightly weaker edges, we lower the minimum threshold to 2.0 and keep a wide maximum threshold of 255.0, thus allowing more edges to be included while still clipping only the largest magnitudes. This approach should increase edge density and connectivity while preserving important edge structures in the image.' config=ConfigFile(gaussian=3.0, edge_x=[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]], edge_y=[[-1.0, -2.0, -1.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0, 1.0]], maximum=255.0, minimum=2.0)
Attempt 6:
reasoning='To address the prior feedback about zero edge detections, we will apply the following revisions: 1) Use a 5×5 Gaussian blur (gaussian=5) to sufficiently smooth the image and reduce noise without overly suppressing real edges. 2) Utilize a stronger edge filter proposed by Scharr-like operators, thereby increasing gradient magnitudes. The horizontal (edge_x) and vertical (edge_y) kernels are scaled to enhance edge responses, making them more likely to exceed the threshold. 3) Lower the minimum threshold (minimum=1) so that meaningful edges are not suppressed, and keep the maximum threshold (maximum=255) high enough to avoid clipping strong edges. This approach should yield more robust and continuous edges, increasing edge density and connectivity.' config=ConfigFile(gaussian=5.0, edge_x=[[-3.0, 0.0, 3.0], [-10.0, 0.0, 10.0], [-3.0, 0.0, 3.0]], edge_y=[[-3.0, -10.0, -3.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [3.0, 10.0, 3.0]], maximum=255.0, minimum=1.0)
Attempt 7:
reasoning='To avoid the previous issue of zero edge detection, we will increase the Gaussian kernel size to 7 (which is a valid odd number) to smooth the image more significantly and reduce noise. We then apply a Scharr-like operator with larger coefficients, enhancing gradient responses so they exceed the thresholds. Finally, we set the minimum threshold to 0.0 (allowing even small gradients to appear) and keep the maximum at 255.0 to accommodate strong edges without clipping. This combination should yield higher edge density, better connectivity, and a broader distribution of edge intensities.' config=ConfigFile(gaussian=7.0, edge_x=[[-5.0, 0.0, 5.0], [-20.0, 0.0, 20.0], [-5.0, 0.0, 5.0]], edge_y=[[-5.0, -20.0, -5.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [5.0, 20.0, 5.0]], maximum=255.0, minimum=0.0)
Attempt 8:
reasoning='In previous attempts, either the thresholding or smoothing led to either no detected edges or only one large connected edge region. Here, we propose increasing the Gaussian blur kernel size to 7 to reduce noise more thoroughly while preserving essential edges. Then we apply a Scharr-like operator with moderately high coefficients, which yields stronger gradient responses than the standard Sobel. Finally, we set a slightly higher minimum threshold (10.0) so that obvious noise does not appear as edges, but weaker real edges can still emerge, while the maximum is kept at 255.0 to avoid clipping strong edges. This should yield a more distributed set of edges, thereby improving edge density, connectivity, and entropy over past attempts.' config=ConfigFile(gaussian=7.0, edge_x=[[-3.0, 0.0, 3.0], [-10.0, 0.0, 10.0], [-3.0, 0.0, 3.0]], edge_y=[[-3.0, -10.0, -3.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [3.0, 10.0, 3.0]], maximum=255.0, minimum=10.0)
Attempt 9:
reasoning='In previous attempts, either the thresholds were too high (causing no edges) or too low (causing a single giant edge), or the Gaussian kernel was too large/small for effective smoothing. Here, we will try a balanced approach: (1) We use a 7×7 Gaussian blur to reduce noise, which is an odd integer kernel size valid for OpenCV and sufficiently large to smooth out high-frequency components. (2) We switch to a Sobel-like operator with slightly stronger weights than standard Sobel, boosting the gradient magnitudes: edge_x = [[-2, 0, 2], [-8, 0, 8], [-2, 0, 2]] and edge_y = [[-2, -8, -2], [0, 0, 0], [2, 8, 2]]. This should help meaningful edges cross the threshold. (3) We pick a minimum threshold of 5.0, allowing weaker edges to appear without including excessive noise, and keep the maximum threshold at 255.0 to avoid clipping strong edges. This combination should improve edge density, connectivity, and entropy while avoiding the zero-edge results and single-edge-region scenarios seen in prior attempts.' config=ConfigFile(gaussian=7.0, edge_x=[[-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-8.0, 0.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0]], edge_y=[[-2.0, -8.0, -2.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [2.0, 8.0, 2.0]], maximum=255.0, minimum=5.0)
Attempt 10:
reasoning='In the previous attempts, the Gaussian kernels or thresholds often caused either no edges or a single massive edge region. Here, we opt for a 9×9 Gaussian blur, which is large enough to reduce high-frequency noise while preserving broader structures. Then, we apply a stronger, Scharr-like 3×3 operator in both x and y directions (edge_x and edge_y) to boost gradient magnitudes and help distinct edges cross our threshold. Finally, we set a low minimum threshold (2.0) so even moderate edges are included, and keep the maximum threshold high (255.0) to avoid clipping strong edges. This balance should yield better edge density, connectivity, and overall entropy while avoiding the zero-edge issue or collapsing edges into a single region.' config=ConfigFile(gaussian=9.0, edge_x=[[-4.0, 0.0, 4.0], [-12.0, 0.0, 12.0], [-4.0, 0.0, 4.0]], edge_y=[[-4.0, -12.0, -4.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [4.0, 12.0, 4.0]], maximum=255.0, minimum=2.0)
