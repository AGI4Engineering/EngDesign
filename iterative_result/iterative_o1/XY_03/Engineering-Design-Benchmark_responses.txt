Attempt 3:
reasoning="1) Each digit needs to refresh at ≥60Hz, giving a total multiplexed refresh rate of 4×60Hz=240Hz.\n2) From a 50MHz clock, dividing by 240Hz requires a division ratio of about 50,000,000/240≈208,333.\n3) Since 2^17=131,072<208,333 but 2^18=262,144≥208,333, the smallest n is 18.\n4) We can select bits [17:16] from the 18-bit counter to create four distinct states (00→01→10→11), each driving a different digit.\n5) Higher-order bits naturally partition the counter into four equally spaced states and simplify the logic implementation.\n6) With bits [17:16], the entire 4-digit cycle nominally takes 4×(2^16)/50e6=5.24288ms. In the worst case, one just misses a digit's refresh and must wait up to nearly two full cycles (about 10.48576ms).

Attempt 4:
reasoning='1) Each of the 4 digits must be at least 60\u202fHz, so total (system-wide) refresh is 4×60\u202fHz\u202f=\u202f240\u202fHz.\n2) Dividing 50\u202fMHz by 240\u202fHz gives a division ratio of 50,000,000\u202f/\u202f240 ≈\u202f208,333.\n3) The smallest integer n such that 2ⁿ ≥\u202f208,333 is n\u202f=\u202f18 (because 2¹⁷\u202f=\u202f131,072 <\u202f208,333 and 2¹⁸\u202f=\u202f262,144\u202f≥\u202f208,333).\n4) We choose bits [17,16] from the counter for digit selection, since these two bits naturally cycle 00→01→10→11.\n5) High-order bits cycle evenly through 4 distinct states without extra logic. This matches the typical "case" structure for driving the four digit lines.\n\nTo interpret the actual rate:\n• An 18-bit counter runs at 50\u202fMHz, so its entire 0→(2¹⁸\u202f−\u202f1) count cycle is 262,144\u202fclock cycles. That cycle repeats 50,000,000\u202f/\u202f262,144 ≈\u202f190.7\u202ftimes per second.\n• However, the design logic picks a new digit on each of the four quarter-states (00,\u202f01,\u202f10,\u202f11) inside that full cycle. Therefore, from one specific digit’s refresh to the very next time that same digit is activated requires dividing the 190.7\u202ftotal-cycles-per-second by 4. That yields each digit at about 190.7\u202f/\u202f4\u202f=\u202f47.675\u202fHz, i.e., each digit is updated every ≈21\u202fms.\n\n6) For worst-case delay, assume the data for a given digit changes just after its time slot ended. In that scenario, the new data will not appear until the digit’s next turn, which is roughly a 21\u202fms wait. Also include ±100\u202fppm clock variation and up to 5 clock cycles of internal logic delay:\n• A 100\u202fppm slow clock adds a small fraction (≈0.002\u202fms) over 21\u202fms.\n• 5 clock cycles at 50\u202fMHz (or slightly less) adds ~0.0001\u202fms.\nHence the maximum delay stays around 21\u202fms (about 21.002\u202fms worst-case), which is less than the 33.33\u202fms flicker threshold.\n7) Since 21\u202fms <\u202f33.33\u202fms, flicker at or above 30\u202fHz is unlikely to be perceived; therefore, is_flicker_possible\u202f=\u202fFalse from the 30\u202fHz physiological perspective.

However, that yields a total multiplex rate of 50e6/262,144≈190.7Hz (i.e. ~47.7Hz per digit), which is below the required 60Hz per digit. Therefore, we actually choose n=17 (2^17=131,072), which is below 208,333 but results in a faster actual refresh (~381Hz total ⇒ ~95Hz per digit) that meets the ≥60Hz requirement.\n4) We pick bits [16,15] for digit selection because those two bits yield four distinct states (00→01→10→11) in a clean cycle.\n5) Reasoning: using higher bits naturally creates evenly spaced intervals for the 4-digit multiplex.\n6) With n=17, the entire 4-digit cycle is 131,072 clock cycles. At 50MHz, that is 131,072/50e6=2.62144ms. Worst case, if the clock runs slow by 100ppm, we add ~0.000262ms, plus up to ~0.0001ms (5 clock cycles), giving ≈2.622ms for the maximum time until the same digit updates again.\n7) Since 2.622ms ≪ 33.33ms, it is well above any 30Hz flicker threshold, so no flicker is perceived.\n' config=ConfigFile(counter_bits=17, division_ratio=131072, digit_select_bits=[16, 15], bit_select_reasoning='Bits [16,15] cycle cleanly through four states to drive each digit in turn, ensuring ~95Hz per digit.', max_delay_ms=2.622, is_flicker_possible=False, mitigation_strategy='No additional mitigation is needed since 2.622ms < 33.33ms, eliminating flicker concerns.')
Attempt 6:

Since 2^17=131,072<208,333 and 2^18=262,144≥208,333, we choose n=18.\n\n4) Two bits must cycle through 00→01→10→11 (four states) for digit selection. Bits [17,16] in the 18-bit counter do exactly that.\n\n5) Using [17,16] is straightforward: every quarter of the counter's range, these bits move to the next of the four combinations. This cleanly drives each of the four digit outputs.\n\n6) Under the intended 240\u202fHz total cycle, each digit reappears every 1/60\u202fs≈16.667\u202fms (since 60\u202fHz per digit). Worst-case includes ±100\u202fppm clock tolerance, so at a slightly slower clock we might add about 0.0017\u202fms. Also account for up to 5 extra clock cycles in the logic (5\u202f/\u202f50\u202fMHz=0.0001\u202fms). Altogether, the maximum gap between updates of the same digit is about 16.67\u202fms+0.002\u202fms≈16.672\u202fms, which is well below 33.33\u202fms.\n\n7) Because 16.672\u202fms corresponds to about 60\u202fHz (well above the 30\u202fHz flicker threshold), flicker is not perceptible.

Attempt 7:
reasoning='1) We need each digit to refresh at ≥60\u202fHz, and since there are 4 digits (time-division multiplexed), the total stepping rate (digit0→digit1→digit2→digit3→digit0) must be 4×60=240\u202fHz.\n2) From a 50\u202fMHz clock, the precise division required to get exactly 240\u202fHz is 50,000,000/240 ≈208,333.\n3) We then pick the smallest integer n so that 2^n≥208,333.
