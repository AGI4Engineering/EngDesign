Attempt 1:
reasoning="To satisfy the requirement of at least 3.0 m/s top speed, we use the motor's maximum speed of 4000 rpm, which is about 66.7 rev/s. With a gear ratio of 6.5 and a wheel diameter of 0.1 m, the wheel speed at max motor rpm is about (66.7 / 6.5) × π × 0.1 ≈ 3.22 m/s, which surpasses 3.0 m/s. Next, climbing a 10-degree incline for a total mass of 10 kg requires a force of m×g×sin(10°) plus rolling resistance (0.015 × m × g × cos(10°)), totaling roughly 1.855×m newtons. At a wheel radius of 0.05 m, the wheel torque is below the motor’s maximum torque when geared down 6.5:1, so the climb is feasible. Finally, level cruising at 2.5 m/s for 30 minutes primarily consumes rolling-resistance and minor drag power; the estimated total electrical energy for 30 minutes is small (under about 5–6 Wh for a 10 kg robot). A 20 Wh battery provides more than enough capacity for a 30-minute run, even allowing for inefficiencies and overhead. Therefore, the chosen parameters (gear ratio 6.5, wheel diameter 0.1 m, battery capacity 20 Wh, and mass 10 kg) fulfill the three constraints." config=ConfigFile(battery_capacity=20.0, gear_ratio=6.5, wheel_diameter=0.1, body_mass=10.0)
