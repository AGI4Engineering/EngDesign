Here we use r=0.997, improving attenuation at 120 Hz beyond 40 dB while testing minimal impact (less than 3 dB attenuation) at 115 Hz and 125 Hz.

Attempt 5:
reasoning='In previous attempts, a second-order (biquad) IIR notch filter with zeros on the unit circle at the digital frequency for 120Hz and poles slightly inside has been used. Each time, the passband at 115Hz and 125Hz was correct (less than 3dB attenuation), but the attenuation at 120Hz failed to surpass the 40dB requirement due to slight numerical inaccuracies. Theoretically, a second-order notch filter can achieve infinite attenuation exactly at the notch frequency if the zeros lie exactly on the unit circle. In practice, however, finite precision and small errors can reduce that attenuation. To address this, we push the pole radius even closer to the unit circle (r=0.9999) and include more precise values for cos(ω0), where ω0 = 2π×(120/2000). This yields deeper attenuation at the target frequency while maintaining a very narrow notch (so that frequencies 5Hz below and above are minimally affected).

Attempt 6:
reasoning='In the previous attempts, all solutions tried a single (second-order) notch filter. While a theoretical second-order notch can provide infinite attenuation at the center frequency, small deviations due to finite precision led to less than 40 dB attenuation in practice. To address this, a fourth-order filter is constructed by cascading two identical second-order notch filters centered at 120 Hz: effectively squaring the second-order transfer function. This approach deepens the notch, ensuring more than 40 dB attenuation at 120 Hz. By keeping the poles close to the unit circle (r = 0.999), the notch remains very narrow, minimizing attenuation at 115 Hz and 125 Hz. Let ω0 = 2π * (120 / 2000) = 0.37699111843 rad/sample and C = cos(ω0) ≈ 0.928476690885. A second-order notch section is H2(z) = (1 - 2C z⁻¹ + z⁻²) / (1 - 2rC z⁻¹ + r² z⁻²). The fourth-order filter is H4(z) = [H2(z)]². Expanding the numerator and denominator polynomials yields the following coefficients.

reasoning='To address the feedback that a single second-order notch filter never achieved the required >40 dB attenuation at 120 Hz (even though the passband at ±5 Hz was acceptable), we construct a fourth-order notch filter by cascading (squaring) one very narrow second-order section.

reasoning='In previous attempts, a single second-order (biquad) notch filter was not able to achieve the required −40 dB attenuation at exactly 120 Hz (the resonant frequency) while maintaining less than 3 dB attenuation at 115 Hz and 125 Hz. A fourth-order filter, obtained by cascading (squaring) a second-order notch, was tried, but the passband near 115 Hz and/or 125 Hz ended up too attenuated.\n\nTo address both problems (deeper notch at 120 Hz and minimal attenuation at 115 Hz and 125 Hz), we use a two-step solution:\n\n1) We design a second-order digital notch (bandstop) filter H₂(z) with half the desired 3 dB bandwidth. Because we want ±5 Hz around 120 Hz to remain above −3 dB, we first design each second-order section to be −3 dB at only ±2.5 Hz around 120 Hz. In terms of normalized radians per sample:\n   - The center frequency is ω₀ = 2π × (120 / 2000) ≈ 0.376991118.\n   - The half-bandwidth is 2.5 Hz, i.e. halfBW = 2π × (2.5 / 2000) = 0.00785398 rad/sample.\n\n   Using the standard iirnotch(ω₀, BW) formula (where we substitute halfBW for BW), the filter coefficients for the second-order section H₂(z) are computed:\n\n   α = (1 − tan( halfBW / 2 )) / (1 + tan( halfBW / 2 ))   (gives its notch sharpness)\n   b = [ (1+α)/2 , −(1+α) cos(ω₀) , (1+α)/2 ]\n   a = [ 1, −2 α cos(ω₀), α² ].\n\n   Numerically, α is about 0.9922, and cos(ω₀) ≈ 0.9284767. This yields:\n   b ≈ [0.9961, −1.8500, 0.9961],  a ≈ [1, −1.8430, 0.9845].\n\n2) We create the final fourth-order filter by cascading two identical copies of the second-order section, i.e. H₄(z) = H₂(z) × H₂(z).

The very small difference from r=1 shrinks the notch bandwidth, ensuring that 115 Hz and 125 Hz lie well outside the notch region, thereby keeping attenuation below 3 dB there.
