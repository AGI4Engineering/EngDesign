reasoning="1) The static obstacles are: (5,0)-(7,15), (10,20)-(20,30), (15,5)-(30,10). The robot is 2×2, starts at (17,2), and must visit Goal A (5,20) and Goal B (25,24).

Attempt 4:
reasoning='After carefully analyzing the static obstacles and the pedestrians’ 2×2 bounding boxes from t=0..29, as well as the speed limit of 2 cells per time step in x or y, one finds that no collision-free path exists that starts at (17,2) and visits both goals (5,20) and (25,24) within the 30-step time window. The main difficulties are:\n\n1) Obstacle #3 (covering x=15..30, y=5..10) blocks direct passage at mid-heights when x ≥ 15, forcing the robot to either stay below y=3 or above y=10 before crossing x≥15.\n2) Obstacle #2 (x=10..20, y=20..30) prevents passing across x=10..20 if the robot’s y+2 ≥ 20, effectively requiring the robot to drop below y=18 when crossing that x-range.\n3) Obstacle #1 (x=5..7, y=0..15) blocks the low corridor for x ≤ 7 unless the robot goes fully around it on the right or above y=15.\n4) The three pedestrians’ moving 2×2 bounding boxes further constrain any timeline through narrow corridors. Ped3, in particular, occupies the lower region (near y=2) while sweeping from x=25 to x=8, forcing the robot to move significantly left or risk collision. Meanwhile ped1 and ped2 roam the mid-to-high region, blocking or delaying the path.\n5) Attempting to reach Goal A first (at (5,20)) and then crossing the map to Goal B (at (25,24)) requires bypassing obstacles #1 and #2 plus timing around pedestrians, which under the 2-cells-per-step speed limit exceeds the 30-step time horizon. Likewise, trying Goal B first and then Goal A is also thwarted by obstacles #2 and #3 plus the pedestrians’ coverage.\n\nIn all tested routes that truly avoid overlapping bounding boxes with pedestrians or obstacles, the total required time exceeds t=29.

Attempt 5:
reasoning='After intensive attempts to chart a collision-free path within 30 time steps that visits both goals (5,20) and (25,24) from the start (17,2), it appears impossible to avoid static obstacles and the 2×2 bounding boxes of the three pedestrians. Obstacles #1 (5..7,0..15), #2 (10..20,20..30), and #3 (15..30,5..10) create narrow corridors; meanwhile, pedestrians occupy critical regions at overlapping times, blocking speedy travel. Careful checks of feasible routes show that the robot would collide with a pedestrian or an obstacle (especially around x=15..21,y=12..20 where ped2 and ped3 move) if it tries to cross fast enough. Slowing or waiting out pedestrians exceeds the 30-step limit.
