Evaluating |G(j3)| numerically yields approximately 0.176, so K_g ≈ 5.68. The integral-boost factor is K_i(s) = (β_b s + ω_L) / (s sqrt(β_b^2 + 1)) with β_b = sqrt(10) and ω_L = 3. Hence β_b^2 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11. Thus K_i(s) = [ sqrt(10) s + 3 ] / [ s sqrt(11) ]. Multiplying by K_g gives C(s) = (5.68 / sqrt(11)) * ( sqrt(10) s + 3 ) / s.
