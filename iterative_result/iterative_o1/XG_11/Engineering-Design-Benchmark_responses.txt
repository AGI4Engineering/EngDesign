Evaluating at j1 gives |G(j1)| ≈ 0.503, so the controller gain is Kg = 1/0.503 ≈ 1.988. 2) The integral boost is Ki(s) = (βb s + ωL) / (s √(βb² + 1)), with βb = √10 and ωL = 1. Substituting gives Ki(s) = (√10 s + 1) / (s √11). 3) Multiplying by Kg, we get C(s) = (Kg / √11)(√10 s + 1)/s. Numerically, that constant is 1.988 / 3.3166 ≈ 0.599, and multiplying 0.599 × √10 ≈ 1.897. That yields the initial loop shaping controller C(s) = (1.897 s + 0.599)/s. 4) To ensure stability at 1 rad/s bandwidth and to avoid high-frequency gain crossings, a roll-off filter Kr(s) is introduced.

The magnitude of the denominator is |j1| × |168 + j0.26| = 1 × √(168² + 0.26²) ≈ 168.0002. Hence, |G(j1)| ≈ 84.5 / 168.0002 = 0.502976, which gives the controller gain Kg = 1/|G(j1)| ≈ 1.98817.\n\n2) The integral boost is Ki(s) = (βb s + ωL) / [ s √(βb² + 1) ] with βb = √10 and ωL = 1.

That factor multiplied by √10 for the s-term gives (1.8967) for the s coefficient, and 0.5992 for the constant term. Therefore, the initial loop-shaping controller can be expressed as:\n  C(s) = (1.8967 s + 0.5992)/s.\n\n4) Because the closed-loop system is still unstable at high frequencies (with additional gain crossings above 12 rad/s), we add the second-order roll-off:\n   Fr(s) = ( (βr ωr)² ) / [ s² + √2 βr ωr s + (βr ωr)² ],\n   Kr(s) = Fr(s) / |Fr(j ωr)|.\n   Choosing βr = 1 and ωr = 10, yields (βr ωr)² = 100.
