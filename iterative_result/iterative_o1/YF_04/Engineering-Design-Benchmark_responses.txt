reasoning='To ensure the twist angle remains below the 0.05 rad threshold, we use the torsion formula φ = T·L / (G·J). With T = 1e6 N·mm, L = 1000 mm, and G ≈ 80,800 MPa (derived from G = E / [2(1 + ν)]), the polar moment of inertia for a circular cross-section (J = π·D^4/32) must be large enough to keep φ ≤ 0.05 rad. Solving indicates a minimum diameter of approximately 40 mm, ensuring adequate stiffness to keep the twist angle within allowable limits while avoiding excessive material use.' config=ConfigFile(Th=40.0)
