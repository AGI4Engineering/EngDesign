reasoning='1) From the quarter-car equations and the given parameters (m_b=300, m_w=60, k_s=16000, b_s=1000, k_t=190000), the linearized state-space matrices A and B follow directly by collecting terms in ẋ=Ax+Bu, where x=[x_b; ẋ_b; x_w; ẋ_w] and u=[r; f_s].\n   • The first row (ẋ₁) depends only on x₂.\n   • The second row (ẋ₂) includes −(1/300)[k_s(x₁−x₃)+b_s(x₂−x₄)−1000 f_s].\n   • The third row (ẋ₃) depends only on x₄.\n   • The fourth row (ẋ₄) includes (1/60)[k_s(x₁−x₃)+b_s(x₂−x₄)−k_t(x₃−r)−1000 f_s].\n2) Substituting numeric values and distributing yields:\n   A =\n   [  0        1        0        0       \n   -53.3333  -3.3333   53.3333   3.3333 \n     0        0        0        1      \n   266.6667  16.6667 -3433.3333 -16.6667 ]\n   \n   B =\n   [    0         0      \n        0      3.3333  \n        0         0      \n     3166.6667 -16.6667 ]\n3) In the baseline design, beta=0.01 gave an RMS of 0.014 m, a peak of 0.0309 m, and an energy attenuation of about 57%. To meet the new requirements (RMS ≤ 0.012 m, peak ≤ 0.035 m, and energy attenuation ≤ 35%), one can choose a different beta (e.g., β=0.50). This adjusts the weighting between handling and comfort in hinfsyn so as to reduce the RMS and peak body travel while controlling the overall energy attenuation under 35%.' config=ConfigFile(A=[[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [-53.3333, -3.3333, 53.3333, 3.3333], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], [266.6667, 16.6667, -3433.3333, -16.6667]], B=[[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 3.3333], [0.0, 0.0], [3166.6667, -16.6667]], beta=0.5)
