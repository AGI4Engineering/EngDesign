Attempt 1:
reasoning='By approximating the maximum deflection for two 1000 N loads placed at quarter-span, the required thickness can be estimated using the beam-bending deflection formula. A rough calculation suggests that around 39 mm thickness keeps the deflection near 0.8 mm, which is within the 70â€“90% target range relative to the 1 mm limit. This choice balances material usage and structural performance, ensuring the beam is neither overly stiff nor prone to excessive deflection.' config=ConfigFile(Th=39.0)
