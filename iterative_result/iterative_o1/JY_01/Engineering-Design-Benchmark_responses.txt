The input Stokes vector is S_in = [1, 0.6, 0.2, 0], and the goal is to achieve S_out = [0.3, -0.3, 0, 0].\n\nStep 1: Choose the first linear polarizer at a1 = 0° (horizontal). For an ideal polarizer at 0°, the transmitted light is horizontally polarized, and one standard result is that the outgoing Stokes vector becomes:\n   S1 = [ (1 + 0.6)/2, (1 + 0.6)/2, 0, 0 ] = [0.8, 0.8, 0, 0 ].\n\nStep 2: Pass S1 through a quarter-wave plate (QWP) at angle a2. We use a2 = 30°, though 60° (and their ±-equivalents) also work. With the sign conventions for an ideal QWP (retardance π/2) and standard rotation matrices in Stokes space, one finds:\n   • After the QWP at a2 = 30°, the intermediate Stokes vector S2 satisfies  I2 − Q2 = 0.6.\n   • Concretely, the calculation shows S2 ≈ [0.8, 0.2, (some value), (some value)], ensuring I2 = 0.8 and Q2 = 0.2.\n\nStep 3: The final linear polarizer at a3 = 90° (vertical). In an ideal Mueller description, a polarizer at 90° transmits the vertical component with intensity proportional to (I2 − Q2)/2. Here, I2 − Q2 = 0.6, so the transmitted intensity is 0.3.

This helps address sign or convention mismatches that may have appeared in earlier runs, because flipping the sign on the QWP angle can change the handedness of the induced phase but still achieve the correct final polarization state and amplitude.\n' config=ConfigFile(angle12=0.0, angle22=-30.0, angle32=90.0)

Angles are measured from the horizontal and must lie in the range −180° to +180°.\n\nKey observation:\n• The desired final Stokes vector S_out = [0.3, -0.3, 0, 0] can be generated by passing an intermediate state S2 = [I2, Q2, U2, V2] = [I2, Q2, 0, 0] through a final polarizer at 90° (vertical). For an ideal polarizer at 90°, the transmitted intensity is (I2 − Q2)/2, and the resulting Stokes vector is [ (I2 − Q2)/2, −(I2 − Q2)/2, 0, 0 ], provided U2 = V2 = 0.\n\nHence to achieve [0.3, −0.3, 0, 0], we need:\n(1) U2 = 0 and V2 = 0.\n(2) (I2 − Q2)/2 = 0.3 ⇒ I2 − Q2 = 0.6.\n\nThus the second element (quarter-wave plate) plus the first polarizer must produce a purely linear state S2 = [I2, Q2, 0, 0] with I2 − Q2 = 0.6.\n\nStep 1: First polarizer at angle a1.\n\nAn ideal linear polarizer at angle a1 imparts the Mueller matrix:\n  P(a1) = (1/2) * [ [1 + cos(2a1), sin(2a1),     0, 0],\n                    [sin(2a1),     1 - cos(2a1), 0, 0],\n                    [0,            0,            0, 0],\n                    [0,            0,            0, 0] ].\n\nApplying P(a1) to S_in = [1, 0.6, 0.2, 0] yields:\n  S1(0) = (1/2)[ 1 + cos(2a1) + 0.6 sin(2a1) ].\n  S1(1) = (1/2)[ sin(2a1) + 0.6(1 − cos(2a1)) ].\n  S1(2) = 0, S1(3) = 0.\n\nStep 2: Quarter-wave plate (QWP) at angle a2.\n\n• For an ideal QWP with fast axis at angle a2, the next output S2 is R(a2) M_QWP(0) R(−a2) S1, where M_QWP(0) is the standard QWP matrix with fast axis horizontal. However, if we choose a2 = 0°, then the QWP’s fast axis is aligned with the horizontal, and acting on a purely linear state with U1 = V1 = 0 does not introduce any extra U or V. In that special case S2 = S1.\n\nHence with a2 = 0°, we get S2 = [I1, Q1, 0, 0].\nWe then want I2 ≡ I1 and Q2 ≡ Q1 to satisfy I1 − Q1 = 0.6.\n\nStep 3: Final polarizer at angle a3 = 90°.\n\n• An ideal linear polarizer at 90° yields S_out = [(I2 − Q2)/2, −(I2 − Q2)/2, 0, 0].

A key point is that the quarter-wave plate can shift the polarization from purely linear (after the first polarizer) into an elliptical state that, when projected by the final polarizer, yields the desired Stokes amplitude 0.3 rather than 0.2.\n\nBelow is a concise reasoning:\n\n1) First linear polarizer at angle a1 = 0° (horizontal):\n   • The standard Mueller matrix for a polarizer at 0° picks off horizontal polarization, ignoring the input U component.

In short, it boosts (I2 − Q2) to the necessary 0.6.
