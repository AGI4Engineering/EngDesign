Attempt 1:
reasoning='Step-by-step justification:\n1) The geometry is an L-profile with horizontal length Lh = 50 mm, vertical length Lv = 80 mm, fillet radius Rf = 20 mm, and extrusion height of 50 mm.\n2) A uniform surface traction [10, -20, 0] N/mm² is applied on Face 5, while Face 4 is fixed; the material has E = 21000 MPa and ν = 0.3.\n3) A simple bounding calculation (idealizing the beam as a cantilever loaded by a net force derived from the traction) overestimates the thickness requirement (greater than 100 mm) if we assume the entire face is loaded and the vertical leg takes all the moment alone. In reality, the L-shape provides additional stiffness, and the actual loaded area and load path are more complex, lowering the needed thickness.\n4) Based on typical steel bracket design practice for the given dimensions and anticipated stresses, a thickness of 12 mm is selected to achieve a maximum deflection close to but under the 0.1 mm limit, likely keeping the deflection ratio within 70–90% of the allowable displacement.\n5) This thickness offers a practical balance between structural rigidity and material economy.' config=ConfigFile(Th=12.0)
