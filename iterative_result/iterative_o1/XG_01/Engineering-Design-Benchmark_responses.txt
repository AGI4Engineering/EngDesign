Attempt 1:
reasoning='We want a target loop shape of 8/s for a crossover frequency near 8 rad/s and lower gain at high frequencies; in transfer function form, this is captured by numerator [8] and denominator [1, 0]. For loopsyn, we select alpha=0.7 as a compromise between performance (matching the desired loop shape) and robust stability (ensuring at least 0.05 disk margin).' config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.7)
Attempt 2:
reasoning='To reduce the performance gamma below 1, we can place more emphasis on matching the desired loop shape 8/s. Lowering the alpha value in loopsyn shifts the balance towards performance rather than robustness. For example, setting alpha to 0.4 may better match the loop shape 8/s, thus reducing gamma. At the same time, the disk margin is expected to remain above 0.05, satisfying the stability requirement.' config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.4)
Attempt 3:
reasoning='From the previous attempts, lowering alpha improved performance (reducing gamma), but we must keep the disk margin above 0.05. Attempt 2 with alpha=0.4 gave us a disk margin of about 0.115 and gamma of about 1.17, which suggests we can push alpha lower to try to reduce gamma below 1. Reducing alpha shifts the design emphasis more toward matching the desired target loop shape (8/s). Thus, I will try alpha=0.3, which should further reduce gamma while likely maintaining a disk margin above 0.05. If gamma is still not below 1, we could reduce alpha even more, although we risk reducing the disk margin too low. However, alpha=0.3 is a reasonable next step to balance performance and robustness, aiming for gamma < 1 while keeping disk margin ≥ 0.05.' config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.3)
Attempt 4:
reasoning="From the previous attempts, each reduction in alpha decreased gamma but also lowered the disk margin. With alpha=0.3, gamma was 1.06 and the disk margin stayed above 0.05, but gamma did not fall below 1. To further reduce gamma, I'll lower alpha to 0.2. This should bring gamma closer to or under 1 while keeping the disk margin above 0.05. Hence, I'll retain the same target loop shape 8/s but choose alpha=0.2 to balance performance (achieve gamma<1) and robustness (disk margin≥0.05)." config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.2)
