Attempt 1:
reasoning='1) To cover at least 4000 m horizontally in a V-shape while diving and climbing 400 m, we select a 10° glide angle. The total horizontal distance for each 400 m leg is (400 × cot(10°)) ≈ 2268.5 m, giving about 4537 m round-trip. 2) With an average glide speed of 1 m/s, the total path time (2 × (400 / sin(10°))) is around 1.28 hours, under the 2-hour limit. 3) To keep density under water density (1025 kg/m³), we choose a 0.3 m³ volume and 250 kg total mass, yielding a density of about 833 kg/m³. 4) The power consumption is P(z) = 100 W + 0.05 W/kg × 250 kg + 0.2 W/m × z = 112.5 W + 0.2 z. Integrating over depth from 0 to 400 m for both legs yields about 195 Wh total, under the 200 Wh battery capacity. Thus, these values satisfy time, distance, energy, volume, and mass constraints.' config=ConfigFile(angle=10.0, volume=0.3, mass=250.0)
