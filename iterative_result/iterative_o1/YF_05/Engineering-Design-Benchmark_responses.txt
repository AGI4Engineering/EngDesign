Attempt 1:
reasoning='To maintain the maximum nodal displacement just below 0.5 mm while also aiming for a deflection ratio (δ/0.5 mm) between 70% and 90%, we can approximate the contributions of the diagonal (Node1–Node3) and vertical (Node2–Node3) members to the vertical stiffness. The diagonal element has a length of roughly 1414 mm with a 100 mm² area, giving an axial stiffness of about 14,852 N/mm. Because the element is at a 45° angle, its effective vertical stiffness is about half of that (∼7,426 N/mm). For the vertical member, its axial stiffness is 210 × A (N/mm)—since E = 210,000 N/mm² and the length is 1,000 mm. Summing both contributions and setting the total required stiffness Ktotal = 4000 N / 0.4 mm = 10,000 N/mm yields A ≈ 12 mm². This results in a total deflection of around 0.4 mm, which is 80% of the allowable 0.5 mm, landing comfortably in the 70–90% range. This area ensures the structure is sufficiently stiff while optimizing material usage.' config=ConfigFile(Th=12.0)
Attempt 2:
reasoning='From Attempt 1, using A=12 mm² resulted in excessive stress (333 MPa > 250 MPa) and a large displacement (2.24 mm > 0.5 mm). To reduce displacement to about 0.4 mm (an 80% ratio of the permissible 0.5 mm), the area must increase by roughly a factor of 2.24/0.4 ≈ 5.6 relative to 12 mm². This yields ~67 mm². Rounding up slightly to 70 mm² ensures both stress (4000 N / 70 mm² ≈ 57 MPa) and displacement remain comfortably within limits, targeting the desirable 70–90% threshold region for maximum points.' config=ConfigFile(Th=70.0)
