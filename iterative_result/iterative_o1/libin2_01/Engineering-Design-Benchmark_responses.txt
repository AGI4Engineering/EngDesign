Attempt 2:
reasoning='1) We must accommodate 40-bit virtual addresses (byte-addressable) with each PTE = 8 bytes. 2) To cover 40 bits, we split into offset bits (12 for a 4 KB page) plus 28 index bits across three levels. A suitable breakdown is: L1: 9 bits (512 entries), L2: 9 bits (512 entries), L3: 10 bits (1024 entries). This matches 12 + 9 + 9 + 10 = 40 bits.\n\n3) Each multi-level page-table page is 4 KB and holds 512 PTEs if the level has 9 index bits, or up to two 4 KB pages if the level has 10 index bits (1024 entries). We allocate only as many page-table pages as needed to map the physical region.\n\n4) TLB hit rate for a 4 KB page size is about h = exp(-0.1542 * (4 - 5.82)^2) ≈ 0.60. TLB access time = 20 ns; per-level PTE access time = 100 ns.

Attempt 4:
reasoning='1) We have 40-bit virtual addresses, 4 KB pages (2^12 bytes), so there are 12 offset bits and 28 index bits to be split across the page-table levels. 2) We choose a three-level scheme with index-bit splits of [9, 9, 10]. The first two levels each have 512 entries, and the third level has 1024 entries. Since each PTE is 8 bytes and each page table is 4 KB in size, the last level with 1024 entries requires two physical pages per leaf table. 3) For the TLB hit rate, using the page-size-based formula h(page_size) = exp(-0.1542 * (page_size/1024 - 5.82)^2), we get h(4096) ≈ 0.60. 4) The average address-translation time accounts for always paying the TLB access time (20 ns) and, on a miss (probability 1-h), paying three levels of PTE accesses (each 100 ns). Hence, avg_translation_time = 20 + (1 - 0.60) * 3 * 100 = 140 ns, which is under the required 150 ns. 5) Overhead for Device A (150 MB): we have 150 MB / 4 KB = 38,400 data pages. Each three-level leaf table covers 1024 entries, so we need 38 L3 tables, each requiring two physical pages → 76 pages total for L3. We then need one L2 page for those 38 L3 tables, and one L1 page.

Attempt 5:
reasoning='1) We keep the 4\u202fKB page size (2^12 bytes) because it offers a relatively high TLB hit rate. Using the formula h(page_size)=exp(-0.1542×(page_size/1024−5.82)²), substituting page_size=4096 yields h≈0.5996. 2) We have 40-bit virtual addresses (12 offset bits + 28 index bits). A three-level scheme with index-bit splits of [9, 9, 10] is chosen, meaning levels L1 and L2 each hold 512 entries, and L3 holds 1024 entries (requiring 2 physical pages for each L3 table). 3) For Device\u202fA (150\u202fMB mapped): 150\u202fMB ÷4\u202fKB=38,400 data pages. Each L3 table can map 1024 data pages, so we need 38 L3 tables (rounding up from 37.5)×2 physical pages each=76 pages just for L3. One L2 page (512 entries) covers all 38 L3 tables, and one L1 page addresses the single L2. The total is 78 pages×4096\u202fB=319,488\u202fB, under 320\u202fKB. 4) For Device\u202fB (2\u202fGB mapped): 2\u202fGB ÷4\u202fKB=524,288 data pages, needing 524,288÷1024=512 L3 tables.

On a miss (probability 1−0.5996=0.4004), we pay 3 levels of page‑table lookups at 100\u202fns each=300\u202fns.

Specifically, for 4096 bytes:\n   (4096 / 1024) = 4,  (4 - 5.82) = -1.82,  squared ≈ 3.3124,  multiplied by 0.1542 ≈ 0.5103,  so h ≈ e^(-0.5103) ≈ 0.60.\n2) We have 40-bit virtual addresses ⇒ 12 offset bits + 28 index bits. A three-level structure can use 9, 9, and 10 bits per level, giving 512, 512, and 1024 entries in each level, respectively. Since each PTE is 8 bytes and each table page is 4 KB, leaf tables with 1024 entries require 2 physical pages per leaf.\n3) For Device A (150 MB mapped): 150 MB / 4 KB = 38,400 data pages. Each leaf table covers 1024 data pages, so we need 38 leaf tables → 38 × 2 = 76 physical pages. One L2 page covers those 38 leaf tables, plus one L1 page covers the single L2, thus 78 total page-table pages. 78 × 4096 = 319,488 bytes page-table overhead, under 320 KB.\n4) For Device B (2 GB mapped): 2 GB / 4 KB = 524,288 data pages.

One L2 page and one L1 page handle those 512 tables, giving 1026 total page-table pages. 1026 × 4096 = 4,202,496 bytes, under 4.05 MB.\n5) Average translation time: On every access, we pay TLB access (20 ns). With hit probability ≈ 0.60, we only pay 20 ns if it hits. On a miss (0.40 probability), we pay 20 ns + 3 levels × 100 ns = 320 ns. So avg_translation_time ≈ (0.60 × 20) + (0.40 × 320) = 12 + 128 = 140 ns. Using a slightly more precise TLB hit rate near 0.5997 yields about 140.1 ns.

Splitting these 28 bits across three levels with 9, 9, and 10 bits means: L1 has 512 entries, L2 has 512 entries, and L3 has 1024 entries.

Multiplying by 4096 bytes gives 319,488 bytes. 3) For Device B (2 GB): we need 524,288 data pages (2 GB / 4 KB). Each L3 table covers 1024 pages, so we need 512 L3 tables, each 2 pages, total 1024 pages, plus 1 L2 and 1 L1, for 1026 total. Therefore 1026 × 4096 = 4,202,496 bytes. 4) The TLB hit rate is h = exp(-0.1542 × ((4096/1024) - 5.82)²). Numerically, (4 - 5.82)² = 3.3124, 0.1542 × 3.3124 ≈ 0.51031608, exp(-0.51031608) ≈ 0.6007. Then the average translation time is TLB access (20 ns) + (1 - h) × 3 × PTE access (3 × 100 ns), i.e. 20 + 0.3993 × 300 ≈ 139.79 ns, which meets the ≤ 150 ns requirement for both devices.' config=ConfigFile(DeviceA=DeviceConfig(page_size=4096, levels=3, entries_per_level=[512, 512, 1024], page_table_memory=319488, avg_translation_time=139.79), DeviceB=DeviceConfig(page_size=4096, levels=3, entries_per_level=[512, 512, 1024], page_table_memory=4202496, avg_translation_time=139.79))
