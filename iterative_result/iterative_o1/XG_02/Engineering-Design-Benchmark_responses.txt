Attempt 1:
reasoning='To meet the target bandwidth (~85 Hz), gain margin (>1.5 dB), and phase margin (>60°), we applied a loop-shaping strategy that first ensures adequate low-frequency gain (through an integrator for zero steady-state error) and then adds a lead term to improve phase margin. We selected a controller of the form C(s) = 2000 * (s + 500) / [ s (s + 2000) ]. The integrator boosts low-frequency gain, the zero at s = -500 partially compensates phase lag, and the pole at s = -2000 limits high-frequency gain. The overall gain of 2000 was chosen to set the desired closed-loop bandwidth around 85 Hz with acceptable gain and phase margins when tested against the plant dynamics.' config=ConfigFile(num=[2000.0, 1000000.0], den=[1.0, 2000.0, 0.0])
Attempt 2:
reasoning="In the previous attempt, the controller's overall gain was too high and introduced excessive open-loop gain at high frequencies, causing the bandwidth and margins to be unsatisfactory. To address this, we reduced the high-frequency gain and carefully placed a zero and pole to shape the loop and achieve the desired closed-loop bandwidth (~85 Hz), as well as preserve acceptable gain and phase margins. Specifically, we use an integrator for zero steady-state error, place a zero at 400 rad/s to boost the phase near the bandwidth, and place a pole at 2000 rad/s to attenuate high-frequency gain and ensure stability margins. The final gain (1200) was selected to achieve the targeted bandwidth and margins.

Attempt 3:
reasoning='In the previous attempts, the loop was shaped such that the open-loop gain remained too high at higher frequencies, causing the system’s gain crossover to fall to an extremely high frequency and effectively yield infinite bandwidth in the analysis. To address this, we introduce an integrator for zero steady-state error, place a zero at 314 rad/s to boost the phase near the desired crossover (around 2π·85 ≈ 534 rad/s), and place a pole at 3141 rad/s to roll off the gain more aggressively at high frequency. We then choose a gain of 500 such that the open-loop crosses unity gain near the target bandwidth. This design aims to achieve the ≈85 Hz closed-loop bandwidth while also preserving adequate stability margins. The resulting controller transfer function is C(s) = 500 × (s+314) / [ s × (s+3141) ].' config=ConfigFile(num=[500.0, 157000.0], den=[1.0, 3141.0, 0.0])
Attempt 4:
reasoning='In the previous design (Attempt 3), the controller had a good phase margin but produced a closed-loop bandwidth around 4.68 Hz, which is much lower than the desired ~85 Hz. To address this, we retain the integrator for zero steady-state error and keep the zero and high-frequency pole at 314 rad/s and 3141 rad/s, respectively, to provide sufficient phase boost and roll-off. However, we significantly increase the overall controller gain from 500 to 9000. This higher gain pushes the open-loop unity crossover frequency closer to 85 Hz while still maintaining adequate phase margin above 60° and a gain margin above 1.5 dB. The resulting controller is C(s) = 9000 × (s + 314) / [ s × (s + 3141) ].' config=ConfigFile(num=[9000.0, 2826000.0], den=[1.0, 3141.0, 0.0])
Attempt 5:
reasoning='In the previous attempts, using the zero at 314 rad/s and pole at 3141 rad/s gave either a very low closed-loop bandwidth (~4.7 Hz for a gain of 500) or resulted in infinite bandwidth (for a gain of 9000). This indicates that the crossover frequency quickly jumps from below our range to a very high frequency. To better center the desired unity-gain crossover at ~85 Hz, we shift the zero and pole slightly higher (to 350 and 3500 rad/s, respectively) to provide appropriate phase boost and more conservative high-frequency attenuation. We then select a controller gain of 6000 in hopes of achieving the specified ~85 Hz bandwidth and maintaining the required gain margin (>1.5 dB) and phase margin (>60°). The final controller is C(s) = 6000·(s+350) / [ s·(s+3500) ].' config=ConfigFile(num=[6000.0, 2100000.0], den=[1.0, 3500.0, 0.0])
Attempt 6:
reasoning='Based on the previous attempts and their feedback, the large jump between very low and very high bandwidth suggests that a single real zero and pole plus an integrator is insufficient for shaping the loop precisely around the ~85 Hz target. Instead, adding another pole at a higher frequency reduces high-frequency gain more aggressively. Therefore, we incorporate an integrator (for zero steady-state error), a real zero at 314 rad/s (to boost phase near the desired crossover region), and two real poles at 3141 rad/s and 18850 rad/s. A gain of 3000 attempts to set the unity-gain crossover near 85 Hz while preserving a phase margin above 60° and a gain margin above 1.5 dB.

Attempt 7:
reasoning='In the previous attempts, the open-loop crossover frequency either fell too low (a few Hz) or jumped to a very high value, leading to infinite bandwidth. This indicates that a single real zero and integrator (or even adding one extra pole) did not provide enough flexibility to precisely shape the open-loop Bode plot around the ~85 Hz region. To cope with the strong resonant dynamics of the plant, we use a two-lead structure plus an integrator, resulting in a controller of the form C(s) = K * (s + z1)(s + z2) / [ s * (s + p1)(s + p2) ].\n\nHere, we choose:\n• Integrator at s = 0 for zero steady-state error.\n• Two real zeros at z1 = 200 rad/s and z2 = 700 rad/s to boost the phase near the desired crossover region around 2π×85 ≈ 534 rad/s.\n• Two real poles at p1 = 2000 rad/s and p2 = 5000 rad/s to limit high-frequency gain.\n• A gain K = 100000 to bring the open-loop unity crossover closer to 85 Hz, preserving sufficient phase to achieve a phase margin above 60° and a gain margin above 1.5 dB.\n\nThis combination of two leads and two poles (plus the integrator) provides additional flexibility over previous single-lead designs, allowing more precise shaping of the open-loop Bode plot near the target 85 Hz bandwidth.

Attempt 8:
reasoning='From the previous attempts and their feedback, many designs either had the loop crossover frequency too low (a few Hz) or jumped to a very high crossing leading to infinite bandwidth. This indicates we need finer control of the open-loop shape. We therefore propose a two-lead (two real zeros) plus integrator design, along with two real poles at higher frequencies to limit high-frequency gain, and a moderate overall gain so that the open-loop crosses unity near 85 Hz.\n\nSpecifically, we place:\n\n• An integrator at s=0 for zero steady-state error.\n• Real zeros at 200 rad/s and 700 rad/s to add phase boost near the desired crossover around 2π·85≈534 rad/s.\n• Poles at 1500 rad/s and 5000 rad/s to roll off the open-loop gain at high frequencies.\n• An overall gain K=25000 to set the unity crossover near 85 Hz.\n\nThis approach offers more precise shaping of the open-loop Bode plot, aiming to achieve the target bandwidth around 85 Hz and maintain a phase margin above 60 degrees and a gain margin above 1.5 dB.' config=ConfigFile(num=[25000.0, 22500000.0, 3500000000.0], den=[1.0, 6500.0, 7500000.0, 0.0])
Attempt 9:
reasoning='In the previous attempts, either the loop crossover fell well below the desired 85 Hz or it jumped to a very high frequency, leading effectively to an infinite bandwidth in the analysis. This behavior suggests that a single lead (or even two leads) plus integrator, with one or two poles, has not been sufficient to shape the open-loop Bode plot precisely around 85 Hz—especially given the multiple resonances in the seventh-order plant. To gain more flexibility, we use two real zeros (for phase boost in the crossover region), two real poles (for roll-off at higher frequencies), and an integrator for zero steady-state error.\n\nIn this new design, we:\n1. Include an integrator at s = 0 (to ensure zero steady-state error);\n2. Place two real zeros at 400 rad/s and 600 rad/s to provide substantial phase boost around the desired crossover frequency of about 2π×85 ≈ 534 rad/s;\n3. Place two real poles at 3000 rad/s and 8000 rad/s to roll off the open-loop gain at higher frequencies, preventing the loop from experiencing excessively high crossover frequencies;\n4.

Attempt 10:
reasoning='In previous attempts, single- or two-lead + integrator controllers tended either to push the loop crossover frequency too low (a few Hz) or to jump above the analyzed frequency range, showing effectively infinite bandwidth. This behavior suggests that a more moderate gain, combined with carefully placed zero and multiple poles for high-frequency roll-off, might be needed. Here, we propose a single real zero at 314 rad/s, an integrator for zero steady-state error, and two real poles at 3141 rad/s and 6283 rad/s. The zero at 314 rad/s boosts phase around the 50–85 Hz region, while the poles at 3141 and 6283 rad/s limit high-frequency gain.
