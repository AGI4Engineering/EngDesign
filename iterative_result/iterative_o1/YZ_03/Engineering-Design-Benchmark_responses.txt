Attempt 1:
reasoning='Task 1: The relative bandwidth is computed as (f2 - f1)/f_center = (2.0 - 1.3)/1.65 ≈ 0.424, which is indeed less than 1. Task 2: Choose r < 0.0005 and 0.05 < D < 0.06. We pick D = 0.055 and r = 0.0004 to satisfy r < D/(20 * π). Next, we set the pitch to 8 deg (>5 deg), side length to 0.35 (>0.3), and specify 6 turns. These chosen parameters are suitable to achieve the needed directivity (~13 dBi within ±1.5 dBi) and axial ratio (<1.5).' relativeBW=0.424 r=0.0004 D=0.055 turns=6.0 pitch=8.0 side=0.35
Attempt 2:
reasoning='Task 1: The relative bandwidth is computed as (2.0 − 1.3) / 1.65 = 0.424(…)<1.\n\nTask 2: To address directivity and axial ratio issues observed previously, we increase the number of turns and adjust the pitch angle so the helix is closer to an axial-mode design at 1.65 GHz, with a circumference near 1 wavelength. We set D=0.058 (circumference≈1λ), pitch=12 deg (>5 deg), and turns=8. We keep r=0.0004 (<0.0005 and also <D/(20π)). The ground plane side is made larger (side=0.4) to help with gain. These parameters are expected to produce directivity around ~13 dBi (within ±1.5 dBi) across 1.3–2 GHz, and an axial ratio below 1.5 at center frequency.' relativeBW=0.424 r=0.0004 D=0.058 turns=8.0 pitch=12.0 side=0.4
Attempt 3:
reasoning='Task 1: The relative bandwidth is (2.0 GHz - 1.3 GHz) / 1.65 GHz = 0.424, which is less than 1. For Task 2, we first keep r < 0.0005 as required and also ensure that r < D / (20 * π). We choose D = 0.058 m, which approximates one wavelength circumference at 1.65 GHz, supporting axial-mode operation. To increase directivity around 13 dBi across the band, we increase the number of turns (turns = 10) and choose a pitch (pitch = 14°) that helps maintain circular polarization over the wide bandwidth. Finally, we pick side = 0.40 m as a sufficiently large ground plane. These parameters are designed to meet the directivity range of 13 dBi ± 1.5 dBi while keeping the axial ratio below 1.5 dB at the center frequency.' relativeBW=0.424 r=0.0004 D=0.058 turns=10.0 pitch=14.0 side=0.4
Attempt 4:
reasoning='Task 1: The relative bandwidth is computed as (2.0 − 1.3)/1.65 ≈ 0.424, which satisfies the condition of being < 1. Task 2: To address both directivity and axial ratio requirements, we keep the radius r at 0.0004 (< 0.0005), ensuring r < D / (20 × π). We choose a diameter D of 0.055 m (close to a suitable one-wavelength circumference at 1.65 GHz), use six turns, and increase the pitch angle to 12° to improve the axial ratio below 1.5. We also enlarge the ground plane side to 0.45 m to achieve the needed directivity within 13 dBi ± 1.5 dBi across the 1.3 − 2.0 GHz band.' relativeBW=0.424 r=0.0004 D=0.055 turns=6.0 pitch=12.0 side=0.45
Attempt 5:
reasoning='Task 1: The relative bandwidth is (2.0 GHz - 1.3 GHz) / 1.65 GHz = 0.424, which is less than 1, so we meet that requirement.\n\nTask 2: From prior attempts, we saw that smaller pitch angles tended to yield poor axial ratios, while larger pitch angles improve axial ratio but can reduce directivity at the center frequency. Similarly, using too many turns also unexpectedly reduced the center-frequency directivity. A balanced choice here is to pick a moderate pitch angle and an intermediate number of turns, while keeping the diameter near one wavelength circumference at 1.65 GHz and ensuring r < 0.0005 and r < D/(20π). We also reduce the ground-plane side from excessively large values that previously lowered the center-frequency directivity.\n\nThe chosen parameters are:\n• Relative bandwidth: 0.424\n• r = 0.0004 (less than 0.0005, also < D/(20π))\n• D = 0.055 (approximately one-wavelength circumference at 1.65 GHz)\n• turns = 7 (to boost directivity in axial mode)\n• pitch = 10° (>5°)\n• side = 0.35 (>0.3)\n\nThese values should maintain a directivity level around 11.5–12.5 dBi across the band (close to the 13 ± 1.5 dBi target) and keep the axial ratio below 1.5 at the center frequency.' relativeBW=0.424 r=0.0004 D=0.055 turns=7.0 pitch=10.0 side=0.35
