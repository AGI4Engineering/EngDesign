Attempt 1:
reasoning='1) We factor the operator across m, k, n with F_op = [2, 8, 16], so each core handles a sub-operator of shape 64×640×960 (m×k×n). 2) This yields 256 total sub-operators, which is under the 1,472-core limit. 3) We next ensure each core’s local memory can hold its sub-tensors. A = 64×640 (≈80 KB), C = 64×960 (≈120 KB), and B is further split by a factor of 4 on k, so each partial B = 160×960 (≈300 KB). The sum (~500 KB) fits within 624 KB. 4) For temporal partition factors: A’s dimension m and k are not split further (both 1), B’s k dimension is 4, n is 1, and C’s m, n are both 1. 5) Size alignment constraints on k are met since f_t_B_k=4 is a multiple of f_t_A_k=1, satisfying T10’s alignment requirement. This yields a valid schedule with feasible memory usage and minimal overheads.' config=ConfigFile(F_op=[2, 8, 16], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=1, f_t_B_k=4, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)
Attempt 2:
reasoning="1) To satisfy the 1472-core limit, we chose a 4×32×8 partition along (m, k, n), yielding 4×32×8=1024 sub-operators. Each sub-operator thus processes a sub-block of shape (32,160,1920), which are multiples of the 16×16 systolic array size and require no padding. 2) Storing partial A(32×160) ~10KB, partial B(160×1920) ~600KB, and partial C(32×1920) ~120KB exceeds the per-core 624KB. 3) To reduce memory usage, we introduce f_t_B_n=2 to temporally split B's n dimension in half, so each partial B(160×960) is ~300KB, and partial C(32×960) ~60KB, plus ~10KB for A fits safely within 624KB. 4) Other temporal factors are set to 1, ensuring alignment constraints. f_t_C_n=1 is a factor of f_t_B_n=2, so B and C's n-rotations remain consistent for compute-shift. This plan uses 1024 cores (<=1472), fits memory limits, and aligns well with 16×16 systolic arrays." config=ConfigFile(F_op=[4, 32, 8], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=1, f_t_B_k=1, f_t_B_n=2, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)
