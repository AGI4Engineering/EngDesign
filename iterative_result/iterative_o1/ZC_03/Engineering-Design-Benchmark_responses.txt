Attempt 2:
reasoning='We want to split our T = K·L rounds into a uniform exploration phase (length x = K^α L^β) and an exploitation phase (length T − x) using UCB. The cumulative regret Rₜ from exploration is roughly x (since uniform exploration for x steps may not always pick the best arm), and the regret from exploitation is on the order of √(K (T − x)). Thus, a high-level bound for the regret is Rₜ ≈ x + √(K (T − x)). Meanwhile, after x rounds of uniform exploration, each arm is pulled about x/K times, so the ATE estimation error scales like 1/√(x/K) = √(K/x). Our objective is J = E[√(Rₜ)] · E[Δ̂ₜ]. Substituting Rₜ and Δ̂ₜ with the above scalings, one finds that x should grow (asymptotically in T) on the order of √(T) to balance the two terms. Since T = K·L, setting x = √(K·L) exactly corresponds to α = 1/2 and β = 1/2. In that case, the resulting performance for J is asymptotically minimized, and no better scaling rules for x improve the order of J. Therefore, the sharp (upper and lower) bounds on α and β both coincide at 1/2.' config=ConfigFile(bar_alpha=0.5, under_linealpha=0.5, bar_beta=0.5, under_linebeta=0.5)

reasoning='We revisit the objective J = E[√(R_T)] · E[Δ̂_T], where R_T is the cumulative regret and Δ̂_T is the maximum ATE estimation error. The two-phase procedure allocates an initial uniform exploration phase of length x = K^α L^β rounds and uses these samples to form reliable reward estimates. Then, for the remaining T - x rounds, the learner runs a UCB-type algorithm to minimize regret.\n\n1) Regret analysis:\n   • During uniform exploration of length x, each arm is pulled about x/K times. The regret over these x rounds scales roughly linearly in x, as uniform exploration does not always pick the best arm.\n   • For the exploitation phase (T - x rounds), the UCB algorithm ensures a regret contribution on the order of √(K (T - x)), ignoring lower-order and logarithmic factors.\n   • Combining these, a simplified regret outline is: R_T ≈ x + √(K (T - x)).\n\n2) ATE estimation analysis:\n   • After x uniform pulls, each arm is acquired x/K times on average. A standard sub-Gaussian confidence bound argument indicates the estimation error for each arm’s mean scales with 1/√(x/K) ≈ √(K / x).\n   • Consequently, the maximum ATE estimation error over pairs of arms scales as Δ̂_T ≈ √(K / x).\n\n3) Putting them together:\n   • Our overall objective is J ≈ E[√(R_T)] · E[Δ̂_T]. Substituting in the scalings, we get an approximate measure: J ≈ √(x + √(K (T - x))) · √(K / x). Balancing this expression by setting x to be on the same order as √(T) (since T = K·L) yields x on the order of √(K·L). This translates to α = 1/2 and β = 1/2, ensuring that uniform exploration does not last too long (which would increase regret) and is not too short (which would degrade ATE estimation accuracy).\n\n4) Conclusion:\n   • This analysis suggests that the best asymptotic order is achieved by setting K^α L^β ≈ √(K L). Both the upper and lower bounds on α and β match at 1/2. Therefore, the recommended choice is bar_alpha = underline_alpha = 0.5 and bar_beta = underline_beta = 0.5.\n' config=ConfigFile(bar_alpha=0.5, under_linealpha=0.5, bar_beta=0.5, under_linebeta=0.5)
Attempt 4:
reasoning='We aim to balance the trade-off between achieving a low cumulative regret (ensuring high rewards) and obtaining accurate ATE estimates (ensuring reliable comparisons among arms). In a two-phase algorithm—consisting of a brief uniform exploration followed by a UCB-based exploitation—let the duration of uniform exploration be x = K^α L^β. If x is too large, then regret is unnecessarily high due to suboptimal exploration for too many rounds; if x is too small, then ATE estimation reliability suffers, increasing Δ̂ₜ. Balancing these two costs reveals that setting x on the order of √(K·L) (i.e., α = 1/2 and β = 1/2) minimizes J = E[√(Rₜ)] · E[Δ̂ₜ]. A longer exploration does not further improve ATE estimates in a way that significantly reduces J, and a shorter exploration disproportionately inflates ATE errors.

reasoning='After reconsidering the previous attempts and the feedback, the consensus remains that setting the length of the uniform exploration phase on the order of √(K·L) (i.e., K^α L^β = √(K·L)) provides the best asymptotic trade-off between cumulative regret and maximum ATE estimation error. Specifically, devoting roughly √(K·L) rounds to uniform exploration offers sufficiently precise ATE estimates (reducing Δ̂ₜ) without unduly inflating regret (which then scales well with a UCB-style policy).

reasoning='Upon balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in a two-phase algorithm—uniform exploration for K^α L^β steps, followed by UCB-based exploitation—the key is to choose α and β to simultaneously keep regret and ATE estimation error small. If the exploration phase is too short, the ATE estimates become inaccurate; if it is too long, the regret increases unnecessarily. Viewing T = K·L, standard analyses of bandit regret (for UCB) and confidence intervals for mean estimates suggest that scaling the exploration phase as √(K·L) is optimal. Concretely, setting K^α L^β = √(K·L) yields α = β = 0.5.

Attempt 9:
reasoning='Building on the analysis of the two-phase algorithm, we consider that in the exploration phase we need enough uniform samples to estimate each arm’s mean accurately, thus keeping the maximum ATE estimation error small. On the other hand, if we explore too long, the cumulative regret increases unnecessarily. By letting the duration of uniform exploration scale as x = K^α L^β, we balance these two concerns.\n\n1) Regret considerations: During exploration, each arm is chosen equally, contributing a linear term in x (since exploration is not guided by immediate reward). In the subsequent exploitation phase, a standard UCB approach adds roughly √(K (T − x)) regret. Combining these yields R_T ≈ x + √(K (T − x)).\n\n2) ATE estimation considerations: After x uniform exploration rounds, each arm is sampled x/K times. Statistical concentration arguments show that the error in each arm’s mean estimate behaves like 1/√(x/K), so the maximum ATE error across all arm pairs scales as √(K/x).\n\n3) Objective J: Our ultimate goal is to minimize J = E[√(R_T)] · E[Δ̂_T]. Substituting the rough forms for R_T and Δ̂_T suggests that x should be proportional to √(T), where T = K·L. This choice keeps both √(R_T) and √(K/x) at balanced magnitudes, preventing either term from dominating.\n\nHence the best asymptotic order is achieved by choosing x = K^(1/2) L^(1/2).

reasoning='We can confirm from the bandit literature and standard exploration–exploitation trade-off arguments that allocating O(√(K∙L)) rounds to uniform exploration—which translates to K^α L^β = √(K L), i.e., α = β = 0.5—continues to be the optimal strategy for balancing minimal cumulative regret with accurate ATE estimates. In other words, shorter exploration yields poor estimates of each arm’s mean, inflating the ATE estimation error, whereas longer exploration leads to unnecessarily large regret. Therefore, the correct scaling for the initial uniform exploration phase is indeed proportional to √(K L), and setting α = β = 0.5 is the only choice (both upper and lower bound) that simultaneously mitigates regret and preserves estimation accuracy, thereby minimizing the product J = E[√(R_T)] · E[Δ̂_T].' config=ConfigFile(bar_alpha=0.5, under_linealpha=0.5, bar_beta=0.5, under_linebeta=0.5)
