Attempt 1:
reasoning='1) We see that Degree0 has a checkerboard pattern, meaning every other pixel is missing (zero). To fill those missing pixels in a way that approximates linear interpolation, we can convolve multiple times or iteratively with a small kernel that blends in neighboring pixel values. 2) We design a 3Ã—3 kernel whose center cell is 1, plus weights on its four direct neighbors, so that the missing pixels are nudged toward the average of their neighbors. Although this kernel sums to more than 1, applying it iteratively (with appropriate handling of zeros vs. non-zeros) helps fill in black gaps smoothly and preserves meaningful intensity for the known pixels. 3) This approach ensures that AoLP and DoLP, which rely on the underlying intensity structure, remain consistent after inpainting the corrupted data. Below is a simple example kernel to achieve this filling behavior.' config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.0, 0.25, 0.0], [0.25, 1.0, 0.25], [0.0, 0.25, 0.0]])
