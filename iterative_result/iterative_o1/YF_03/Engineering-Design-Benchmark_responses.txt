Attempt 1:
reasoning='To ensure the maximum deflection remains below 2 mm for a 1 m cantilever beam (loaded over its outer half), the thickness needs to provide sufficient bending stiffness. Approximating the load as 1000 N at the centroid (750 mm from the fixed end) and using an elementary beam deflection formula suggests that a thickness of around 50 mm achieves a deflection of about 1.6 mm, which falls within 70â€“90% of the 2 mm limit. This thickness should meet both strength and serviceability requirements while optimizing the displacement ratio to maximize the scoring criteria.' config=ConfigFile(Th=50.0)
Attempt 2:
reasoning='Previously, a 50 mm thickness led to a 2.434 mm deflection, which exceeded the 2 mm threshold. Because beam deflection scales inversely with the cube of thickness, increasing thickness is the most direct way to reduce displacement. Raising the thickness from 50 mm to 58 mm represents about a 16% increase in dimension; since deflection scales roughly with 1/(Th^3), this should reduce displacement by more than 20%, bringing it below 2 mm. At this level, the resulting deflection would likely fall between 70% and 90% of the allowed 2 mm, meeting the scoring criteria while remaining structurally efficient.' config=ConfigFile(Th=58.0)
