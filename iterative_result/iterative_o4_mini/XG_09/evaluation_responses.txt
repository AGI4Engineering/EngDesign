reasoning='We need to tighten the definition of “no‐edge” in the gradient domain (Ix,Iy) so that only sufficiently large intensity differences trigger a black (edge) membership, and conversely widen the spans of the output triangular membership functions so that the system can clearly distinguish white (background) from black (edge).  \n\n1. Gaussian sigmas (sx,sy):  \n   • Baseline 0.01 yields an extremely narrow “zero” region, leading to noise and spurious edges.  \n   • Increasing to 0.05 enlarges the fuzzy “no‐edge” band, suppressing small variations due to texture or shading.  \n\n2. Output trimf for Iout:  \n   • White MF [wa,wb,wc]=[0,0.2,0.4]:  any output degree below about 0.4 is interpreted as background (white), sharpening the decision boundary.  \n   • Black MF [ba,bb,bc]=[0.6,0.8,1.0]:  only outputs above 0.6 are considered strong edges.  \n\nWith these settings, small gradients are treated as nonedges and only robust boundaries persist, which reduces MSE, raises PSNR and increases SSIM against the Canny pseudo‐ground truth.' config=ConfigFile(sx=0.05, sy=0.05, wa=0.0, wb=0.2, wc=0.4, ba=0.6, bb=0.8, bc=1.0)
Attempt 2:
reasoning='To boost SSIM while keeping MSE < 0.5 and PSNR > 3\u2009dB, we need a slightly tighter zero‐gradient zone (so we admit weaker edges), and broader, more overlapped output MFs (so the crispness of ‘white’ vs. ‘black’ matches the Canny map more smoothly).  \n\n1. Reduce Gaussian spreads from 0.05→0.03:  sx=sy=0.03  \n   – This still suppresses trivial texture noise, but admits more genuine mid‐level gradients.  \n\n2. Widen and shift the white (background) MF to cover 0→0.6, and have black (edge) MF start at 0.5→1.0:  \n   • white trimf=[wa,wb,wc]=[0.0,0.3,0.6]  \n   • black trimf=[ba,bb,bc]=[0.5,0.8,1.0]  \n\nWith these settings, the system produces a smoother transition in the overlap region [0.5–0.6], which better aligns with Canny’s edge confidence.

Attempt 3:
reasoning='The persistent negative SSIM tells us our fuzzy output still structurally misaligns with the binary Canny map. To force a crisp, binary output that matches Canny edges exactly, we must make the “white” membership map collapse to 0 and the “black” map collapse to 1.

This narrows the “zero” Ix/Iy band and admits only truly flat neighbors as background.\n2. Redefine the Iout triangular MFs as follows:\n   • white MF = trimf([0, 0, 0.5]) → always yields 0 for background.\n   • black MF = trimf([0.5, 1, 1]) → always yields 1 for edges.\n\nWith these settings, the FIS output is forced to 0 or 1, aligning exactly with Canny’s binary map.

Attempt 4:
reasoning='The persistent negative SSIM indicates that our crisp, almost binary outputs still structurally misalign with the Canny map—our edges are either too thin or too thick compared to the pseudo‐ground truth. To improve SSIM, we need a “soft” overlap in the Iout MFs so that edge regions in the FIS output more closely mimic the gradual transition in the Canny edge map. At the same time, we still want a narrow zero‐gradient band so only true edges trigger a strong response.\n\n1. Tighten the zero‐gradient Gaussians slightly (sx=sy=0.015).  This suppresses spurious noise but admits true edges.  \n2.

Attempt 5:
reasoning='The persistent negative SSIM indicates that, although our MSE and PSNR are now acceptable, the fuzzy edges are still too crisp and mis‐aligned with Canny’s soft, thick boundaries.

Increase the Gaussian spreads (sx, sy) to admit a wider band of mid‐level gradients around each true edge.  This thickens and smoothes the detected boundaries instead of producing a razor‐thin line.  We move from σ≈0.015 up to σ≈0.08.\n\n2. Dramatically widen and overlap the two triangular MFs for Iout so that values in the 0.2–0.8 range receive strong degrees in both “white” and “black.”  This creates a soft, fuzzy transition zone around each edge:\n   • white MF = trimf([0.0, 0.2, 0.8])\n   • black MF = trimf([0.2, 0.8, 1.0])\n\nBy thickening the gradient band and giving a large overlap in the 0.2–0.8 region, the FIS output now mimics the multi‐pixel edge zones of Canny.

Attempt 8:
reasoning='After seven trials, SSIM remains negative because our FIS never produces true 0–1 binary outputs: the defuzzified intensity of “white” and “black” always falls in the mid‐range (e.g. 0.3/0.7), so it structurally misaligns with the Canny binary map. To force the FIS output into a crisp binary image that can match Canny’s 0/1 edge map—and land SSIM above 0.05—we do two things:\n\n1. Collapse the two output membership functions into degenerate trimfs at 0 and 1:\n   • white = trimf([0, 0, 0])  → always defuzzifies to 0 when that rule fires\n   • black = trimf([1, 1, 1])  → always defuzzifies to 1 when that rule fires\n\n2. Choose a moderate Gaussian σ for Ix and Iy so that “zero” really means “flat” ±0.04, thereby suppressing texture noise but still capturing true edges that Canny would detect:\n   • sx = sy = 0.04\n\nWith this configuration, the first rule (Ix≈0 and Iy≈0) produces output=0, and the second rule (Ix≠0 or Iy≠0 beyond ±0.04) produces output=1.

Attempt 9:
reasoning='In all previous attempts we either made the edges too crisp (σ very small) or too blurred (σ very large), and our output MFs never overlapped widely enough to reproduce Canny’s characteristic multi-pixel, softly thick edges.  To finally push SSIM above 0.05 while holding MSE<0.5 and PSNR>3 dB, we need:\n\n1. A moderate Gaussian spread for the zero‐gradient Gaussians: σx=σy=0.05.  This width is large enough to admit mid-level gradients around true edges—producing 2–3 pixel-wide fuzzy boundaries—but still small enough to suppress texture noise.\n\n2. Very broad, symmetric overlap in the Iout trimf definitions so that any defuzzified output in [0.2–0.8] has significant membership in both "white" and "black."  This creates a smooth transition zone exactly where Canny’s thick edges lie:\n   • white = trimf([0.0, 0.2, 0.8])\n   • black = trimf([0.2, 0.8, 1.0])\n\nWith these settings, small gradients inside flat regions still map to pure background, large gradients map to strong edges, and mid-strength gradients produce a two-pixel-wide fuzzy band that structurally matches the Canny map.

Attempt 10:
reasoning='After examining the repeated failures in SSIM—even when MSE and PSNR targets were met—I conclude that the key issue is structural misalignment: our fuzzy‐edge map never lines up with Canny’s crisp, binary boundaries.

Tighten the zero-gradient Gaussians to an extremely small σ: sx=sy=0.005.  This means only truly strong gradients (matching Canny’s threshold) fire the “edge” rule; everything else is treated as flat.\n\n2. Collapse the Iout MFs into two half-intervals with minimal overlap:\n   • White (background) trimf at [0.0, 0.1, 0.5]: outputs ≤0.5 map strongly to 0.\n   • Black (edge) trimf at [0.5, 0.9, 1.0]: outputs ≥0.5 map strongly to 1.\n\nWith these settings, evalfis will produce a binary output nearly identical in structure to the Canny edge map—suppressing noise and matching edge positions.
