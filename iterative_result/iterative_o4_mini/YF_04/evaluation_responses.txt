reasoning='1. We need to choose shaft diameter D so that the twist angle φ under T=1×10⁶ N·mm over L=1000 mm satisfies φ≤0.05 rad, and (φ/0.05) lies between 0.7–0.9 for full score.\n\n2. Material shear modulus G=E/[2(1+ν)]=210 000 MPa/(2.6)≈80 770 N/mm².\n\n3. For a solid circular shaft, φ=T\u2009L/(G\u2009J) with J=π\u2009D⁴/32. Setting φ=0.05 gives D_min≈40.0 mm.\n\n4. To target φ/0.05≈0.8 (mid‐range), solve (40/D)⁴=0.8 → D≈40/0.8^(1/4)≈42.4 mm.\n\n5. Rounding to a standard size and ensuring φ/0.05 ≥0.7, select D=44 mm. This yields (40/44)⁴≈0.714 → φ≈0.714·0.05≈0.0357 rad (≈71% of limit), i.e. within the 70–90% band for full credit and a safety margin against under-stiff designs.\n' config=ConfigFile(Th=44.0)
