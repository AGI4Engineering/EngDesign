reasoning='Task 1:\nWe need to choose a passband cutoff Fpass that fully covers the maximum LTE bandwidth of 10 MHz (±5 MHz around center) and leave a small guard margin for filter roll-off. A typical margin of 0.5 MHz gives:\n  Fpass = 5 MHz + 0.5 MHz = 5.5 MHz.\n\nThe stopband edge Fstop can be placed at the end of the transition band where we require full stopband attenuation. We must stay below the Nyquist rate of FsLTERx/2 = 30.72 MHz/2 = 15.36 MHz, but we don’t need to push right to Nyquist. Choosing Fstop = 7.5 MHz gives a large transition band (from 5.5 to 7.5 MHz) to achieve high attenuation.\n\nPassband ripple Ap in LTE RF chains is typically kept below 0.1 dB to avoid EVM degradation. We choose Ap = 0.1 dB. Stopband attenuation Ast must be large enough (at least 60 dB) to suppress out-of-band interferers; a design target of Ast = 80 dB is a common engineering tradeoff for digital filters.\n\nTask 2:\nWe must reduce FsADC = 150 MHz to FsLTERx = 30.72 MHz.
