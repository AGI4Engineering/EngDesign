Attempt 1:
reasoning='To resonate at 3 GHz in free space, the total dipole length should be close to half a wavelength: λ0= c/f ≈100 mm, so L≈λ0/2≈50 mm. A strip width of about 1/10 of the length (W≈5 mm) will provide sufficient bandwidth (>100 MHz) and meet the space constraint (≤100×100 mm). A thin copper dipole of L=50 mm and W=5 mm will typically exhibit S11≤–10 dB across a ≥100 MHz span around 3 GHz and deliver ≥2 dBi gain.' config=ConfigFile(length_mm=50.0, width_mm=5.0)
Attempt 2:
reasoning='The previous design (L=50 mm, W=5 mm) resonated too low (2.73 GHz) because real end effects shorten the electrical length. To shift resonance up to 3 GHz, we must reduce the physical length by the ratio 2.7348/3 ≈ 0.912. Thus: L_new ≈ 50 mm × 0.912 ≈ 45.6 mm. To maintain at most 1/10 width‐to‐length, choose W ≈ 0.1×45.6 mm ≈ 4.56 mm; we round to 4.5 mm for ease of fabrication. A 45.6 mm×4.5 mm copper strip dipole should then resonate at 3 GHz with S11 ≤ –10 dB, maintain ≥100 MHz bandwidth, and provide ≥2 dBi gain within the 100 mm×100 mm envelope.' config=ConfigFile(length_mm=45.6, width_mm=4.5)
Attempt 3:
reasoning='The previous design (L=45.6 mm, W=4.5 mm) resonated at 3.0372 GHz, about 37.2 MHz above the 3 GHz target. To shift the resonance down to 3 GHz, we scale the length by the ratio f_achieved/f_target = 3.0372/3 ≈ 1.0124. Thus: L_new ≈ 45.6 mm × 1.0124 ≈ 46.16 mm. Rounding to a practical fabrication value gives L=46.2 mm. Keeping the width at about 1/10 of the length yields W≈4.62 mm; we round to W=4.6 mm. This adjustment will lower the resonant frequency to ≈3 GHz, maintain S11≤–10 dB over ≥100 MHz bandwidth, achieve ≥2 dBi gain, and remain within the 100 × 100 mm envelope.' config=ConfigFile(length_mm=46.2, width_mm=4.6)
Attempt 4:
reasoning='In the previous design (L=46.2 mm, W=4.6 mm) the resonant frequency was slightly below 3 GHz (2.9928 GHz). To shift the resonance exactly to 3 GHz, we shorten the dipole by the ratio f_current/f_target = 2.9928/3 ≈ 0.9976. Thus the new length is L_new ≈ 46.2 mm × 0.9976 ≈ 46.1 mm. Keeping the width at about 1/10 of the length yields W ≈ 4.6 mm. This adjustment will place the resonance at 3 GHz with S11 well below –10 dB, maintain a bandwidth >100 MHz (≈436 MHz), achieve ≥2 dBi gain, and stay within the 100 mm × 100 mm envelope.' config=ConfigFile(length_mm=46.1, width_mm=4.6)
Attempt 5:
reasoning='The last design (L = 46.1 mm, W = 4.6 mm) produced a resonance at 2.9928 GHz, slightly below the 3 GHz target. To shift the resonant frequency up to exactly 3 GHz, we shorten the dipole by the ratio f_current/f_target = 2.9928 GHz / 3 GHz ≈ 0.9976. Applying this scaling to the length gives: L_new ≈ 46.1 mm × 0.9976 ≈ 45.99 mm, which we round to 46.0 mm for practical fabrication. We keep the width at about one‐tenth of the length to preserve bandwidth, W_new ≈ 0.1 × 46.0 mm = 4.6 mm. This configuration will place the resonance at 3 GHz with S11 ≤ –10 dB across >100 MHz, maintain ≥2 dBi gain, and fit within the 100 mm × 100 mm envelope.' config=ConfigFile(length_mm=46.0, width_mm=4.6)
Attempt 6:
reasoning='Based on the last two measured points:\n- L=46.0 mm → f₀=3.0072 GHz\n- L=46.2 mm → f₀=2.9928 GHz\nwe can linearly interpolate the required length to hit exactly 3.000 GHz. The frequency slope is Δf/ΔL≈(2.9928–3.0072)/(46.2–46.0)=–0.072 GHz/mm. To shift from 3.0072 down to 3.0000 GHz requires an increase in length by ΔL=–Δf/(Δf/ΔL)=0.0072/0.072≈0.1 mm. Hence the new dipole arm length is L=46.0 mm+0.1 mm=46.1 mm. Keeping the width at about one‐tenth of the length ensures the bandwidth remains wide (>100 MHz) and the gain ≥2 dBi, so we set W=4.6 mm. This design will resonate at 3.000 GHz with S11≤–10 dB, deliver ≥2 dBi gain, achieve ≥100 MHz bandwidth, and fit within the 100 mm×100 mm envelope.' config=ConfigFile(length_mm=46.1, width_mm=4.6)

reasoning='To hit exactly 3.000 GHz given our two previous measured points—\n  • L=45.99 mm → f₀=3.0072 GHz\n  • L=46.10 mm → f₀=2.9928 GHz\nwe compute the slope: Δf/ΔL = (2.9928–3.0072)/(46.10–45.99) = –0.0144 GHz/0.11 mm ≈ –0.131 GHz/mm. To shift from 3.0072 down to 3.0000 GHz (Δf=–0.0072 GHz), we need ΔL = Δf/(Δf/ΔL) = –0.0072/(–0.131) ≈ +0.055 mm. Adding this to 45.99 mm yields L ≈ 46.045 mm. Rounding to a practical fabrication precision gives L=46.05 mm. We keep the width at ~1/10 of the length (W≈4.605 mm) and round to W=4.6 mm to maintain ≥100 MHz bandwidth and ≥2 dBi gain.
