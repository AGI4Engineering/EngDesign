reasoning='1. I examined the input image array and noted that pixel values range roughly between  fifty‐odd up to two hundred or so, with smooth regions punctuated by clear intensity transitions.  \n2. To suppress high‐frequency noise before edge detection, I will apply a small Gaussian blur.  A 5×5 kernel with σ≈1.0 strikes a good balance between smoothing noise and preserving edge integrity, so I choose a Gaussian kernel size of 5.  \n3. For edge detection I select the classic 3×3 Sobel operators.  The x‐direction kernel (edge_x) highlights vertical edges and is:\n   [ [–1, 0, +1],\n     [–2, 0, +2],\n     [–1, 0, +1] ]\n   The y‐direction kernel (edge_y) is its transpose, highlighting horizontal edges:\n   [ [–1, –2, –1],\n     [ 0,  0,  0],\n     [+1, +2, +1] ]\n4. After convolution with these kernels, the gradient magnitude map will be computed.  To filter out very weak (noisy) gradients I set a minimum threshold of 20; gradients below 20 are discarded.  To avoid saturating on extremely large responses I cap at a maximum threshold of 200.  \n5. These choices (Gaussian size 5, Sobel 3×3 kernels, thresholds [20,200]) give a clean edge map that preserves significant edges while rejecting noise.' config=ConfigFile(gaussian=5.0, edge_x=[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]], edge_y=[[-1.0, -2.0, -1.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0, 1.0]], maximum=200.0, minimum=20.0)
