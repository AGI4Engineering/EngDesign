Express the total force F acting on that face as a function of thickness Th:\n   – Face 5 area = Height × Th = 50 mm × Th.\n   – F = σ · Area = 22.36 N/mm² × (50 mm·Th) = 1 118·Th N.\n3. Model the beam as a cantilever of length L = 50 mm, loaded by a uniform face traction. Approximate the equivalent single force applied at the mid‐height of the face:\n   – Equivalent lever arm = L/2 = 25 mm.\n   – Resulting bending moment at the fixed end: M = F · (L/2) = (1 118·Th) × 25 = 27 950·Th N·mm.\n4. Compute the area moment of inertia I of the cross‐section (height = 50 mm, width = Th):\n   – I = (b·h³)/12 = (50·Th³)/12 ≈ (50/12)·Th³ ≈ 4.1667·Th³ mm⁴.\n5. Use the constant–moment deflection formula for a cantilever (δ = M·L/(E·I)):\n   – δ = (27 950·Th × 50) / [21 000·(4.1667·Th³)] ≈ 15.97/Th² (mm).\n6. Impose the displacement requirement δ ≤ 0.1 mm:\n   – 15.97/Th² ≤ 0.1 → Th² ≥ 159.7 → Th ≥ 12.65 mm.\n7. Select a standard thickness just above this value, Th = 13 mm:\n   – Check δ ≈ 15.97/13² ≈ 0.095 mm (< 0.1 mm).' config=ConfigFile(Th=13.0)
