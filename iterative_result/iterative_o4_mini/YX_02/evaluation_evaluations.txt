Attempt 1:
{'detailed information': "Global input constraints in Task 1 are calculated correctly.\nSampling of global inputs gained from Task 2 satisfies constraints.\nThe sampling points of the global inputs gained from Task 2 satisfy the LHS sampling principle (LHS divides each variable's range into N intervals and ensures each sample uses a unique interval per dimension for uniform coverage).\nnormalized_speed_factor in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nP_range in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nG_range in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nThe sampling points of the local inputs gained from Task 4 satisfy the LHS sampling principle (LHS divides each variable's range into N intervals and ensures each sample uses a unique interval per dimension for uniform coverage).", 'total_score': 100}
