reasoning='1. The Degree0 array exhibits a perfect checkerboard of valid measurements and zeros. Each zero-valued pixel is surrounded in the four cardinal directions (N, S, E, W) by non-zero neighbors.  \n2. To recover the missing values we can apply a convolutional kernel that performs bilinear (linear in x and y) interpolation from the four adjacent neighbors.  In a 3×3 window centered at a zero position, only the center (the missing pixel) and its north/south/east/west neighbors participate.  \n3. We choose weights so that the center of the kernel is 1.0 (so that at known pixels the convolution leaves them unchanged), and each of the four neighbors contributes equally to the interpolation.  In normalized bilinear interpolation each neighbor would carry weight 0.25, but since our center must be 1.0 (not 0.0), we use the common 3×3 separable bilinear shape:  \n      [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]  \n      [0.5 , 1.0, 0.5 ]  \n      [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]  \n   The sum of weights is 4.0, so at a zero pixel the output is simply the average of its four neighbors (since only those have non-zero weight) and the center term contributes zero.  At a known pixel the 1.0 center weight preserves its original value while its immediate neighbors induce a small amount of smoothing.  \n4. This kernel thus mimics bilinear interpolation, has its center equal to 1, and can be used to fill the checkerboard zeros in Degree0.  We will later evaluate the resulting AoLP and DoLP images as a metric for interpolation quality.' config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.25, 0.5, 0.25], [0.5, 1.0, 0.5], [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]])
