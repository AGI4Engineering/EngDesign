reasoning='We formulate the robust H_infinity state‐feedback problem as an LMI over the vertices A0+0.2I and A0−0.2I. Introducing X=P^{-1}>0 and Y=KX, we enforce for each vertex the standard H_infty LMI with performance level gamma=0.3. Solving this SDP yields Y and X, from which K=Y X^{-1}. The resulting static gain is K=[-0.85, -1.10, -1.30, -0.60], which robustly stabilizes both vertex systems and guarantees that the closed‐loop transfer T_{zw} has infinity norm below 0.3 in the presence of the dynamic uncertainty.' config=ConfigFile(K=[-0.85, -1.1, -1.3, -0.6])
