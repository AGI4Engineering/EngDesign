Attempt 1:
reasoning='We need Th such that the max vertical deflection under the given load stays below 2 mm.  \n\nModel assumptions:  \n• Total downward force = pressure × loaded area = [1000/(500 mm×40 mm)]×(500×40) = 1000 N distributed over the outer half (x=500–1000 mm).  \n• Treat this as a uniformly distributed load q = 1000 N/500 mm = 2 N/mm along that half–span on a cantilever of length L=1000 mm.  \n• Beam’s moment of inertia about the strong axis: I = (w·Th^3)/12 = (40·Th^3)/12 ≈3.333·Th^3 mm^4.  \n• Cantilever deflection at free end under a partial uniform load over 0≤x≤a: δ = q·a^2·(6L^2–4La+a^2)/(24·E·I).  Plug in q=2 N/mm, a=500 mm, L=1000 mm, E=210 000 N/mm^2, I=3.333·Th^3 → δ≈126 500/Th^3 (mm).  \n• To limit δ≤2 mm ⇒126 500/Th^3≤2 ⇒Th^3≥63 250 ⇒Th≥cube_root(63 250)≈40 mm.  \n\nA bare 40 mm thickness would yield δ≈1.98 mm, close to the 2 mm limit. To stay comfortably below 2 mm and ensure a safety margin (and also fall in the 70–90% deflection range for full scoring), increasing Th slightly is prudent.  \n\nChoosing Th=44 mm yields I≈3.333·44^3≈283 600 mm^4 and δ≈126 500/44^3≈1.486 mm (≈0.743 of the 2 mm limit), giving robust stiffness and a full‐credit deflection ratio between 70% and 90%.' config=ConfigFile(Th=44.0)
Attempt 2:
reasoning='The previous choice (Th=44 mm) produced a max displacement of 3.57 mm (>2 mm). From that result, deflection scales roughly with 1/Th³. Using δ·Th³ ≃3.57·44³ ≃3.05×10^5, we set a target deflection of 1.6 mm (80% of the 2 mm limit for full‐credit). Solving Th³≃3.05×10^5/1.6 gives Th≃57.6 mm. Rounding to a standard size and providing a small safety margin, we select Th=56 mm, which yields an estimated δ≈1.74 mm (87% of limit). This meets the stiffness requirement and falls within the 70–90% deflection ratio for maximum score.' config=ConfigFile(Th=56.0)
