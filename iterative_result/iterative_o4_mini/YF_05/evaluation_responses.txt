Attempt 1:
reasoning='1. Geometry and supports:\n   - Node1 at (0,0) fully fixed in x and y.\n   - Node2 at (1000,0) pinned in y only (free in x).\n   - Node3 at (1000,1000) loaded with F=4000 N downward.\n   - Members: 1–2 horizontal (A=100 mm²), 1–3 diagonal (A=100 mm²), 2–3 vertical (A=Th, to be designed).\n2. Under a purely vertical load at Node 3, equilibrium at Node 3 requires the vertical member 2–3 to carry nearly all of the 4000 N (the diagonal has no net vertical contribution without a horizontal constraint at Node 3).  \n3. Approximate vertical deflection of the vertical member only:  \n   δ = F·L/(A·E)  \n   = (4000 N·1000 mm)/(Th mm²·210 000 N/mm²)  \n   = 4×10⁶/(210 000·Th)  \n   ≃ 19.05/Th  (mm)\n4. Enforce δ < 0.5 mm:  \n   19.05/Th < 0.5  ⇒  Th > 19.05/0.5 ≃ 38.1 mm²\n5. Choose a standard safety margin and round up to ensure stiffness and accommodate modelling uncertainties: Th = 50 mm².\n6. A = 50 mm² yields δ ≃ 19.05/50 ≃ 0.38 mm < 0.5 mm, satisfying the performance criterion with margin.' config=ConfigFile(Th=50.0)
Attempt 2:
reasoning='1. Review of previous design and FE feedback:\n   - With A₂₃=50 mm² the FE model reports max vertical displacement δ=0.5387 mm > 0.5 mm (disp_thresh).\n   - Displacement in a linear truss scales inversely with cross-sectional area (δ ∝ 1/A).\n\n2. Determine required area to meet δ≤0.5 mm:\n   - Let A_old=50 mm², δ_old=0.5387 mm, target δ_target=0.5 mm.\n   - A_new = A_old·(δ_old/δ_target) ≃ 50·(0.5387/0.5) ≃ 53.87 mm².\n\n3. Apply safety and manufacturing margin:\n   - Round up to a convenient standard size and include margin for modelling uncertainties.\n   - Choose A₂₃ = 60 mm².\n\n4. Verification of new design:\n   - Estimated δ_new ≃ δ_old·(A_old/A_new) ≃ 0.5387·(50/60) ≃ 0.449 mm (< 0.5 mm).\n   - Axial stress σ = 4000 N / 60 mm² ≃ 66.7 MPa, well below σ_lim = 250 MPa.\n\nConclusion: A reasonable, structurally sound choice for the vertical member area is 60 mm², satisfying both stiffness and strength requirements with margin.' config=ConfigFile(Th=60.0)
