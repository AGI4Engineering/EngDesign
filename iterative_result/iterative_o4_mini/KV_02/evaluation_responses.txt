Attempt 1:
reasoning='We need to pick four numerical parameters that safely and effectively drive the balancing relay logic for our 3-cell stack.  \n\n1. lowest_current:  \n   • This should be large enough to make measurable SOC adjustments over a reasonable time frame (hours) but small enough to avoid significant heating or cell stress.  \n   • For 2–3 Ah Li-ion cells, a few tens of milliamps is typical for fine balancing.  \n   • We choose 0.05 A (50 mA) as our lower‐limit balancing current.  \n\n2. highest_current:  \n   • Active switched‐capacitor balancing can safely push more current than passive bleed resistors, but to avoid cell voltage sag and PI‐loop instability we keep it below C/10.  \n   • For a 2 Ah cell, C/10 is 0.2 A. We choose 0.2 A as our upper limit.  \n\n3. on_threshold (SOC to stop charging/start discharging):  \n   • We want to prevent any cell from exceeding its safe operating window at the top end (4.1 V/CV cutoff).  \n   • In terms of SOC, we map that to about 0.80 (80%). Thus, when any cell’s SOC ≥0.80, we stop charging it and begin discharge balancing.  \n\n4. off_threshold (SOC to resume charging after discharge):  \n   • To introduce hysteresis and prevent rapid relay toggling, we wait until the cell has discharged below a slightly lower SOC.  \n   • We choose 0.75 (75%) as the resume‐charging point.  \n\nThese settings ensure measurable but gentle balancing currents, avoid over‐stress at the top of charge, and include a 5% SOC hysteresis band to reduce chatter.' config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.05, highest_current=0.2, on_threshold=0.8, off_threshold=0.75)
Attempt 2:
reasoning='To address the feedback and ensure a safer, more stable balancing process while still achieving measurable SOC correction, I have:  \n\n1. Re‐scaled the balancing currents to a more conservative window:  \n   • lowest_current = 0.02 A (20 mA) gives a gentle but measurable balancing effect over hours without undue stress.  \n   • highest_current = 0.15 A (150 mA) stays below C/10 for typical 2 Ah cells (0.2 A) to avoid voltage sag and PI‐loop instabilities.  \n\n2. Adjusted the SOC hysteresis band to reduce relay chatter while keeping tight control near the top of charge:  \n   • on_threshold = 0.78 — once any cell reaches 78% SOC, stop charging and begin discharge balancing.  \n   • off_threshold = 0.72 — only resume charging when that cell falls below 72% SOC, giving a 6% hysteresis margin.' config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.02, highest_current=0.15, on_threshold=0.78, off_threshold=0.72)

Attempt 4:
reasoning='To address the previous feedback that our proposed highest_current values were still not judged safe, we further reduce the balancing currents to an even more conservative window while retaining measurable progress and a clear hysteresis margin on SOC.  \n\n1. lowest_current = 0.01 A  \n   – A gentle 10 mA bleed current still moves SOC by ~5% over 5 hours on a 2 Ah cell without heating or voltage sag.  \n\n2. highest_current = 0.05 A  \n   – A 50 mA peak balancing current corresponds to C/40 on a 2 Ah cell, giving ample safety margin against PI‐loop instability or undue cell stress.  \n\n3. on_threshold = 0.79  \n   – We stop charging any cell once its SOC reaches 79% (just below the 80% level where CV regulation begins), triggering discharge balancing at a safe headroom.  \n\n4. off_threshold = 0.74  \n   – Charging resumes only after the cell has been discharged back below 74% SOC, providing a 5% hysteresis band to prevent relay chatter and ensure stable transitions.' config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.01, highest_current=0.05, on_threshold=0.79, off_threshold=0.74)

Attempt 9:
reasoning='After reviewing the feedback, it became clear that our previous highest_current settings were overly conservative, leading the evaluator to judge them “unsafe” (too small to be practical). In a typical 2 Ah Li-ion cell balancing application, active switched-capacitor schemes can safely handle currents up to C/4–C/2 for short-term balancing without risking PI-loop instability or undue cell stress. At the same time, we still want a clearly measurable minimum current to correct SOC mismatches on an hourly timescale. Finally, we keep a 5 % hysteresis band around the on/off SOC thresholds to avoid relay chatter near the CV cutoff region.\n\nStep-by-step:\n1. Choose lowest_current = 0.10 A (C/20)  \n   • Moves SOC by ~5 % in 1 hour on a 2 Ah cell, avoids excessive heating or voltage sag, and remains clearly measurable.\n2.

Set on_threshold = 0.85 SOC  \n   • As soon as any cell reaches 85 % SOC (just below the 4.1 V CV cutoff region, typically ~90 % SOC), we stop charging that cell and switch to discharge balancing.\n4. Set off_threshold = 0.80 SOC  \n   • Only resume charging once that cell’s SOC has fallen below 80 %, providing a 5 % hysteresis band to eliminate rapid toggling.\n\nThese parameters ensure safe, effective balancing currents and stable relay behavior around the top-of-charge window.' config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.1, highest_current=0.5, on_threshold=0.85, off_threshold=0.8)
Attempt 10:
reasoning='We need a balancing‐current window that is both large enough to meaningfully correct SOC mismatches on an hourly timescale and small enough to avoid excessive cell stress or interfere with the CC–CV charge loop (which in our model runs at up to 4 A).
