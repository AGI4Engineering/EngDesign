reasoning='We need to implement a `read` operation that:\n1. Resolves an absolute or relative path against the in-memory filesystem (assuming inode 1 is the root).  \n2. Validates that the final target exists and is a regular file (not a directory).  \n3. Checks that the requested offset `pos` is within `[0, size]`.  \n4. Computes the end position (`pos + length` capped at EOF).  \n5. Reads the necessary blocks from `inode.direct_blocks`, concatenating them, then slicing out exactly the requested byte range.  \n6. Decodes the collected bytes as UTF-8 and returns the string.  \n\nKey edge cases:\n- Missing path components → `FileNotFoundError`.  \n- Target is directory → `IsADirectoryError`.  \n- Negative or out-of-bounds `pos` → `ValueError`.  \n- Read beyond EOF simply returns up to EOF.\n\nThe implementation below follows these steps precisely.' config=ConfigFile(read='def read(fs_img: FileSystemImage, name: str, pos: int, length: int) -> str:\n    """Read up to `length` bytes from the file called `name` starting at offset `pos`."""\n    # 1.
