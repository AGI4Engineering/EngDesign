Attempt 1:
reasoning='To infer each missing block, I examined signal origins, destinations, and known Simulink-PS interface requirements. A receives the three SOC signals (as a bus) through a ZOH block and must pick the active cell SOC to drive the relay, so it’s a Max block. B and C are the two current sources that the relay selects between for charge/discharge, mapping to the ‘currentwhencharging’ and ‘currentwhendischarging’ constant current blocks. D is the physical current connection from the switched‐capacitor network into the battery block, so it’s a Current Output Port (a Simscape physical port). E provides the battery CC-CV block with the pack voltage threshold (4.1 V), so it’s a Constant. The network current measured by the PS-Simulink Converter (G) is scaled or sign-adjusted before feeding back into the battery block, so F is a Gain. G converts the Simscape physical current signal into a Simulink signal, so it’s a PS-Simulink Converter. At the bottom, I follows a ZOH on the summed cell voltages to compute pack voltage, so it’s a Sum block. Inside the battery CC-CV block J is the discrete integrator element drawn as 1/z, which is a Unit Delay block.' config=ConfigFile(A='max', B='currentwhencharging', C='currentwhendischarging', D='current output port', E='constant', F='gain', G='ps-simulink converter', I='sum', J='unit delay')
Attempt 2:
reasoning='First, identify the block A that selects the highest SOC among the three cells to drive the relay. This is a Max block over the three SOC signals, so A = "max".  \n\nNext, the relay generates charge‐enable and discharge‐enable control signals. The battery CC‐CV block needs a boolean input to enable charging; that is provided by the charging‐enable output of the relay, so B = "chargingenabled".  \n\nThe battery CC‐CV block also needs the pack voltage feedback. The measured cell voltages are fed through a sensor block to Simulink; that block is "cellvoltage", so C = "cellvoltage".  \n\nThe CC‐CV block takes two separate current reference inputs: one for charging current and one for discharging. The charging‐current reference is D = "currentwhencharging", and the discharging‐current reference is E = "currentwhendischarging".  \n\nThe final current command passes through a sign‐adjusting block to align polarity; that is a Gain block, so F = "gain".  \n\nA constant magnitude of balancing current is defined by a Constant block, so G = "constant".  \n\nTo select the maximum cell voltage for the CC‐CV control, the measured voltages are passed through another Max block, so I = "max".  \n\nFinally, the CC‐CV subsystem exports its physical current port via a Simulink-PS interface labeled as a Current Output Port, so J = "current output port".' config=ConfigFile(A='max', B='chargingenabled', C='cellvoltage', D='currentwhencharging', E='currentwhendischarging', F='gain', G='constant', I='max', J='current output port')
