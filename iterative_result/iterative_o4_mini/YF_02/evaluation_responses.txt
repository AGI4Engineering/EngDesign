reasoning="We need Th such that the maximum midspan deflection δ ≤ 1 mm under two 1000 N loads at quarter‐span points. Treating the beam as simply supported of span L=1000 mm, width b=40 mm, thickness h=Th, and E=210 000 N/mm²:\n\n1. Second moment of area: I = b·h³/12 = (40·Th³)/12 = (10/3)·Th³ mm⁴.\n2. Superpose deflections from the two symmetric point loads:\n   • Load at a=250 mm (≤ x=L/2): δ₁ = [F·b'·x·(L²–b'²–x²)]/(6EI L), with b'=L–a=750 mm, x=500 mm.\n   • Load at a=750 mm (> x): δ₂ = [F·a·x·(L²–a²–x²)]/(6EI L).\n   Numerically both contributions simplify to δ₁ ≃ 16748/Th³ and δ₂ ≃ 5579/Th³ (both in mm), so total δ ≃ 22327/Th³.\n3. Enforce δ ≤ 1 mm ⇒ Th³ ≥ 22327 ⇒ Th ≥³√22327 ≃ 28.2 mm.\n\nTo allow a margin for modeling uncertainties and ensure stiffness stays well below the 1 mm limit, we choose Th = 30 mm." config=ConfigFile(Th=30.0)
