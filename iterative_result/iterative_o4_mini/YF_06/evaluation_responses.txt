reasoning='We estimate the mid‐span deflection of a uniformly loaded, orthogonally clamped rectangular plate using classical plate theory. For a plate of shorter span a=500 mm and longer span b=1000 mm under uniform pressure p, the maximum deflection is given by\n\n  wmax = α·p·a^4 / D\n\nwhere D = E·t^3 / [12(1–ν^2)] is the flexural rigidity, and α is a dimensionless coefficient that depends on the aspect ratio a/b and boundary conditions. For a clamped plate with a/b=0.5, reference tables give α≈0.00293.\n\nGiven:\n  E = 210 000 MPa,\n  ν = 0.3,\n  p = 2 N/mm²,\n  a = 500 mm,\n  α = 0.00293.\n\nCompute D:\n  D = 210 000·t^3 / [12·(1–0.3²)] ≈ (210 000 / 10.92)·t^3 ≈ 19 230·t^3   (N·mm)\n\nThus\n  wmax = 0.00293·2·(500)^4 / (19 230·t^3)\n       ≈ (0.00586·6.25·10^10) / (19 230·t^3)\n       ≈ 1.905·10^4 / t^3    (mm)\n\nSetting wmax = 1 mm yields\nt^3 ≈ 1.905·10^4  ⇒  t ≈ (1.905·10^4)^(1/3) ≈ 26.8 mm.\n\nRounding to an integer thickness and adding a small safety margin, we select t = 27 mm.' config=ConfigFile(Th=27.0)
