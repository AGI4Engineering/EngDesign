Since 21 dB corresponds to a magnitude ratio of about 11.2, we need α_n to provide enough attenuation. A good starting point would be α_n = 0.1, which gives about 20 dB attenuation.\n3. f_n (width of the notch): This controls the Q-factor. Since we have resonances at 11.3 and 14.2 rad/sec, our notch should be wide enough to cover this range. A value of f_n = 0.7 should give a reasonable width.\n\nThese parameter choices should:\n- Place the notch at the resonance frequency (13 rad/sec)\n- Provide enough attenuation (about 20 dB) to reduce the 21 dB peak\n- Have sufficient width to address the nearby gain crossings at 11.3 and 14.2 rad/sec\n\nWith the notch filter, the final controller will be:\nC_final(s) = C(s) * K_n(s)\n\nThe numerator of C(s) is [5.416, 5.139], and the denominator is [1, 0].\nThe parameters for the notch filter K_n(s) are ω_n = 13, α_n = 0.1, and f_n = 0.7.", config=ConfigFile(C_num=[5.416, 5.139], C_den=[1.0, 0.0], omega_n=13.0, alpha_n=0.1, f_n=0.7)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'num_passed': False, 'den_passed': False, 'stability_passed': False, 'phase_margin_passed': False, 'gain_margin_passed': False, 'score': 0.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 0.0}
