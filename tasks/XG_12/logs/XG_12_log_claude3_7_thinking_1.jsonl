For Task 1, I calculated the initial controller by finding K_g = 1/|G(jω_L)| where ω_L = 3 rad/sec. I computed |G(j3)| = 0.176, giving K_g = 5.682. For the integral boost K_i(s), I substituted β_b = √10 ≈ 3.162 and found K_i(s) = (0.953s + 0.905)/s. Combining these, I got C(s) = (5.417s + 5.139)/s.\n\nFor Task 2, I designed a notch filter to attenuate the resonance peak at 13 rad/sec. Since the loop gain is 21 dB at resonance, I aimed for a 25 dB attenuation to bring it below 0 dB. This gives α_n = 0.056. I set ω_n = 13 rad/sec to match the resonance frequency and chose f_n = 0.5 for a relatively narrow notch. The resulting notch filter is K_n(s) = (s^2 + 1.541s + 169) / (s^2 + 27.426s + 169). Combining this with the initial controller, I computed the numerator and denominator of the final controller C'(s).", config=ConfigFile(C_num=[5.417, 5.139], C_den=[1.0, 0.0], omega_n=13.0, alpha_n=0.056, f_n=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'num_passed': False, 'den_passed': False, 'stability_passed': True, 'phase_margin_passed': False, 'gain_margin_passed': False, 'gain_margin': matlab.double([[0.0,1.713181470028542]]), 'phase_margin': 47.18765727860111, 'score': 20.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 20.0}
