Since we need to attenuate a 21 dB peak, αn should be small enough to create sufficient attenuation. I'll set αn = 0.01, which gives approximately 40 dB of attenuation at the notch frequency.\n3) fn determines the width of the notch. I'll set fn = 1 for a standard width, as the resonance seems to be focused around 13 rad/sec.\n\nWith these parameters:\n- ωn = 13 rad/sec\n- αn = 0.01\n- fn = 1\n\nThis should create a notch filter that attenuates the resonance at 13 rad/sec, making the closed-loop system stable with adequate phase and gain margins.\n\nThe final controller will be:\nC(s) * Kn(s) = (5.42s + 5.14)/s * (s^2 + 1.3s + 169)/(s^2 + 130s + 169)\n\nThis combination should:\n1) Provide the desired bandwidth at 3 rad/sec (from the initial controller)\n2) Attenuate the resonance at 13 rad/sec (from the notch filter)\n3) Result in a stable closed-loop system with sufficient phase and gain margins\n\nThe notch filter significantly reduces the loop gain around the resonance frequency, preventing the additional gain crossings at 11.3 and 14.2 rad/sec that were causing instability.", config=ConfigFile(C_num=[5.42, 5.14], C_den=[1.0, 0.0], omega_n=13.0, alpha_n=0.01, f_n=1.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'num_passed': False, 'den_passed': False, 'stability_passed': True, 'phase_margin_passed': False, 'gain_margin_passed': True, 'gain_margin': matlab.double([[0.0,9.595997069677619]]), 'phase_margin': 8.163782660094501, 'score': 40.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 40.0}
