A typical value is chosen to sufficiently attenuate the resonance.\n   - The width of the notch is controlled by f_n. A value is chosen to ensure the notch is narrow enough to not affect frequencies outside the resonance.\n\n2. **Form the notch filter transfer function K_n(s):**\n   - Substitute ω_n = 13, α_n = 0.1, and f_n = 1 into the notch filter formula.\n   - Expand and simplify to get the numerator and denominator coefficients.\n\n3. **Combine with the initial controller:**\n   - The final controller is the product of the initial controller C(s) and the notch filter K_n(s).\n   - The coefficients of the combined transfer function are computed.\n\n4. **Verify stability and margins:**\n   - The closed-loop system is analyzed to ensure it meets the phase margin (≥60 degrees) and gain margin (≥2 dB) requirements.\n   - Adjust notch filter parameters if necessary to meet these requirements.', config=ConfigFile(C_num=[1.0, 3.0], C_den=[1.0, 0.0], omega_n=13.0, alpha_n=0.1, f_n=1.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'num_passed': False, 'den_passed': False, 'stability_passed': False, 'phase_margin_passed': False, 'gain_margin_passed': False, 'score': 0.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 0.0}
