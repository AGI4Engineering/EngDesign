The initial design is unstable due to gain crossings at 11.3 and 14.2 rad/sec caused by resonance around 13 rad/sec.\n\n2.  **Determine ωn (Notch Frequency):**\n    The resonance frequency is given as 13 rad/sec. The notch filter should be centered at this frequency.\n    So, ωn = 13.0 rad/sec.\n\n3.  **Determine αn (Notch Depth Parameter):**\n    The loop without the notch filter has a magnitude of 21 dB near the resonance frequency. This means the gain is 10^(21/20) ≈ 11.22.\n    To stabilize the system and ensure adequate gain margin (e.g., >2 dB), this peak must be attenuated to well below 0 dB. Let's target reducing the peak at resonance to -6 dB.\n    The required attenuation from the notch filter is 21 dB (to bring the peak to 0 dB) + 6 dB (for further reduction) = 27 dB.\n    The magnitude of the notch filter at s = jωn is |K_n(jωn)| = αn.\n    So, 20 * log10(αn) = -27 dB.\n    αn = 10^(-27/20) = 10^(-1.35) ≈ 0.044668.\n    We will use αn ≈ 0.04467.\n\n4.  **Determine fn (Notch Width/Damping Parameter):**\n    fn affects the width of the notch and its phase contribution at other frequencies, notably the loop crossover frequency ωL = 3 rad/sec.\n    The phase contribution of K_n(s) at ω << ωn is approximately: Angle(K_n(jω)) ≈ (fn * ω / ωn) * (sqrt(αn) - 1/sqrt(αn)) radians.\n    At ωL = 3 rad/sec, ωn = 13 rad/sec, αn ≈ 0.04467:\n    sqrt(αn) ≈ sqrt(0.04467) ≈ 0.21135.\n    1/sqrt(αn) ≈ 1 / 0.21135 ≈ 4.73154.\n    Phase lag at ωL ≈ (fn * 3 / 13) * (0.21135 - 4.73154) ≈ fn * 0.230769 * (-4.52019) ≈ -1.0430 fn radians.\n    In degrees, this is -1.0430 * fn * (180/π) ≈ -59.76 * fn degrees.\n    To minimize impact on the phase margin at ωL (which should be >= 60 degrees), we need to keep this phase lag small. A common choice for fn is in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 for practical notch filters.\n    Let's choose fn = 0.1. This results in a phase lag of approximately -5.98 degrees at ωL = 3 rad/sec, which is generally acceptable.\n    With fn = 0.1, ωn = 13, αn ≈ 0.04467:\n    Damping of zeros: ζ_num = (fn * sqrt(αn)) / 2 = (0.1 * 0.21135) / 2 ≈ 0.01057 (sharp notch).\n    Damping of poles: ζ_den = fn / (2 * sqrt(αn)) = 0.1 / (2 * 0.21135) ≈ 0.1 / 0.4227 ≈ 0.23657 (reasonably damped poles).\n    The bandwidth of influence of such a notch (e.g., poles at ωn * sqrt(1 ± 2ζ_den)) will cover the unstable region (11.3 to 14.2 rad/sec). The -3dB points of the denominator part are roughly at ωn(1 ± ζ_den) if ζ_den is small, giving a sense of width; here it's ωn ± ζ_den*ωn = 13 ± 0.23657*13 ≈ 13 ± 3.07 rad/s, i.e., [9.93, 16.07] rad/s. This range effectively covers the unstable frequencies.\n    So, fn = 0.1 is a reasonable choice.", config=ConfigFile(C_num=[5.41452, 5.13821], C_den=[1.0, 0.0], omega_n=13.0, alpha_n=0.04467, f_n=0.1)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'num_passed': False, 'den_passed': False, 'stability_passed': True, 'phase_margin_passed': True, 'gain_margin_passed': True, 'gain_margin': matlab.double([[0.0,2.1617334555172287]]), 'phase_margin': 65.82694376570976, 'score': 60.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 60.0}
