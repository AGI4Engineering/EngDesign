Set ωn = 13 rad/sec (center frequency of the notch at the resonance)\n2. αn determines the depth of the notch. Since we need to attenuate a 21 dB peak, we need a deep notch. Let's set αn = 0.01, which gives approximately 40 dB of attenuation at the center frequency.\n3. fn determines the width of the notch. Since we need to address gain crossings at 11.3 and 14.2 rad/sec, we need a moderately wide notch. Let's set fn = 0.5.\n\nThe final controller will be:\nC(s) = Kg · Ki(s) · Kn(s)\n\nWith the notch filter, the loop gain near the resonance will be significantly reduced, which should eliminate the additional gain crossings at 11.3 and 14.2 rad/sec. This should stabilize the closed-loop system and provide adequate phase and gain margins.\n\nTherefore:\n- ωn = 13 rad/sec\n- αn = 0.01\n- fn = 0.5\n\nLet me verify the transfer function of the complete controller:\nC(s) = (5.415·s + 5.142)/s · (s² + (0.5·13·√0.01)·s + 13²)/(s² + ((0.5·13)/√0.01)·s + 13²)\n     = (5.415·s + 5.142)/s · (s² + 0.65·s + 169)/(s² + 65·s + 169)\n\nAfter multiplication with the notch filter, the final controller is:\nC(s) = (5.415·s³ + 5.142·s² + 3.52·s² + 3.342·s + 915.135·s + 869.0)/[s · (s² + 65·s + 169)]\n     = (5.415·s³ + 8.662·s² + 918.477·s + 869.0)/[s · (s² + 65·s + 169)]\n     = (5.415·s³ + 8.662·s² + 918.477·s + 869.0)/(s³ + 65·s² + 169·s)\n\nTherefore, the final controller's numerator coefficients are [5.415, 8.662, 918.477, 869.0]\nAnd denominator coefficients are [1, 65, 169, 0]\n\nThese values for the notch filter parameters should achieve the requirements of a stable closed-loop system with adequate phase and gain margins.", config=ConfigFile(C_num=[5.415, 5.142], C_den=[1.0, 0.0], omega_n=13.0, alpha_n=0.01, f_n=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'num_passed': False, 'den_passed': False, 'stability_passed': True, 'phase_margin_passed': False, 'gain_margin_passed': True, 'gain_margin': matlab.double([[0.0,9.611265850239441]]), 'phase_margin': 25.679015555942744, 'score': 40.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 40.0}
