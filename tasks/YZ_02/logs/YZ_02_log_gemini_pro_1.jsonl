{"completion_tokens": 273, "response": "reasoning=\"This task requires me to determine two sets of coefficients for two equations. The first equation relates the cutoff frequency of a Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter to its characteristic parameters. The second equation defines a wider half-magnitude interval based on the cutoff frequency. My goal is to find the coefficients that satisfy specific conditions related to the filter's performance, such as the accuracy of the cutoff frequency estimation and the smoothness and noise reduction capabilities of the filter with different weighting strategies. Essentially, I need to solve two fitting problems, ensuring that the solutions meet the given constraints. I will start by determining coefficients $b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3$ in the expression for F_{-3dB}. Then I will determine coefficients $c_0, c_1, c_2$ in the expression for $n_{hW}$.\" config=Config(coeff_list_1=[51.83, -2.16, -0.37, 1.65], coeff_list_2=[0.34, 1.83, -0.01])", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"coeff_1": "[[51.83,-2.16,-0.37,1.65]]", "coeff_2": "[[0.34,1.83,-0.01]]", "F3dB": 0.0014675026454304375, "nhW": 7467.0, "rSGwNone": -69.88618172056266, "rSGwSqHann": -67.37718571726504, "rSGwTriang": -69.0943483645598, "rSGwOptimal": -69.39029137251282, "sSGwNone": -153.34937598865667, "sSGwSqHann": -196.84561242237078, "sSGwTriang": -201.64945667050557, "sSGwOptimal": -202.20825982236966, "check_1": false, "check_2": true, "check_3": true, "check_4": true, "check_5": true, "check_6": true, "check_7": true}, "score": 75.0}
