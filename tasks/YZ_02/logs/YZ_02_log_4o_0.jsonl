The expression is:\n\n$$F_{-3dB} = \\frac{F_s}{b_0(n_h+0.5)/(m+b_1)-(b_2+b_3*m)/(n_h+0.5)}$$\n\nWe are given the parameters $m = 6$ and $n_h = 50$. The requirement is that the estimated cutoff frequency $F_{-3dB}$ satisfies $abs(F_{-3dB}/F_s - 0.023) <= 0.003$. This means we need to find the coefficients such that the expression evaluates to a value within this range when divided by $F_s$.\n\nTo find these coefficients, we can start by setting up the equation with the given requirement:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{F_{-3dB}}{F_s} - 0.023\\right| \\leq 0.003$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $F_{-3dB}$, we get:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{1}{b_0(n_h+0.5)/(m+b_1)-(b_2+b_3*m)/(n_h+0.5)} - 0.023\\right| \\leq 0.003$$\n\nWe can solve this equation for the coefficients by trial and error or using optimization techniques to minimize the difference between the left-hand side and 0.023.\n\nFor Task 2, we need to derive the coefficients (c_0, c_1, c_2) for the expression for the wider half-magnitude interval $n_{hW}$:\n\n$$n_{hW} = round(\\frac{c_0 + c_1 * m + c_2 * m^2}{F_{-3dB}/F_s} - 1)$$\n\nThe requirements for $n_{hW}$ are that it should be greater than $n_h$ and that the smoothness and noise ratios for the different weighting strategies should satisfy the given inequalities.\n\nTo find these coefficients, we can use a similar approach as in Task 1, setting up the equation with the requirement that $n_{hW} > n_h$ and solving for the coefficients. We can also use optimization techniques to ensure that the smoothness and noise ratios satisfy the given inequalities.\n\nLet's start by solving Task 1 to find the coefficients (b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3).", config=Config(coeff_list_1=[0.023, 0.003, 6.0, 50.0], coeff_list_2=[-70.0, -26.0])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Error': 'Index exceeds the number of array elements.
