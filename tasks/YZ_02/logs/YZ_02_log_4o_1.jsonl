{'completion_tokens': 442, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To solve Task 1, we need to determine the coefficients (b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3) in the given analytical expression for the cutoff frequency $F_{-3dB}$. The expression is:\n\n$$F_{-3dB} = \\frac{F_s}{b_0(n_h+0.5)/(m+b_1)-(b_2+b_3*m)/(n_h+0.5)}$$\n\nWe are given the parameters $m = 6$ and $n_h = 50$. The requirement is that the estimated cutoff frequency $F_{-3dB}$ satisfies:\n\n$$abs(F_{-3dB}/F_s - 0.023) <= 0.003$$\n\nTo find the coefficients, we can set up a system of equations based on the requirement and solve for the coefficients. However, without additional information or constraints, we can assume some initial values and iteratively adjust them to meet the requirement.\n\nFor Task 2, we need to derive the coefficients (c_0, c_1, c_2) for the expression of the wider half-magnitude interval $n_{hW}$:\n\n$$n_{hW} = round(\\frac{c_0 + c_1 * m + c_2 * m^2}{F_{-3dB}/F_s} - 1)$$\n\nThe requirements for $n_{hW}$ and the performance metrics (sSGw and rSGw) are given. We need to ensure that $n_{hW} > n_h$ and the order of the smoothness and noise ratios is as specified.\n\nTo solve these tasks, we will use the given parameters and requirements to derive the coefficients. We will start with Task 1 and then proceed to Task 2.', config=Config(coeff_list_1=[0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01], coeff_list_2=[1.0, 0.2, 0.1])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'coeff_1': matlab.double([[0.5,0.1,0.05,0.01]]), 'coeff_2': matlab.double([[1.0,0.2,0.1]]), 'F3dB': 0.24171135246937117, 'nhW': 23.0, 'rSGwNone': -19.808333180872182, 'rSGwSqHann': -17.517402131405618, 'rSGwTriang': -19.18254137010416, 'rSGwOptimal': -19.47335269361423, 'sSGwNone': -48.37727525793852, 'sSGwSqHann': -47.36169141991681, 'sSGwTriang': -51.99936008437243, 'sSGwOptimal': -52.54937423224561, 'check_1': False, 'check_2': False, 'check_3': False, 'check_4': False, 'check_5': False, 'check_6': True, 'check_7': True}, 'score': 20.0}
