{"completion_tokens": 296, "response": "reasoning='The problem requires determining coefficients for two analytical expressions related to Savitzky-Golay filters. The first expression relates the cutoff frequency to filter parameters, and the second expression determines the half-magnitude interval for weighted SG filters.  The goal is to find coefficients that satisfy specific conditions on the estimated cutoff frequency and filter performance metrics, leveraging least-squares fitting and MATLAB code for filter design and evaluation. Task 1 focuses on the unweighted filter. Task 2 focuses on weighted filters where the optimal, triangular, and squared Hann window weighting is applied, and the goal is to find parameters c0, c1, and c2 such that sSGwOptimal < sSGwTriang < sSGwSqHann < sSGwNone < -70 (dB), and rSGwNone < rSGwOptimal < rSGwTriang < rSGwSqHann < -26 (dB). Note that the MATLAB code is provided to determine the values.' config=Config(coeff_list_1=[123.4, 0.56, 1.78, 0.002], coeff_list_2=[1000.0, 1.5, 0.003])", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"Error": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684 1917141x1917141 (27384.1GB)\u6570\u7ec4\u8d85\u8fc7\u9884\u8bbe\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6570\u7ec4\u5927\u5c0f(18.0GB)\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4 MATLAB \u65e0\u54cd\u5e94\u3002"}, "score": 0.0}
