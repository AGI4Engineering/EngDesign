{"completion_tokens": 207, "response": "reasoning='The task requires the determination of coefficients for two analytical expressions related to Savitzky-Golay filter design. Task 1 focuses on an expression for the cutoff frequency, and Task 2 involves an expression for a wider half-magnitude interval.  The objective is to find coefficients that satisfy specific constraints on the calculated values and filter performance metrics based on provided MATLAB code. The constraints are about cutoff frequency and noise reduction ratio. Also to find the coefficients that keep the smoothness parameter with a certain range. Therefore, an optimization of the parameters must be performed in order to derive those coefficients.' config=Config(coeff_list_1=[113.5, -1.9, -2.4], coeff_list_2=[2.9, 0.0067, 0.00015])", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"Error": "\u7d22\u5f15\u8d85\u8fc7\u6570\u7ec4\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u7d22\u5f15\u4e0d\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7 3\u3002"}, "score": 0.0}
