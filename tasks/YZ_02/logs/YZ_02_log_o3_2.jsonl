{'completion_tokens': 2037, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Step-1  (Task-1 – choose b0…b3)\nWe need a set of coefficients that makes the analytical approximation\n   f  = F_{-3dB}/F_s = (m + b1) /( b0 (n_h+0.5) )\ncome out to the required 0.023 ±0.003 when m = 6 and n_h = 50 ( ⇒ n_h+0.5 = 50.5 ).\nTo keep the expression as simple as possible we set b2 = b3 = 0 so that only b0 and b1 determine the value.  Solving\n        0.023 = (6 + b1) / (b0 ⋅ 50.5)\n ⇒      6 + b1 = 0.023 ⋅ b0 ⋅ 50.5 = 1.1615 b0.\nChoosing an integer b0 = 8 gives\n        6 + b1 = 9.292 →  b1 = 3.292.\nWith b0 = 8, b1 = 3.292, b2 = 0, b3 = 0 we obtain exactly\n        F_{-3dB} / F_s = (6+3.292)/(8⋅50.5)=9.292/404 = 0.0230\nwhich satisfies the ±0.003 tolerance.\n\nStep-2  (Task-2 – choose c0…c2)\nThe wider half-magnitude interval is\n        n_{hW} = round( (c0 + c1 m + c2 m²) / (F_{-3dB}/F_s) – 1 ).\nWe want n_{hW} > 50. Taking the already fixed f = 0.023 and m = 6 we select the polynomial so that the numerator evaluates to ≃ 1.75, which gives n_{hW} ≃ 75.\nA very small second-order polynomial that fulfils this while remaining numerically well behaved is\n        c0 = 1.60 ,  c1 = 0.02 ,  c2 = 0.001.\nCheck:\n  c0 + c1 m + c2 m² = 1.6 + 0.02·6 + 0.001·36 = 1.6 + 0.12 + 0.036 = 1.756\n  n_{hW} = round( 1.756 / 0.023 – 1 ) = round( 76.35 – 1 ) = 75 > 50.\nThis window length (flW = 2·75+1 = 151) is safely wider than the original un-weighted filter, which in turn typically guarantees\n  • lower smoothness numbers s for the weighted designs and the ordering\n      s_optimal < s_triangular < s_squared-Hann < s_none < –70 dB,\n  • higher input/output noise ratios r in the reverse order and below –26 dB,\nas requested in the specification.\n\nTherefore the chosen coefficient sets solve both tasks concurrently.', config=Config(coeff_list_1=[8.0, 3.292, 0.0, 0.0], coeff_list_2=[1.6, 0.02, 0.001])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'coeff_1': matlab.double([[8.0,3.292,0.0,0.0]]), 'coeff_2': matlab.double([[1.6,0.02,0.001]]), 'F3dB': 0.023, 'nhW': 75.0, 'rSGwNone': -29.978185082247364, 'rSGwSqHann': -27.529371460032564, 'rSGwTriang': -29.241399902950604, 'rSGwOptimal': -29.536833217535502, 'sSGwNone': -71.71091306505548, 'sSGwSqHann': -77.31169009525036, 'sSGwTriang': -82.09905754865633, 'sSGwOptimal': -82.65698919883462, 'check_1': True, 'check_2': True, 'check_3': True, 'check_4': True, 'check_5': True, 'check_6': True, 'check_7': True}, 'score': 100.0}
