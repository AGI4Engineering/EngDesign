{'completion_tokens': 2101, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Task 1: We have the approximation\n  F_{-3dB}/F_s = 1/\n    [ b0*(n_h+0.5)/(m+b1)  –  (b2 + b3*m)/(n_h+0.5) ]\nwith m=6, n_h=50, and we require |F_{-3dB}/F_s – 0.023| ≤ 0.003.  We need to pick a minimal set of b-coefficients so that\n  D = b0*50.5/(6+b1)  –  (b2 + b3*6)/50.5 ≈ 1/0.023 ≈ 43.48.\nThe simplest choice is to set b1=b2=b3=0 so that D=b0*50.5/6.  Solving b0*50.5/6=43.48 gives b0≈5.17.  This yields\n  F_{-3dB}/F_s ≈ 1/(5.17*50.5/6)≈1/43.53≈0.02297, which lies within the 0.020–0.026 band.\n\nTask 2: We need n_{hW}>50 and we want to space the four SG filters so that their smoothness and noise-gain orderings fall in the specified descending thresholds.  The half-magnitude window is\n  n_{hW} = round((c0 + c1*m + c2*m^2)/(F_{-3dB}/F_s) – 1).\nWe already have F_{-3dB}/F_s≈0.02297; we wish to pick (c0,c1,c2) so that n_{hW}≈100 (which is safely >50) and then let the standard weighting strategies produce the desired smoothness/noise-gain ordering.  Thus we solve\n  (c0 + 6*c1 + 36*c2)/0.02297 – 1 ≈100  ⇒  c0+6c1+36c2≈(101)(0.02297)=2.322.\nThe simplest choice is c0=0, c1=0, c2=2.322/36≈0.0645, yielding n_{hW}=round(2.322/0.02297–1)=round(101.1–1)=100.\n\nWith these coefficients, flW=2*100+1=201.  Plugging into the four weighting schemes (none, triangular, squared Hann, optimal) reproduces the known order:\n  s_optimal < s_triangular < s_sqHann < s_none   (all below –70\u2009dB when converted to log scale)\n  r_none < r_optimal < r_triangular < r_sqHann   (all below –26\u2009dB)\n\nHence the final coefficient arrays are:\n  coeff_list_1 = [b0, b1, b2, b3] = [5.17, 0, 0, 0]\n  coeff_list_2 = [c0, c1, c2]       = [0, 0, 0.0645]', config=Config(coeff_list_1=[5.17, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], coeff_list_2=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0645])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'coeff_1': matlab.double([[5.17,0.0,0.0,0.0]]), 'coeff_2': matlab.double([[0.0,0.0,0.0645]]), 'F3dB': 0.022981021506405963, 'nhW': 100.0, 'rSGwNone': -32.46406282814934, 'rSGwSqHann': -29.999527022437576, 'rSGwTriang': -31.713784069365715, 'rSGwOptimal': -32.00943855592129, 'sSGwNone': -77.10323794998374, 'sSGwSqHann': -84.71802664352893, 'sSGwTriang': -89.512544185412, 'sSGwOptimal': -90.07085404647674, 'check_1': True, 'check_2': True, 'check_3': True, 'check_4': True, 'check_5': True, 'check_6': True, 'check_7': True}, 'score': 100.0}
