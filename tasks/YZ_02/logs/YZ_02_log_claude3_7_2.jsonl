After analyzing the equation's behavior:\n\nLet me try: b₀ = 5.2, b₁ = 1, b₂ = 0.5, b₃ = 0.1\n\nWith these values:\nF_{-3dB}/F_s = 1 / [5.2(50.5)/(6+1)-(0.5+0.1*6)/50.5]\n= 1 / [5.2(50.5)/7-(0.5+0.6)/50.5]\n= 1 / [37.614-(1.1/50.5)]\n= 1 / [37.614-0.0218]\n= 1 / 37.592\n= 0.0266\n\nThis is outside our range, so I need to adjust. Let me try: b₀ = 6.2, b₁ = 1, b₂ = 0.5, b₃ = 0.1\n\nF_{-3dB}/F_s = 1 / [6.2(50.5)/7-(0.5+0.6)/50.5]\n= 1 / [44.83-0.0218]\n= 1 / 44.808\n= 0.0223\n\nThis is within our acceptable range of 0.023 ± 0.003.\n\nTherefore, our coefficients for expression (1) are: b₀ = 6.2, b₁ = 1, b₂ = 0.5, b₃ = 0.1\n\n## Task 2: Determining coefficients (c₀, c₁, c₂)\n\nFor Task 2, I need to find coefficients for the expression: n_{hW} = round((c₀ + c₁*m + c₂*m²)/(F_{-3dB}/F_s) - 1)\n\nFirst, let's calculate F_{-3dB}/F_s using our coefficients from Task 1:\nF_{-3dB}/F_s = 0.0223\n\nNow, I need to determine n_{hW} that satisfies these requirements:\n- n_{hW} > n_h (so n_{hW} > 50)\n- The performance metrics for the different weightings must follow specific ordering\n\nLet me try: c₀ = 1.2, c₁ = 0.03, c₂ = 0.01\n\nWith m = 6:\nn_{hW} = round((1.2 + 0.03*6 + 0.01*6²)/(0.0223) - 1)\n= round((1.2 + 0.18 + 0.36)/0.0223 - 1)\n= round(1.74/0.0223 - 1)\n= round(78.027 - 1)\n= round(77.027)\n= 77\n\nThis gives n_{hW} = 77, which is greater than n_h = 50 as required.\n\nWith this value of n_{hW}, I can determine if the remaining requirements regarding performance metrics (s and r values) are satisfied. Based on the general behavior of these filters and the given requirements, I believe these coefficient values will lead to:\n\nsSGwOptimal < sSGwTriang < sSGwSqHann < sSGwNone < -70 (dB)\nrSGwNone < rSGwOptimal < rSGwTriang < rSGwSqHann < -26 (dB)\n\nTherefore, our coefficients for expression (2) are: c₀ = 1.2, c₁ = 0.03, c₂ = 0.01", config=Config(coeff_list_1=[6.2, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1], coeff_list_2=[1.2, 0.03, 0.01])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'coeff_1': matlab.double([[6.2,1.0,0.5,0.1]]), 'coeff_2': matlab.double([[1.2,0.03,0.01]]), 'F3dB': 0.02236796729910749, 'nhW': 77.0, 'rSGwNone': -30.2054550595239, 'rSGwSqHann': -27.754991656319646, 'rSGwTriang': -29.467280290001668, 'rSGwOptimal': -29.762739420805246, 'sSGwNone': -72.20806788318424, 'sSGwSqHann': -77.98806868106675, 'sSGwTriang': -82.77627075294052, 'sSGwOptimal': -83.33424655272628, 'check_1': True, 'check_2': True, 'check_3': True, 'check_4': True, 'check_5': True, 'check_6': True, 'check_7': True}, 'score': 100.0}
