Given m=6 and n_h=50, the requirement F_{-3dB}/F_s ≈0.023 led to solving the denominator equation. By neglecting the second term (assuming minimal contribution), b0 was approximated to 5, yielding F_{-3dB}/F_s ≈0.02377, within the tolerance. For Task 2, the expression for n_{hW} was structured to ensure n_{hW} >50. Setting coefficients c0=0, c1=0, c2=0.0335 ensures n_{hW}=51 when m=6, meeting the requirement.
