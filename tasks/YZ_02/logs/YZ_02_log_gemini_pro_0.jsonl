{"completion_tokens": 418, "response": "reasoning='The task is to derive coefficients for analytical expressions used in Savitzky-Golay filter design. Task 1 focuses on finding coefficients `b0`, `b1`, `b2`, and `b3` for an expression that approximates the -3dB cutoff frequency of an unweighted SG filter.  Task 2 aims to derive `c0`, `c1`, and `c2` for an expression that determines the half-magnitude interval for weighted SG filters. Both tasks require meeting specific conditions related to filter performance metrics. Specifically, in Task 1 the target is to find the coefficients for estimating cutoff frequency `F_{-3dB}` given filter order `m`, half-width interval `n_h`, and sample rate `F_s`, such that `abs(F_{-3dB}/F_s - 0.023) <= 0.003`. In Task 2, the goal is to derive coefficients `c0`, `c1`, and `c2` such that `n_{hW} > n_h`, `sSGwOptimal < sSGwTriang < sSGwSqHann < sSGwNone < -70`, and `rSGwNone < rSGwOptimal < rSGwTriang < rSGwSqHann < -26` are all satisfied, where `n_{hW}` is the half-magnitude interval, `s` is the smoothness parameter, and `r` is the output vs. input noise ratio for various weighting strategies.' config=Config(coeff_list_1=[38.5, 0.005, 0.13, 0.0001], coeff_list_2=[0.7, 0.001, 0.0001])", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"coeff_1": "[[38.5,0.005,0.13,0.0001]]", "coeff_2": "[[0.7,0.001,0.0001]]", "F3dB": 0.003088619244193357, "nhW": 229.0, "rSGwNone": -39.637960159822114, "rSGwSqHann": -37.14765625218428, "rSGwTriang": -38.8642592759021, "rSGwOptimal": -39.160146700182, "sSGwNone": -92.21971542724992, "sSGwSqHann": -106.15806268818972, "sSGwTriang": -110.96011019430782, "sSGwOptimal": -111.5188183215453, "check_1": false, "check_2": true, "check_3": true, "check_4": true, "check_5": true, "check_6": true, "check_7": true}, "score": 75.0}
