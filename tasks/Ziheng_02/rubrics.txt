## Rubric for evaluating the theta list to reach the destination
| Criterion | Points | Description |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| Position | 50 | Compute the Euclidean translation error (in millimeters) between the true and LLM‐computed end‐effector positions and award 50 points if it is less than 1mm (otherwise 0 points) |
| Orientation | 50 | Compute the rotational error by converting the relative rotation to an equivalent arc‑length in millimeters and award 50 points if it is less than 1mm (otherwise 0 points) |
