Forward kinematics (POE form):\n     T(θ) = Π_{i=1}^6 exp([S_i] θ_i) · M.\n2. Inverse kinematics via Newton–Raphson:\n   – Define error twist V(θ) = se3ToVec(log((T(θ))⁻¹ · T₁₀)).\n   – Compute spatial Jacobian J_s(θ) = [Ad_{e^[S₁]θ₁…e^[S_{i-1}]θ_{i-1}} S_i]_{i=1…6}.\n   – Update rule:   θ ← θ + J_s(θ)⁺ · V(θ),\n     where (·)⁺ denotes the pseudoinverse.\n3. Initialize θ = [0,0,0,0,0,0] and iterate until ∥V∥ < 1e–6.\n4.
