Given the spatial screw axes S and the homogeneous transformation matrix M_1in0, we can compute the joint variables θ by solving the equation T_1in0 = e^{[S1]θ1} e^{[S2]θ2} ... e^{[S6]θ6} M_1in0. This involves calculating the matrix exponentials and solving the resulting nonlinear equations for θ. The solution requires numerical methods such as Newton-Raphson or other iterative techniques to find the joint angles that satisfy the equation.
