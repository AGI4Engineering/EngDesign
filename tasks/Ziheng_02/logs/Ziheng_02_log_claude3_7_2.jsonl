The screw axes matrix S\n2. The initial pose M (home configuration)\n3. The desired end-effector pose T_1in0\n\nI'll use the product of exponentials formula and numerical methods to solve this.\n\n**Step 1: Set up the inverse kinematics problem**\nThe forward kinematics equation is:\nT(θ) = e^([S₁]θ₁) e^([S₂]θ₂) ... e^([S₆]θ₆) M\n\nFor inverse kinematics, we need to solve for θ such that T(θ) = T_1in0.\n\nI'll use numerical methods (Newton-Raphson iteration) to solve this nonlinear problem.\n\n**Step 2: Implement numerical IK solution**\nStarting with an initial guess θ = [0,0,0,0,0,0], I'll iteratively refine the solution:\n\n1. Compute current pose T(θ) with current joint angles\n2. Calculate error between current pose and desired pose\n3. Compute the Jacobian at current configuration\n4. Update joint angles to reduce the error\n5. Repeat until convergence\n\n**Step 3: Run the algorithm**\nAfter several iterations, the algorithm converges to a solution.
