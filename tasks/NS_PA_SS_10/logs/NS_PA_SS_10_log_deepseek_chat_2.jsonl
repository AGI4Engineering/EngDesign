{'completion_tokens': 592, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a serial-input 'divisible-by-5' detector, we need to implement a finite state machine (FSM) that tracks the current remainder of the cumulative binary value modulo 5. The FSM will have five states corresponding to remainders 0 through 4. On each clock cycle, the FSM will update its state based on the incoming bit (din) and the current remainder. The new remainder is calculated as (current_remainder * 2 + din) mod 5. The output (dout) will be high if the new remainder is 0. The design must also handle synchronous active-low reset (resetn), which clears the remainder to 0 and sets dout to 0. The implementation will use a combinational block to compute the next state and output based on the current state and input, and a sequential block to update the state on the rising edge of the clock.", code="module divisible_by_5_detector (\n    input  logic clk,      // clock signal\n    input  logic resetn,   // synchronous, active-low reset\n    input  logic din,      // serial input bit, MSB first\n    output logic dout      // high if current value mod 5 == 0\n);\n\n    // Internal state register to hold current remainder (0-4)\n    logic [2:0] remainder;\n\n    // Combinational logic to compute next remainder and output\n    always_comb begin\n        // Compute new remainder: (current_remainder * 2 + din) mod 5\n        case (remainder)\n            3'd0: remainder_next = din ? 3'd1 : 3'd0;\n            3'd1: remainder_next = din ? 3'd3 : 3'd2;\n            3'd2: remainder_next = din ? 3'd0 : 3'd4;\n            3'd3: remainder_next = din ? 3'd2 : 3'd1;\n            3'd4: remainder_next = din ? 3'd4 : 3'd3;\n            default: remainder_next = 3'd0; // Should never happen\n        endcase\n\n        // Set output high if new remainder is 0\n        dout = (remainder_next == 3'd0);\n    end\n\n    // Sequential logic to update state on clock edge\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin\n            // Synchronous reset: clear remainder and output\n            remainder <= 3'd0;\n        end else begin\n            // Update remainder with computed next state\n            remainder <= remainder_next;\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule"), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'compile_error': 'tb.sv:11: error: Unknown module type: model\n2 error(s) during elaboration.\n*** These modules were missing:\n        model referenced 1 times.\n***'}, 'score': 0}
