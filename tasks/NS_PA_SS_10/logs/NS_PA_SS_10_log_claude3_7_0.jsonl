{'completion_tokens': 1917, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="Let me design a finite state machine (FSM) to detect when a binary number is divisible by 5. I'll use the remainder approach as specified.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the division by 5 works in a bit-by-bit fashion:\n- When we shift in a new bit, we're essentially doubling the current value and adding the new bit.\n- For modulo 5 operations, we only need to track the remainder after division by 5.\n\nLet's work through the state transitions:\n1. If current remainder is 0:\n   - Next remainder with input 0: (0×2 + 0) % 5 = 0\n   - Next remainder with input 1: (0×2 + 1) % 5 = 1\n\n2. If current remainder is 1:\n   - Next remainder with input 0: (1×2 + 0) % 5 = 2\n   - Next remainder with input 1: (1×2 + 1) % 5 = 3\n\n3. If current remainder is 2:\n   - Next remainder with input 0: (2×2 + 0) % 5 = 4\n   - Next remainder with input 1: (2×2 + 1) % 5 = 0\n\n4. If current remainder is 3:\n   - Next remainder with input 0: (3×2 + 0) % 5 = 1\n   - Next remainder with input 1: (3×2 + 1) % 5 = 2\n\n5. If current remainder is 4:\n   - Next remainder with input 0: (4×2 + 0) % 5 = 3\n   - Next remainder with input 1: (4×2 + 1) % 5 = 4\n\nI'll need a 3-bit state register to represent the remainder (0-4), and the output will be high when the remainder is 0.\n\nNow, I'll implement this as SystemVerilog code with proper comments and synchronous logic.", code="module fifo2 (\n    input  logic clk,      // clock signal\n    input  logic resetn,   // synchronous, active-low reset: clears history\n    input  logic din,      // serial input bit, MSB first\n    output logic dout      // high if the current value mod 5 == 0\n);\n\n    // State register to hold the current remainder (mod 5)\n    // 3 bits are sufficient to represent values 0-4\n    logic [2:0] remainder_q, remainder_d;\n    \n    // Combinational logic to compute the next state\n    always_comb begin\n        // Calculate new remainder: (current_remainder * 2 + din) % 5\n        case (remainder_q)\n            3'd0: remainder_d = din ? 3'd1 : 3'd0;\n            3'd1: remainder_d = din ? 3'd3 : 3'd2;\n            3'd2: remainder_d = din ? 3'd0 : 3'd4;\n            3'd3: remainder_d = din ? 3'd2 : 3'd1;\n            3'd4: remainder_d = din ? 3'd4 : 3'd3;\n            default: remainder_d = 3'd0; // Should never happen\n        endcase\n    end\n    \n    // Sequential logic for state update\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin\n            // Reset - clear the remainder to 0\n            remainder_q <= 3'd0;\n        end else begin\n            // Normal operation - update the remainder\n            remainder_q <= remainder_d;\n        end\n    end\n    \n    // Output logic - dout is high when remainder is 0\n    assign dout = (remainder_q == 0);\n    \nendmodule"), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'compile_error': 'tb.sv:11: error: Unknown module type: model\n2 error(s) during elaboration.\n*** These modules were missing:\n        model referenced 1 times.\n***'}, 'score': 0}
