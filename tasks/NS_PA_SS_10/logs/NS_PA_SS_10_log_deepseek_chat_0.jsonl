{'completion_tokens': 709, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a serial-input 'divisible-by-5' detector in SystemVerilog, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The module processes a serial bitstream and outputs a signal when the cumulative value is divisible by 5. The key insight is that we only need to track the remainder modulo 5, not the entire cumulative value, to determine divisibility.\n\n2. **State Representation**: We use a 3-bit register to store the current remainder (values 0-4). This is sufficient since the remainder modulo 5 can only be in this range.\n\n3. **State Transition Logic**: For each incoming bit, the new remainder is computed as `(old_remainder * 2 + din) % 5`. This avoids the need to store the entire cumulative value.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output `dout` is set to 1 when the new remainder is 0, indicating divisibility by 5.\n\n5. **Reset Handling**: On reset, the remainder is cleared to 0, and `dout` is set to 0.\n\n6. **Synchronous Design**: All logic is synchronized to the clock edge, ensuring clean, glitch-free operation.\n\n7. **Combinational Logic**: The new remainder is computed combinationally from the current remainder and the input bit, then registered on the next clock edge.\n\n8. **Parameterization**: The design inherently handles an arbitrarily long bitstream by focusing on the remainder, making it width-agnostic.", code="module divisible_by_5_detector (\n    input  logic clk,      // clock signal\n    input  logic resetn,   // synchronous, active-low reset\n    input  logic din,      // serial input bit, MSB first\n    output logic dout      // high if current value mod 5 == 0\n);\n\n    // Internal state: remainder modulo 5 (0-4)\n    logic [2:0] remainder;\n\n    // Combinational logic to compute next remainder\n    logic [2:0] next_remainder;\n    always_comb begin\n        case (remainder)\n            3'd0: next_remainder = din ? 3'd1 : 3'd0;\n            3'd1: next_remainder = din ? 3'd3 : 3'd2;\n            3'd2: next_remainder = din ? 3'd0 : 3'd4;\n            3'd3: next_remainder = din ? 3'd2 : 3'd1;\n            3'd4: next_remainder = din ? 3'd4 : 3'd3;\n            default: next_remainder = 3'd0; // Should never happen\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Synchronous state update and output\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin\n            remainder <= 3'd0;\n            dout <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            remainder <= next_remainder;\n            dout <= (next_remainder == 3'd0);\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule"), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'compile_error': 'tb.sv:11: error: Unknown module type: model\n2 error(s) during elaboration.\n*** These modules were missing:\n        model referenced 1 times.\n***'}, 'score': 0}
