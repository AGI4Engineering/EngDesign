The module should output a 1 whenever the cumulative binary value shifted in is evenly divisible by five.\n\n1.  **Module Name and Ports Analysis**:\n    *   The problem description provides an example `module model (...)` for the port definition.\n    *   However, the provided JSON schema specifies that the `code` field must contain "the SystemVerilog source for module `fifo2`."\n    *   To ensure the output matches the schema, the SystemVerilog module will be named `fifo2`.\n    *   The ports are: `clk` (input logic, clock signal), `resetn` (input logic, synchronous active-low reset), `din` (input logic, serial input bit, MSB first), and `dout` (output logic, high if the current number formed by `din` is divisible by 5).\n\n2.  **Core Logic - Finite State Machine (FSM)**:\n    *   The problem requires tracking the remainder of the cumulative binary number modulo 5.\n    *   This is a classic FSM problem. The states of the FSM will represent the possible remainders: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n    *   A 3-bit register is sufficient to store these 5 states (e.g., `logic [2:0] remainder_q`).\n    *   We\'ll use `localparam` to define symbolic names for these states (e.g., `R0`, `R1`, ..., `R4`) for readability.\n\n3.  **State Transition Calculation**:\n    *   Let `current_remainder` be the state stored in `remainder_q` and `input_bit` be `din`.\n    *   If the number formed so far is `N`, then `current_remainder = N mod 5`.\n    *   When a new bit `din` is shifted in (MSB first), the new number `N_new = (N << 1) + din`.\n    *   The new remainder is `N_new mod 5`. This can be calculated from the `current_remainder` and `din` as: `new_remainder = ((current_remainder * 2) + input_bit) mod 5`.\n    *   This logic will be implemented in a combinational block (`always_comb`) to calculate the next state (`remainder_d`) based on the current state (`remainder_q`) and `din`.\n    *   The transitions are as follows:\n        *   From R0 (rem=0): if din=0, next is R0; if din=1, next is R1.\n        *   From R1 (rem=1): if din=0, next is R2; if din=1, next is R3.\n        *   From R2 (rem=2): if din=0, next is R4; if din=1, next is R0.\n        *   From R3 (rem=3): if din=0, next is R1; if din=1, next is R2.\n        *   From R4 (rem=4): if din=0, next is R3; if din=1, next is R4.\n    *   A `default` case in the state transition logic will map any unexpected state back to `R0` for robustness.\n\n4.  **State Register Update (Sequential Logic)**:\n    *   A clocked process (`always_ff @(posedge clk)`) will update the state register `remainder_q`.\n    *   If `resetn` is low (active-low reset), `remainder_q` will be set to `R0` (remainder 0).\n    *   Otherwise (if `resetn` is high), `remainder_q` will be updated with the calculated `remainder_d`.\n\n5.  **Output Logic (`dout`)**:\n    *   `dout` should be 1 if the `new_remainder` is 0, and 0 otherwise.\n    *   The specification states "`dout` must be valid the same cycle the new bit is processed." This implies `dout` must be a combinational output.\n    *   `dout` will be based on `remainder_d` (which represents the `new_remainder`).\n    *   During reset (`resetn` is low), `dout` must be 0.\n    *   Therefore, the logic for `dout` will be: `assign dout = resetn && (remainder_d == R0);`.\n\n6.  **Parameterization and Constraints**:\n    *   "No fixed width": The FSM approach handles an arbitrarily long bitstream as it only depends on the current remainder and the incoming bit.\n    *   "MSB first": The calculation `(old_value << 1) + din` correctly processes MSB-first serial data.\n    *   All logic will be synchronous to `clk` for state updates, with combinational logic for next-state calculation and output generation, meeting standard synthesizable design practices.\n    *   Comments will be added for clarity.\n\nBy following these steps, a synthesizable SystemVerilog module meeting all specifications can be created.', code="// divisible_by_5_detector.sv\n// Module that detects if a serially input binary number (MSB first) is divisible by 5.\n\nmodule fifo2 (\n    input  logic clk,      // clock signal\n    input  logic resetn,   // synchronous, active-low reset: clears history\n    input  logic din,      // serial input bit, MSB first\n    output logic dout      // high if the current value mod 5 == 0\n);\n\n    // State definitions for remainders 0 through 4\n    localparam R0 = 3'b000; // Remainder 0\n    localparam R1 = 3'b001; // Remainder 1\n    localparam R2 = 3'b010; // Remainder 2\n    localparam R3 = 3'b011; // Remainder 3\n    localparam R4 = 3'b100; // Remainder 4\n\n    // State register for current remainder\n    logic [2:0] remainder_q; // Current remainder (state)\n    // Next state logic for remainder\n    logic [2:0] remainder_d; // Next remainder (next state)\n\n    // Combinational logic for next state calculation\n    // new_remainder = (current_remainder * 2 + din) mod 5\n    always_comb begin\n        case (remainder_q)\n            R0: remainder_d = din ?
