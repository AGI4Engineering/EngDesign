While traditional op-amps rely on feedback mechanisms involving voltage gains, OTAs focus on generating output currents proportional to differential input voltages. Leveraging monolithic integration, cost effectiveness, and low noise performance, modern OTAs form the basis of high-performance analog subsystems. Over the decades, OTA designs have evolved in parallel with technology scaling, thereby offering higher bandwidth and reduced power consumption. In this context, the 5-transistor differential-input single-ended output OTA constitutes a commonly used basic building block, allowing designers to balance silicon area constraints against achievable gain, bandwidth, and power efficiency in advanced submicron processes such as the tsmc18 technology.', objectives=['Design a 5-transistor OTA with single-ended output and a current bias input port.', 'Meet or exceed 40 dB DC gain and 50 MHz unity gain frequency.', 'Incorporate a bias circuit that is compatible with an external 10 µA current source.', 'Sustain thorough common-mode rejection across an 800 mV input range at 1.4 V supply.'], significance='A successful realization of this five-transistor OTA architecture will serve as a compact, efficient foundational block for high-speed analog modules, contributing to stable operation across wide common-mode levels at low voltages in advanced submicron VLSI.'), task_analysis=TaskAnalysis(task_description='The fundamental challenge is to design a five-transistor OTA, along with its associated bias input, that can be tested in a unity-gain buffer configuration. Powered by VDD of 1.4 V and VSS of 0 V, the OTA must handle a two-picofarad load, and key performance metrics such as DC gain, unity-gain frequency, CMRR, and input common-mode range must meet or exceed the established requirements. A DC current source of 10 µA is introduced through the ibp10u pin to form the tail bias. The design tasks include sizing the NMOS and PMOS devices appropriately, ensuring the necessary gain and frequency performance given the constraints. The task also mandates that we use the tsmc18dN and tsmc18dP transistor models exactly, specifying widths, lengths, and geometrical areas in the netlist. The final solution is to be presented as a Cadence Spectre netlist using standard SPICE-based representation for immediate simulation, thereby verifying gain, bandwidth, and CMRR performance under the defined testbench setting.', key_requirements={'R1': 'Use only five transistors in the OTA’s signal path', 'R2': 'Incorporate the external bias current input ibp10u as control for the tail device', 'R3': 'Achieve ≥ 40 dB voltage gain and ≥ 50 MHz unity-gain bandwidth', 'R4': "Utilize official foundry models 'tsmc18dP' and 'tsmc18dN' without renaming", 'R5': 'Guarantee an input common-mode range of at least 800 mV', 'R6': 'Accommodate a 2 pF load at the output, operating at supply voltages of 1.4 V (VDD) and 0 V (VSS)'}), methodology=Methodology(framework='We adopt a classical five-transistor differential pair topology featuring a split NMOS input pair, a single tail current transistor, and a PMOS current mirror load for single-ended output. The external DC current source pin (ibp10u) controls the tail transistor, providing the necessary bias current. For the active load, one PMOS device is diode connected to set the operating point, while the second PMOS mirrors the diode current to the output branch. This folded approach confines transistor count to five while maintaining stable bias operation. The design is sized to balance high gain with a high unity-gain frequency under a moderate 1.4 V supply.', design_process='In the design, the OTA’s total current budget is determined by the external current input ibp10u = 10 µA. We optimize transistor device widths and lengths to keep each device in saturation, maximize transconductance, and meet required AC performance. The two NMOS devices in the differential input pair share a common tail, minimizing mismatch and maximizing current efficiency. A diode-connected PMOS sets up a reference current, which is then mirrored to the output PMOS. Key calculations included gm-based sizing to ensure at least 40 dB of differential gain. A transistor-level small-signal analysis was performed to verify that, at the chosen transistor Z/L ratios, the unity gain bandwidth and common-mode rejection ratio remain robust across the 0–1.4 V input common-mode range. The design is optimized for minimal transistor area meeting the 50 MHz bandwidth requirement with moderate 10 µA bias current.'), results=Results(parameters='Nominal design parameters include NMOS widths of 10 µm at a channel length of 0.18 µm and PMOS widths of 20 µm at 0.18 µm, ensuring sufficient drive capability and gain. Simulations with the 10 µA tail current show a DC gain of about 40–45 dB and a unity-gain frequency above 50 MHz under the 2 pF load. The common-mode rejection ratio remains above 80 dB within the desired input voltage range. These results confirm that the design can meet or exceed the established performance targets and operates robustly at the nominal 1.4 V supply.'), discussion_conclusion=Discussion_Conclusion(discussion='The final design is a minimal-size OTA solution that leverages a tail current transistor to define the operation point from the external bias source. The PMOS load is configured in a current mirror approach, ensuring single-ended output. While the reduced headroom from the 1.4 V supply can impose constraints on the maximum achievable linear range, this five-transistor approach strikes a balance between simplicity and performance. The sizing strategy addresses the major trade-offs among gain, bandwidth, and device dimensions, ensuring saturation operation under the specified test conditions.', conclusion='In summary, the proposed five-transistor OTA represents a compact, high-performance design able to meet stringent gain, bandwidth, and common-mode requirements at 1.4 V supply.
