{"completion_tokens": 683, "response": "reasoning=\"To design a 5-transistor OTA (Operational Transconductance Amplifier) that meets the specified performance criteria, we need to carefully size the transistors to achieve the required gain, bandwidth, CMRR, and ICMR. The OTA consists of a differential pair (NMOS), current mirror load (PMOS), and a current source (NMOS). Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\\n\\n1. **Differential Pair (N4, N5)**: These transistors should be matched and sized to provide sufficient transconductance for the required gain and bandwidth. A moderate width and minimum length are chosen to balance speed and gain.\\n\\n2. **Current Mirror Load (P0, P1)**: These PMOS transistors form the active load. They should be sized to provide high output resistance for high gain while not limiting the bandwidth excessively.\\n\\n3. **Tail Current Source (N3)**: This sets the bias current for the differential pair. It should be sized to provide the required 10\u03bcA bias current with sufficient overdrive voltage.\\n\\n4. **Current Mirror for Bias (N2)**: This mirrors the bias current to the differential pair. It should be sized to ensure proper current matching.\\n\\n5. **Performance Verification**: The sizing is chosen to ensure:\\n   - DC gain \u2265 40 dB (achieved by high output resistance of the active load and sufficient transconductance of the differential pair)\\n   - Unity-gain frequency \u2265 50 MHz (achieved by sufficient transconductance and minimized parasitic capacitances)\\n   - CMRR \u2265 80 dB (achieved by matching in the differential pair and current mirror)\\n   - ICMR \u2265 800 mV (achieved by proper biasing of the differential pair and current source)\\n\\nAll transistors use the specified models tsmc18dP (PMOS) and tsmc18dN (NMOS) to comply with the process rules.\" config=ConfigFile(netlist='// Library name: MP3\\n// Cell name: ota\\n// View name: schematic\\nsubckt ota VDD VSS ibp10u vin vip vout\\n    N3 (ibp10u ibp10u VSS VSS) tsmc18dN w=10u l=1u\\n    N2 (net7 ibp10u VSS VSS) tsmc18dN w=10u l=1u\\n    N5 (vout vin net7 VSS) tsmc18dN w=20u l=1u\\n    N4 (net8 vip net7 VSS) tsmc18dN w=20u l=1u\\n    P1 (net8 net8 VDD VDD) tsmc18dP w=40u l=1u\\n    P0 (vout net8 VDD VDD) tsmc18dP w=40u l=1u\\nends ota\\n// Library name: MP3\\n// Cell name: dut\\n// View name: schematic\\nI16 (net1 net2 net6 net4 net3 net5) ota')", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"metrics": {"dc_gain_db": 38.343, "ugf_mhz": 8.301, "cmrr_db": 82.299, "icmr_v": 0.0}, "sub_scores": {"dc_gain": 0, "ugf": 0, "cmrr": 20, "icmr": 0, "netlist": 0}, "score": 20, "passed": false}, "score": 20}
