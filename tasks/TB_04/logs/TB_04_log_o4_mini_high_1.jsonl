{"completion_tokens": 6807, "response": "reasoning='To meet the requirement of a 5-transistor OTA plus its bias\u2010current device, we choose the classic single\u2010ended differential pair with an active PMOS current\u2010mirror load and one NMOS tail transistor.  \\n\\n1. Subcircuit ports: VDD, VSS, ibp10u (tail\u2010gate bias), vin, vip, vout.  \\n2. PMOS loads P1 (diode\u2010connected) and P2 (mirror) share their gate at the drain of P1 (internal net \u201cnetd\u201d).  P1\u2019s drain/gate is netd; P2\u2019s drain is vout.  Both sources and bulks tie to VDD.  \\n3. NMOS differential pair N3 (gate=vin) and N4 (gate=vip) have their sources at internal node \u201cnetbar\u201d and bulks at VSS; their drains go to netd and vout, respectively.  \\n4. NMOS tail device N5 ties drain to netbar, gate to ibp10u, source/bulk to VSS.  This provides the bias current IB (10 \u03bcA) externally.  \\n5. All MOSFETs instantiate the foundry models tsmc18dP or tsmc18dN.  Widths and lengths are chosen as multiples of the 180 nm rule to target \u226540 dB gain and \u226550 MHz UGF.  \\n6. We follow exactly the template ordering: header comments, \u201csubckt\u201d line, device list, \u201cends\u201d line, footer comments, and the top\u2010level instance I16.
