{"completion_tokens": 424, "response": "reasoning='To design a 5-transistor OTA (Operational Transconductance Amplifier) that meets the given specifications, we need to carefully size the transistors to achieve the required DC gain, unity-gain frequency, CMRR, and ICMR. The OTA consists of a differential pair (NMOS transistors), a current mirror load (PMOS transistors), and a bias current source. The sizing of the transistors is critical to meet the performance targets.
