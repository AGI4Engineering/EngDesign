{'completion_tokens': 10546, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1) We first solve the linear constraint F_max(N)=a N + b by imposing that at N=1600, F_max=200 and at N=2000, F_max=175, which yields a= -0.0625 and b=300. 2) Next, we create 15 global design points (N,F) via Latin Hypercube Sampling, ensuring that for N in [1600, 2000], F remains below F_max(N). 3) With N=1900, the normalized speed factor is f=0.5. Consequently the interpolated bounds become P_range=[100,140] and G_range=[0.4,0.65]. 4) For the local design, with S in [-9,3], P in [100,140], G in [0.4,0.65], and E in [0.5,5], we provide 30 Latin Hypercube sample points as listed.', config=ConfigFile(constraint_parameters=[-0.0625, 300.0], global_design_points=[[1613.0, 39.71], [1652.0, 64.19], [1697.0, 37.39], [1736.0, 169.21], [1772.0, 133.4], [1811.0, 88.39], [1865.0, 173.63], [1952.0, 102.16], [2012.0, 61.4], [2048.0, 117.2], [2087.0, 72.2], [2121.0, 149.6], [2157.0, 48.8], [2176.0, 169.4], [2193.0, 102.8]], normalized_speed_factor=0.5, P_range=[100.0, 140.0], G_range=[0.4, 0.65], local_design_points=[[-8.8, 100.67, 0.4, 0.58], [-8.4, 102.0, 0.41, 0.73], [-8.0, 103.33, 0.42, 0.88], [-7.6, 104.67, 0.43, 1.03], [-7.2, 106.0, 0.44, 1.18], [-6.8, 107.33, 0.45, 1.33], [-6.4, 108.67, 0.45, 1.48], [-6.0, 110.0, 0.46, 1.63], [-5.6, 111.33, 0.47, 1.78], [-5.2, 112.67, 0.48, 1.93], [-4.8, 114.0, 0.49, 2.08], [-4.4, 115.33, 0.5, 2.23], [-4.0, 116.67, 0.5, 2.38], [-3.6, 118.0, 0.51, 2.53], [-3.2, 119.33, 0.52, 2.68], [-2.8, 120.67, 0.53, 2.83], [-2.4, 122.0, 0.54, 2.98], [-2.0, 123.33, 0.55, 3.13], [-1.6, 124.67, 0.55, 3.28], [-1.2, 126.0, 0.56, 3.43], [-0.8, 127.33, 0.57, 3.58], [-0.4, 128.67, 0.58, 3.73], [0.0, 130.0, 0.59, 3.88], [0.4, 131.33, 0.6, 4.03], [0.8, 132.67, 0.6, 4.18], [1.2, 134.0, 0.61, 4.33], [1.6, 135.33, 0.62, 4.48], [2.0, 136.67, 0.63, 4.63], [2.4, 138.0, 0.64, 4.78], [2.8, 139.33, 0.65, 4.92]])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'detailed information': "Global input constraints in Task 1 are calculated correctly.\nSampling of global inputs gained from Task 2 satisfies constraints.\nThe sampling points of the global inputs gained from Task 2 don't satisfy the LHS sampling principle (LHS divides each variable's range into N intervals and ensures each sample uses a unique interval per dimension for uniform coverage).\nnormalized_speed_factor in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nP_range in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nG_range in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nThe sampling points of the local inputs gained from Task 4 don't satisfy the LHS sampling principle (LHS divides each variable's range into N intervals and ensures each sample uses a unique interval per dimension for uniform coverage).", 'total_score': 40}, 'score': 40}
