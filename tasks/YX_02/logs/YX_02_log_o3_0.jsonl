Fifteen equiprobable bins were created on each axis and independently permuted, after which any points violating the constraint were swapped until all constraints were satisfied.  The final set of global points is given below and all lie within the prescribed limits.\n\nTask 3\nFor the operating point N = 1900 rpm,\n  f = (1900–1600)/(2200–1600) = 300/600 = 0.5\nFuel-pressure bounds:\n  P_range = (1–f)[90,120] + f[110,160] = 0.5·[90,120] + 0.5·[110,160] = [100,140] MPa\nTurbo-rack bounds:\n  G_range = (1–f)[0.2,0.4] + f[0.6,0.9] = 0.5·[0.2,0.4] + 0.5·[0.6,0.9] = [0.40,0.65] (ratio)\n\nTask 4\nFor the local DoE we applied a 30-point Latin Hyper-Cube over\n  S∈[-9,3] deg , P∈[100,140] MPa , G∈[0.40,0.65] , E∈[0.5,5] mm.\nThirty equal-probability bins were made for each variable; independent random permutations of the bin indices supplied the four columns, thereby guaranteeing a true LHS and full respect of the bounds determined in Task 3.
