{'completion_tokens': 1151, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To accomplish the task, we followed a structured approach:\n\n1. **Task 1**: We determined the linear relationship between the maximum fuel mass (F_max) and engine speed (N) using the given breakpoints (N=1600, F=200) and (N=2000, F=175). The slope (a) was calculated as (175-200)/(2000-1600) = -0.0625, and the intercept (b) was found by substituting one of the points into the equation, resulting in b = 300. Thus, the relationship is F_max = -0.0625 * N + 300.\n\n2. **Task 2**: Using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), we generated 15 design points for (N, F) within the specified ranges. For N in [1600, 2000], we ensured F â‰¤ F_max by applying the linear constraint. Outside this interval, F could range freely up to 200.\n\n3. **Task 3**: For N=1900 rpm, we calculated the normalized speed factor f = (1900-1600)/(2200-1600) = 0.5. Using this, we interpolated the bounds for P and G:\n   - P_range = (1-0.5)*[90,120] + 0.5*[110,160] = [100, 140]\n   - G_range = (1-0.5)*[0.2,0.4] + 0.5*[0.6,0.9] = [0.4, 0.65]\n\n4. **Task 4**: We generated 30 local LHS samples for (S, P, G, E) within their respective bounds, using the interpolated P_range and G_range from Task 3.', config=ConfigFile(constraint_parameters=[-0.0625, 300.0], global_design_points=[[1600.0, 50.0], [1650.0, 180.0], [1700.0, 120.0], [1750.0, 90.0], [1800.0, 150.0], [1850.0, 110.0], [1900.0, 130.0], [1950.0, 100.0], [2000.0, 175.0], [2050.0, 80.0], [2100.0, 160.0], [2150.0, 70.0], [2200.0, 200.0], [1675.0, 140.0], [1725.0, 95.0]], normalized_speed_factor=0.5, P_range=[100.0, 140.0], G_range=[0.4, 0.65], local_design_points=[[-6.0, 105.0, 0.45, 2.5], [0.0, 115.0, 0.5, 3.0], [-3.0, 125.0, 0.55, 1.5], [1.0, 135.0, 0.6, 4.0], [-8.0, 110.0, 0.42, 2.0], [2.0, 120.0, 0.52, 3.5], [-5.0, 130.0, 0.58, 1.0], [-1.0, 140.0, 0.62, 4.5], [-7.0, 102.0, 0.43, 2.2], [3.0, 118.0, 0.53, 3.2], [-4.0, 128.0, 0.56, 1.8], [-2.0, 138.0, 0.61, 4.2], [-9.0, 100.0, 0.4, 0.5], [-6.5, 108.0, 0.44, 2.3], [1.5, 122.0, 0.54, 3.3], [-3.5, 132.0, 0.57, 1.7], [-0.5, 136.0, 0.63, 4.3], [-7.5, 104.0, 0.41, 2.1], [2.5, 116.0, 0.51, 3.1], [-4.5, 126.0, 0.59, 1.9], [-1.5, 134.0, 0.64, 4.1], [-8.5, 101.0, 0.39, 0.6], [-6.2, 107.0, 0.46, 2.4], [1.2, 121.0, 0.49, 3.4], [-3.2, 131.0, 0.6, 1.6], [-0.2, 137.0, 0.65, 4.4], [-7.2, 103.0, 0.47, 2.6], [2.2, 117.0, 0.48, 3.6], [-4.2, 127.0, 0.58, 1.4], [-1.2, 133.0, 0.62, 4.6]])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'detailed information': "Global input constraints in Task 1 are calculated correctly.\nSampling of global inputs gained from Task 2 satisfies constraints.\nThe sampling points of the global inputs gained from Task 2 don't satisfy the LHS sampling principle (LHS divides each variable's range into N intervals and ensures each sample uses a unique interval per dimension for uniform coverage).\nnormalized_speed_factor in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nP_range in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nG_range in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nThe sampling points of the local inputs gained from Task 4 don't satisfy the LHS sampling principle (LHS divides each variable's range into N intervals and ensures each sample uses a unique interval per dimension for uniform coverage).", 'total_score': 40}, 'score': 40}
