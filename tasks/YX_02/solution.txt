## Task 1 solution:
constraint_parameters = [-0.0625, 300]

## Task 2 solution:
The quality of the sampling points of the global inputs is checked by evaluate.py.

## Task 3 solution:
normalized_speed_factor = 0.5
P_range = [100, 140]
G_range = [0.4, 0.65]

## Task 4 solution:
The quality of the sampling points of the local inputs is checked by evaluate.py.
