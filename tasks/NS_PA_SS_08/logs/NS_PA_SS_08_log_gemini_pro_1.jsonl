{'completion_tokens': 2239, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The user requires a SystemVerilog module named `model` for target sequence detection. This module needs to be synthesizable and adhere to specific behavioral and structural requirements.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Requirements**:\n    *   The core task is to detect a `TARGET_WIDTH`-bit sequence (`init`) in a serial input stream (`din`).\n    *   The module must be parameterized by `TARGET_WIDTH`.\n    *   A synchronous, active-low reset (`resetn`) is specified.\n    *   The target sequence `init` is loaded into an internal register on reset.\n    *   A shift register must maintain the last `TARGET_WIDTH` bits from `din`.\n    *   An output `seen` should pulse high for one clock cycle when the sequence in the shift register matches the target sequence.\n    *   Overlapping matches are allowed.\n    *   During reset, the shift register should be cleared, and `seen` should be low.\n    *   The `init` port is `TARGET_WIDTH` bits wide; the padding note refers to how users should prepare shorter conceptual targets.\n\n2.  **Module Definition**:\n    *   The module is named `model`.\n    *   It includes a parameter `TARGET_WIDTH` with a default value of 5.\n    *   Ports are defined as specified: `clk` (input logic), `resetn` (input logic), `init` (input logic `[TARGET_WIDTH-1:0]`), `din` (input logic), and `seen` (output logic).\n\n3.  **Internal State Elements**:\n    *   `target_reg`: A `logic` register of size `[TARGET_WIDTH-1:0]` to store the target sequence. This register is loaded with `init` when `resetn` is active (low) and holds its value otherwise.\n    *   `shift_reg`: A `logic` register of size `[TARGET_WIDTH-1:0]` to store the most recent `TARGET_WIDTH` bits from `din`. This register shifts in `din` on each clock cycle when `resetn` is inactive (high) and is cleared to all zeros when `resetn` is active.\n\n4.  **Reset Logic (Synchronous Active-Low)**:\n    *   All sequential logic is placed within an `always_ff @(posedge clk)` block.\n    *   The reset condition is checked synchronously: `if (!resetn)`.\n    *   During reset (`!resetn` is true):\n        *   `target_reg <= init;` (Loads the target sequence).\n        *   `shift_reg <= \'0;` (Clears the shift register. `\'0` implies all bits are set to 0).\n        *   `seen <= 1\'b0;` (Ensures `seen` is low during and immediately after reset).\n\n5.  **Operational Logic (when `resetn == 1`)**:\n    *   `target_reg`: This register retains its value loaded during the last reset, as there\'s no assignment to it in the `else` branch of the reset condition.\n    *   `shift_reg` Update: `shift_reg <= {shift_reg[TARGET_WIDTH-2:0], din};`. This implements a shift operation where `din` becomes the new least significant bit (LSB, index 0) of `shift_reg`, and all other bits shift one position towards the most significant bit (MSB). The previous MSB is discarded. This specific slicing `[TARGET_WIDTH-2:0]` correctly handles the case when `TARGET_WIDTH` is 1 (resulting in an empty slice, so `shift_reg <= din;`).\n    *   `seen` Update: `seen` is a registered output. It should be asserted if the new state of `shift_reg` (after the current bit `din` is shifted in) matches `target_reg`.\n        *   A temporary `logic` variable `shift_reg_updated_value` is used for clarity to represent the value `shift_reg` will take after the current clock edge: `logic [TARGET_WIDTH-1:0] shift_reg_updated_value = {shift_reg[TARGET_WIDTH-2:0], din};`.\n        *   The `seen` output is then assigned: `seen <= (shift_reg_updated_value == target_reg);`.\n        *   This logic ensures that `seen` becomes high in the same clock cycle that `shift_reg` is updated to match `target_reg`.\n\n6.  **`seen` Pulse Behavior and Overlapping Matches**:\n    *   The assignment `seen <= (shift_reg_updated_value == target_reg);` means `seen` will be high as long as the condition (match) is true at the rising clock edge.\n    *   If the target is `T=111` (for `TARGET_WIDTH=3`) and the input `din` sequence is `...011110...`:\n        *   When the third `1` of the first `111` sequence is shifted in, `shift_reg_updated_value` becomes `111`. `seen` becomes `1`.\n        *   In the next cycle, if `din` is `1` again, `shift_reg` (which was `111`) shifts, and `shift_reg_updated_value` becomes `111` again. `seen` remains `1`.\n        *   This behavior correctly implements "overlapping matches allowed" and ensures `seen` is asserted for "each detection". If detections are consecutive due to overlapping patterns (like `111` within `1111`), `seen` will remain asserted.\n    *   The term "pulse" means `seen` will return to low if the match condition is no longer met after a subsequent shift.\n\n7.  **`init` Padding Consideration**:\n    *   The specification mentions: "Treat shorter init values as zero-padded on the high side".\n    *   The module\'s `init` port is defined as `input logic [TARGET_WIDTH-1:0] init`.\n    *   If an external signal connected to `init` is narrower than `TARGET_WIDTH`, SystemVerilog\'s assignment rules for port connections will typically zero-extend the narrower signal to match the `TARGET_WIDTH`-bit width of the `init` port. For example, if `TARGET_WIDTH` is 5 and a 3-bit value `3\'b011` is driven to `init`, the `init` port inside the module will receive `5\'b00011`.\n    *   Therefore, no explicit padding logic is required within the `model` module itself for the `init` input; this is handled by the language rules at the point of instantiation/connection.\n\n8.  **Synthesizability and Comments**:\n    *   The code uses standard SystemVerilog constructs suitable for synthesis: `always_ff` for synchronous logic, non-blocking assignments (`<=`) for registers, and basic comparison/concatenation operations.\n    *   Comments are added to explain the module\'s functionality, parameters, ports, internal signals, and key logic sections, fulfilling the requirement for "clean, commented" code.', code="module model #(\n    parameter TARGET_WIDTH = 5 // Width of the target sequence and shift register\n) (\n    input  logic               clk,     // Clock signal\n    input  logic               resetn,  // Synchronous, active-low reset\n    input  logic [TARGET_WIDTH-1:0] init,// Target sequence, loaded on reset\n    input  logic               din,     // Serial input bit\n    output logic               seen     // Pulses high for one cycle when target is seen\n);\n\n    // Internal state registers\n    logic [TARGET_WIDTH-1:0] target_reg; // Stores the target sequence\n    logic [TARGET_WIDTH-1:0] shift_reg;  // Stores the most recent TARGET_WIDTH bits from din\n\n    // Sequential logic block\n    // Handles reset, target loading, data shifting, and sequence detection.\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin // Synchronous active-low reset\n            // Target loading: On reset, latch the 'init' value into target_reg.\n            target_reg <= init;\n\n            // Sequence reset: Clear the shift register.\n            shift_reg  <= '0; // Equivalent to {TARGET_WIDTH{1'b0}}\n\n            // Sequence reset: Drive 'seen' output to 0.\n            seen       <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            // Normal operation (resetn == 1)\n\n            // target_reg holds its value loaded during reset.
