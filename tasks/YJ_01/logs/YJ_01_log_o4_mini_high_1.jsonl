After convergence, the final material layout respects the loading/boundaries and uses 48% solid.  The computed compliance is the global work (UᵀF) given by twice the total strain energy in the final design.  Summing the final strain‐energy field and multiplying by 2 yields a compliance of approximately 53.47, and the final volume fraction stays at the prescribed 0.48.', config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=53.47, VF_y_hat=0.48)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'compliance_error': 'Fail (CE=9.1327)', 'volume_fraction_error': 'Pass (VFE=0.0000)'}, 'score': 30}
