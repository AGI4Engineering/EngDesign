{'completion_tokens': 478, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To derive an execution plan for the matrix multiplication on the IPU Mk2, we need to consider the constraints and capabilities of the hardware, as well as the requirements of the T10 benchmark. The matrix multiplication task is defined as C[m,n] += A[m,k]*B[k,n] with dimensions m=128, k=5120, and n=15360. The IPU Mk2 has 1472 cores, each with a 624KB scratchpad memory, and a high inter-core bandwidth.\\n\\n1. **Operator Partitioning (F_op):**\\n   - We need to partition the operator across the available cores.\\n   - A reasonable partitioning could be F_op = [2, 4, 8], which divides the dimensions m, k, and n respectively. This results in 2 * 4 * 8 = 64 sub-operators, which is manageable within the 1472 cores.\\n\\n2. **Temporal Partitioning (f_t):**\\n   - For tensor A, we can use f_t_A_m = 1 and f_t_A_k = 2, allowing for efficient use of the systolic array and alignment with the partitioning of k.\\n   - For tensor B, f_t_B_k = 2 and f_t_B_n = 4, aligning with the partitioning of n and allowing for efficient data flow.\\n   - For tensor C, f_t_C_m = 1 and f_t_C_n = 4, ensuring that the output tensor is computed efficiently.\\n\\n3. **Alignment and Constraints:**\\n   - The temporal factors must align across shared dimensions, ensuring that the compute-shift pattern is valid.\\n   - The chosen factors ensure that the sub-tensors fit within the per-core memory limits and that the inter-core communication is minimized.\\n\\nThis plan balances the memory footprint and communication overhead, leveraging the high inter-core bandwidth and the capabilities of the IPU Mk2.', config=ConfigFile(F_op=[2, 4, 8], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=2, f_t_B_k=2, f_t_B_n=4, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=4)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [2, 4, 8], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 2, 'f_t_B_k': 2, 'f_t_B_n': 4, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 4, 'score': 20, 't10_time': 28672, 'ai_time': -1, 'passed': False}, 'score': 20}
