{"completion_tokens": 910, "response": "reasoning=\"Based on the problem description, we need to define the execution plan for the matrix multiplication. The key parameters we need to define are the operator partition factors (F_op) and the temporal partition factors for each tensor (A, B, C) along each dimension (m, k, n). The goal is to utilize the 1472 cores of the IPU Mk2 efficiently while staying within the 624KB SRAM limit per core.\\n\\nA possible strategy is to partition the operator along all three dimensions (m, k, n) to maximize parallelism. The dimensions are m=128, k=5120, n=15360. Let's consider partitioning along m by a factor of 8, along k by a factor of 64, and along n by a factor of 3. This results in 8 * 64 * 3 = 1536 cores, which is slightly more than the available 1472 cores. We can scale down the partition factor on k to 60. So, the updated calculation is 8 * 60 * 3 = 1440. This utilizes less than the maximum allowed number of cores.\\n\\nTherefore, we choose F_op = [8, 60, 3].\\n\\nNow, we need to define the temporal partition factors. A simple approach would be to set all temporal partition factors to 1, meaning no temporal partitioning and each core directly computes its sub-task. Thus, f_t_A_m = 1, f_t_A_k = 1, f_t_B_k = 1, f_t_B_n = 1, f_t_C_m = 1, and f_t_C_n = 1. With these choices, sub-tensor sizes need to be checked if they will fit in the core memory.\\n\\nTensor A size: (128/8) * (5120/60) = 16 * 85.33.  Because each element is 2 bytes, the size for storing tensor A is approximately 16 * 86 * 2 = 2752 bytes.\\nTensor B size: (5120/60) * (15360/3) = 85.33 * 5120. The size for storing tensor B is approximately 86 * 5120 * 2 = 880640 bytes, which is more than the available 624KB per core. Thus, we should assign a temporal partition factor for this tensor to reduce the memory usage per core.\\n\\nLet's increase the temporal partition factor for tensor B on n by 2. f_t_B_n = 2. So tensor B now becomes (5120/60) * (15360/3)/2 = 85.33 * 2560, approximately 86 * 2560. Size = 86 * 2560 * 2 = 440320 bytes (440KB), which is less than the available 624KB.\\n\\nLet's partition temporal factors of other tensors in the common dimension. For the k dimension, f_t_A_k must be a factor or multiple of f_t_B_k = 1. So we keep f_t_A_k = 1. No constraints on other tensors.\\n\\nNow we have a valid execution plan.\" config=ConfigFile(F_op=[8, 60, 3], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=1, f_t_B_k=1, f_t_B_n=2, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)", "passed": true, "evaluation_result": {"F_op": [8, 60, 3], "f_t_A_m": 1, "f_t_A_k": 1, "f_t_B_k": 1, "f_t_B_n": 2, "f_t_C_m": 1, "f_t_C_n": 1, "score": 57.93011543846582, "t10_time": 28672, "ai_time": 321066.0, "passed": true}, "score": 57.93011543846582}
