The remaining dimension n is missing, so every A sub-tensor is required by 44 cores (F_n).  Replicating this 40 kB tile is affordable, hence choose f_t_A = [1,1].\n– Tensor B (k,n) is spatially sliced on k and n, missing m ⇒ shared by 4 cores.  Replication is also small enough → f_t_B = [1,1].\n– Tensor C (m,n) is fully determined by the core coordinates, no sharing needed → f_t_C = [1,1].\nAll temporal products (1) divide the corresponding sharing degree, so alignment constraints are satisfied.\n\nStep 4  Padding/throughput considerations\nAfter padding n from 15 360 to 15 488, every local sub-matrix (32×352, 640×352, 32×352) is a perfect multiple of the 16×16 MMA engine, so no extra intra-core padding is required and each core reaches peak throughput.\n\nStep 5  Cross-core reduction on k\nBecause F_k=8, every C tile is produced as eight partial sums.  A cheap ring-reduce (shift-and-add) along the k dimension finalises C.  The extra buffer needed is the already-allocated C_local, so memory safety is preserved.\n\nResulting execution plan:\n• Spatial operator partition\u2003F_op = [4, 8, 44]\n• Temporal factors            f_t_A_m = 1, f_t_A_k = 1\n                              f_t_B_k = 1, f_t_B_n = 1\n                              f_t_C_m = 1, f_t_C_n = 1\nThis plan uses 1 408 cores, fits in SRAM, aligns with the 16×16 systolic array, minimises communication by avoiding unnecessary shifts, and keeps total run time low.', config=ConfigFile(F_op=[4, 8, 44], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=1, f_t_B_k=1, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)), 'passed': np.True_, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [4, 8, 44], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 1, 'f_t_B_k': 1, 'f_t_B_n': 1, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 1, 'score': np.float64(82.87130413165335), 't10_time': 28672, 'ai_time': np.float64(56160.0), 'passed': np.True_}, 'score': np.float64(82.87130413165335)}
