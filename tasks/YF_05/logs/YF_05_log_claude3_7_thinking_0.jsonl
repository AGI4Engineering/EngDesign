Let me calculate the lengths of each member:\n- Member 1-2: L₁₂ = 1000 mm\n- Member 2-3: L₂₃ = 1000 mm\n- Member 1-3: L₁₃ = √(1000² + 1000²) = 1414.21 mm\n\nFor this structure, I can apply the direct stiffness method. After setting up the global stiffness matrix and applying boundary conditions, I can derive expressions for the nodal displacements.\n\nThe horizontal and vertical displacements at Node 3 are:\nu₃ = 4000 / (210*A₂₃)\nv₃ = -4000 / (210*A₂₃)\n\nThe magnitude of displacement at Node 3 is therefore:\n|δ₃| = √(u₃² + v₃²) = 4000 * √2 / (210*A₂₃)\n\nThe performance criterion states that the maximum nodal displacement must be less than 0.5mm, with optimal scoring when the ratio is between 70% and 90% of this threshold. \n\nFor 80% of the threshold (0.4mm), which is in the middle of the optimal range:\n0.4 = 4000 * √2 / (210*A₂₃)\n\nSolving for A₂₃:\n210*A₂₃ = 4000 * √2 / 0.4 = 10000 * √2 = 14142\nA₂₃ = 14142 / 210 = 67.3 mm²\n\nWith this cross-sectional area, the maximum displacement will be 80% of the allowable threshold, which falls within the optimal scoring range.", config=ConfigFile(Th=67.3)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'N': -4000.0, 'sigma': 59.43536404160476, 'sigma_lim': 250.0, 'max_disp': 0.4002585614867601, 'disp_thresh': 0.5}, 'score': 100.0}
