Thus the entire load is taken by the vertical member (2–3).\n\nStep 2: The axial deflection of member 2–3 is\n   δ = P·L/(A·E)\n     = 4000 N·1000 mm/(A mm²·210000 N/mm²)\n     = 19.05/A   (mm).\n\nStep 3: To satisfy δ < 0.5 mm, we need\n   A > 19.05/0.5 ≈ 38.1 mm².\n\nStep 4: To further target the “full‐score” region where δ is between 70% and 90% of the 0.5 mm limit (i.e. δ ≈ 0.35–0.45 mm), we pick δ ≈ 0.38 mm ⇒\n   A ≈ 19.05/0.38 ≈ 50 mm².\n\nStep 5: Therefore, choosing A = 50 mm² provides δ ≈ 0.38 mm (below the 0.5 mm limit with desirable margin) and sits in the 70–90% performance band.', config=ConfigFile(Th=50.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'N': -4000.0, 'sigma': 80.0, 'sigma_lim': 250.0, 'max_disp': 0.538748023761179, 'disp_thresh': 0.5}, 'score': 0.0}
