For a truss, the stiffness matrix relates forces to displacements. Each member contributes to the overall stiffness based on its area, modulus, and orientation.\n\nFor a 2D truss element, the element stiffness matrix is:\nk = (AE/L) * [cos²θ cosθsinθ -cos²θ -cosθsinθ; cosθsinθ sin²θ -cosθsinθ -sin²θ; -cos²θ -cosθsinθ cos²θ cosθsinθ; -cosθsinθ -sin²θ cosθsinθ sin²θ]\n\nWhere:\n- A is the cross-sectional area\n- E is Young's modulus\n- L is the element length\n- θ is the angle between the element and the x-axis\n\nLet's calculate the properties of each member:\n\nMember 1-2:\n- Length = 1000mm\n- θ = 0°\n- A = 100mm²\n\nMember 1-3:\n- Length = √(1000² + 1000²) = 1414.21mm\n- θ = 45°\n- A = 100mm²\n\nMember 2-3:\n- Length = 1000mm\n- θ = 90°\n- A = to be determined\n\nThe maximum displacement will occur at Node 3, which has the applied load. I need to ensure that √(ux² + uy²) < 0.5mm.\n\nSince the scoring is optimized when the maximum displacement is 70-90% of the threshold, I'll aim for around 80% of 0.5mm, which is 0.4mm.\n\nFor a vertical member (2-3) with a vertical load at Node 3, the relationship between area and displacement is approximately:\nδy ≈ F·L/(A·E)\n\nRearranging to solve for A:\nA ≈ F·L/(E·δy)\n\nA ≈ 4000N · 1000mm / (210000MPa · 0.4mm)\nA ≈ 4000 · 1000 / (210000 · 0.4)\nA ≈ 4000000 / 84000\nA ≈ 47.62mm²\n\nHowever, this is a simplified calculation. In reality, Node 3 can also displace horizontally, and the other members contribute to the overall stiffness. Due to the truss configuration, I need to account for load distribution across all members.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'll select a cross-sectional area of 50mm² for the member between Node 2 and Node 3. This should provide sufficient stiffness to keep the maximum displacement below the 0.5mm threshold while aiming for the optimal scoring range (70-90% of the threshold).", config=ConfigFile(Th=50.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'N': -4000.0, 'sigma': 80.0, 'sigma_lim': 250.0, 'max_disp': 0.538748023761179, 'disp_thresh': 0.5}, 'score': 0.0}
