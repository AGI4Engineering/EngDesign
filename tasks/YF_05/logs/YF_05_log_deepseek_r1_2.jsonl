{'completion_tokens': 9850, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The task requires determining the cross-sectional area (A) of member 2-3 in a 2D truss to limit maximum nodal displacement to <0.5 mm. The truss geometry and loading create a vertical force at Node 3. Using static analysis and stiffness matrices for linear-elastic truss elements, the vertical displacement at Node 3 is derived as δ = 4000 / (210A). To achieve δ_max < 0.5 mm, A must be >38.1 mm². For optimal scoring (δ_max between 70-90% of 0.5 mm), A should be between 42.33-54.42 mm². Selecting A=50 mm² ensures δ_max≈0.38 mm (76.2% of threshold), safely within the full-score range while balancing material efficiency and stiffness.', config=ConfigFile(Th=50.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'N': -4000.0, 'sigma': 80.0, 'sigma_lim': 250.0, 'max_disp': 0.538748023761179, 'disp_thresh': 0.5}, 'score': 0.0}
