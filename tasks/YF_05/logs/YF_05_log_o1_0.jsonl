{'completion_tokens': 4808, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Below is a concise hand‐calculation showing why the vertical bar alone carries the 4\u202fkN vertical load and how its chosen cross‐sectional area governs the top-node displacement.\n\n1. In this right‐triangle layout, Node\xa01 is fully fixed and Node\xa02 is fixed in the vertical direction (uy=0) but free to move horizontally. A free‐body analysis reveals that neither the horizontal bottom member (Node\xa01→Node\xa02) nor the diagonal (Node\xa01→Node\xa03) carries load, leaving the vertical bar (Node\xa02→Node\xa03) to take the entire 4\u202fkN.\n\n2. The axial deformation Δ of this vertical member is given by:\n   Δ = (N·L) / (E·A),\n   where\n   – N = 4000\u202fN,\n   – L = 1000\u202fmm,\n   – E = 210\u202f000\u202fN/mm²,\n   – A is the cross‐sectional area sought.\n   Substituting numbers yields\n   Δ = (4000×1000) / (210\u202f000 × A) ≈ (19.05\u202fmm)/A.\n\n3. Requiring Δ < 0.5\u202fmm implies\n   (19.05\u202fmm)/A < 0.5\u202fmm  →  A > 38.1\u202fmm².\n\n4. To keep the deflection ratio δ/δ_limit between 70% and 90% (as per the scoring guidelines), one can choose A between about 42 and 54\u202fmm². Taking a neat, conservative round figure such as A = 50\u202fmm² keeps δ comfortably in this target band.\n\nJustification:\n• If A is too small, node 3’s displacement rises above the 0.5\u202fmm limit.\n• A moderate area (roughly 50\u202fmm²) ensures sufficient axial stiffness to keep the vertical displacement well under the requirement.\n• The other two members carry no net load in this particular boundary/support layout, so the vertical member’s stiffness alone controls the deflection at Node 3.\n', config=ConfigFile(Th=50.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'N': -4000.0, 'sigma': 80.0, 'sigma_lim': 250.0, 'max_disp': 0.538748023761179, 'disp_thresh': 0.5}, 'score': 0.0}
