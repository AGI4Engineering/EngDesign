I'll analyze the forces in each member using equilibrium equations.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the length of each member:\n- Member 1 (Node 1→2): L₁ = 1000 mm\n- Member 2 (Node 2→3): L₂ = 1000 mm\n- Member 3 (Node 1→3): L₃ = √(1000² + 1000²) = 1414.21 mm\n\nStep 2: Set up the global stiffness matrix for the truss.\nFor a truss element, the stiffness is k = (EA/L)\n\nStep 3: For a simplified approach, I'll use the principle that in a truss, the deflection is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Since we need to keep the maximum displacement below 0.5mm, and we want it to be between 70% and 90% of the allowable threshold for optimal scoring (i.e., between 0.35mm and 0.45mm), I need to ensure sufficient stiffness.\n\nStep 4: From the geometry and loading, I can see that member 2→3 will primarily resist the vertical 4000N load. Given that this vertical member directly carries the load, its area will significantly impact the vertical displacement of Node 3.\n\nStep 5: Using the basic relationship that displacement δ = PL/AE for an axial member:\nFor member 2→3:\nδ ≈ PL/AE = (4000 N × 1000 mm)/(A × 210,000 MPa)\n\nIf we target a displacement around 0.4mm (80% of threshold):\n0.4 mm ≈ (4000 × 1000)/(A × 210,000)\nA ≈ (4000 × 1000)/(0.4 × 210,000)\nA ≈ 47.62 mm²\n\nStep 6: However, this is an approximation as it doesn't account for the full truss behavior. The actual system is more complex since Node 3 can move horizontally as well. To ensure we have sufficient stiffness while staying within the optimal range, I'll increase this value to account for the system complexity.\n\nA reasonable value would be approximately 50 mm². This provides adequate stiffness to keep displacements within the 70-90% range of the allowable threshold (0.35-0.45mm) while not overdesigning the structure.\n\nTherefore, I recommend a cross-sectional area of 50 mm² for the member between Node 2 and Node 3.", config=ConfigFile(Th=50.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'N': -4000.0, 'sigma': 80.0, 'sigma_lim': 250.0, 'max_disp': 0.538748023761179, 'disp_thresh': 0.5}, 'score': 0.0}
