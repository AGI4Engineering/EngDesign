So, (400\u221a2)/(21A) < 0.5.\\n  A > (400\u221a2)/(21*0.5) = (800\u221a2)/21 \u2248 53.874 mm\u00b2.\\n\\n  Scoring: The problem states 'The score depends on the ratio of the maximum measured angle to the allowable threshold.' This is ambiguous as no angle is defined. It's assumed 'angle' is a typo for 'displacement', and scoring refers to R_disp = \u03b4_N3 / 0.5.\\n  R_disp = ((400\u221a2)/(21A)) / 0.5 = (800\u221a2)/(21A) \u2248 53.874/A.\\n  Scoring rules for R_disp:\\n    - 0.7 \u2264 R_disp \u2264 0.9: 100 points.\\n    - R_disp < 0.7: Score = 100 * (R_disp/0.7).\\n    - 0.9 < R_disp \u2264 1.0: Score = 1000 * (1-R_disp).\\n    - R_disp > 1.0 or R_disp < 0: Score = 0.\\n\\n  To maximize score, aim for R_disp in [0.7, 0.9]. Let's choose a value of A that achieves this. For example, if we target the middle of this range, R_disp = 0.8.\\n  A = 53.874 / 0.8 \u2248 67.343 mm\u00b2.\\n  Let's choose A = 70 mm\u00b2 for simplicity and to ensure it's well within the optimal range.\\n  For A = 70 mm\u00b2:\\n    R_disp = 53.874 / 70 \u2248 0.7696. This is in [0.7, 0.9], yielding 100 points.\\n    \u03b4_N3 = R_disp * 0.5 = 0.7696 * 0.5 \u2248 0.3848 mm. This satisfies \u03b4_N3 < 0.5 mm.\\n\\nStep 3: Determine 'Th' for JSON output\\n  The schema requires 'Th' in mm, described as 'The proposed thickness of the L-beam'.\\n  We have determined the optimal Area A = 70 mm\u00b2.\\n  Assume member 2-3 is an L-beam with equal leg lengths L_leg and thickness Th.\\n  The area of such an L-beam is A = Th * (2*L_leg - Th).\\n  We need to choose Th and L_leg such that A = 70 mm\u00b2 and the L-beam profile is reasonable.\\n  Let's choose Th = 2 mm.\\n  Then 70 = 2 * (2*L_leg - 2) => 35 = 2*L_leg - 2 => 2*L_leg = 37 => L_leg = 18.5 mm.\\n  This results in an L-beam of 18.5mm x 18.5mm with 2mm thickness. The ratio L_leg/Th = 18.5/2 = 9.25 is reasonable.\\n  Thus, the proposed Th = 2 mm.\\n\\nStep 4: Justification for the choice of Th (which implies A)\\n  The proposed thickness Th = 2 mm corresponds to an L-beam (18.5mm x 18.5mm legs) with a cross-sectional area A = 70 mm\u00b2 for member 2-3.\\n  This choice is justified because:\\n  1. Stiffness & Displacement: This area A = 70 mm\u00b2 results in a maximum nodal displacement \u03b4_N3 \u2248 0.3848 mm. This is safely below the 0.5 mm limit.\\n  2. Scoring: The displacement ratio R_disp = \u03b4_N3 / 0.5 \u2248 0.7696. This value lies within the [0.7, 0.9] range, which is expected to yield the maximum score according to the provided scoring criteria (assuming 'angle' refers to 'displacement ratio').\\n  3. Loading: The analysis considers the 4000 N vertical load at Node 3 and standard linear-elastic material behavior (E=210,000 MPa).\\n  4. Geometric Constraints: The truss geometry and boundary conditions are fully accounted for in the FEM model.\\n  5. Schema Compliance: The value Th = 2 mm directly fits the schema requirement for a thickness in mm and its description as 'thickness of an L-beam'.\" config=ConfigFile(Th=2.0)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"N": -4000.0, "sigma": 2000.0, "sigma_lim": 250.0, "max_disp": 13.468700594029476, "disp_thresh": 0.5}, "score": 0.0}
