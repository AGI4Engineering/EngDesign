The scoring is optimized when the maximum displacement is 70-90% of the threshold (0.35-0.45mm).\n\nFirst, let me understand the truss structure:\n- 3 nodes forming a right triangle\n- Node 1 at (0,0) - fixed in x and y directions\n- Node 2 at (1000,0) - fixed in y direction only\n- Node 3 at (1000,1000) - free\n- 4000 N downward force at Node 3\n- Member 1-2: A = 100mm²\n- Member 1-3: A = 100mm²\n- Member 2-3: Cross-sectional area to be determined\n\nI'll solve this using structural analysis principles. For a linear elastic truss, the displacement of each node relates to the stiffness of the structure and the applied loads: F = K·d where F is the force vector, K is the global stiffness matrix, and d is the displacement vector.\n\nThe stiffness of each member depends on:\n- Young's modulus E = 210,000 MPa\n- Cross-sectional area A\n- Member length L\n- Member orientation angle θ\n\nThe stiffness contribution of a member is: k = (E·A/L)·[cos²θ, cosθ·sinθ, -cos²θ, -cosθ·sinθ; cosθ·sinθ, sin²θ, -cosθ·sinθ, -sin²θ; -cos²θ, -cosθ·sinθ, cos²θ, cosθ·sinθ; -cosθ·sinθ, -sin²θ, cosθ·sinθ, sin²θ]\n\nFor our members:\n- Member 1-2: L = 1000mm, θ = 0°\n- Member 1-3: L = √(1000² + 1000²) = 1414.21mm, θ = 45°\n- Member 2-3: L = 1000mm, θ = 90°\n\nNow, let's think about which node will have the maximum displacement. Due to the loading and constraints, Node 3 will experience the largest displacement, primarily in the vertical direction.\n\nI'll approach this analytically. The vertical displacement at Node 3 will be inversely proportional to the stiffness of the structure. Since Members 1-2 and 1-3 have fixed areas, the main variable affecting stiffness is the area of Member 2-3.\n\nMember 2-3 directly supports the vertical load at Node 3, so its area will have a significant impact on the vertical displacement. For a vertical member under axial load, the axial deformation is:\nδ = P·L/(E·A)\n\nWhere:\n- P is the axial force (close to 4000N in this case)\n- L is the member length (1000mm)\n- E is Young's modulus (210,000 MPa)\n- A is the cross-sectional area (what we're solving for)\n\nRearranging to solve for A when δ is at our target range (let's aim for 0.4mm, which is 80% of the threshold):\nA = P·L/(E·δ) = 4000N·1000mm/(210,000MPa·0.4mm) = 47.62mm²\n\nThis is a simplified calculation that doesn't account for the full truss behavior, but it gives us a starting estimate. In reality, some of the load will be carried by the diagonal member 1-3, so we might need a slightly larger area.\n\nTo be conservative and ensure we're within the optimal 70-90% range of the displacement threshold, I'll choose a slightly higher value: A = 50mm² for the member between Node 2 and Node 3.\n\nThis value:\n1. Should provide sufficient stiffness to keep displacements within 70-90% of the 0.5mm threshold\n2. Is efficient in terms of material usage\n3.
