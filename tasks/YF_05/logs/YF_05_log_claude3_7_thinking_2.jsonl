{'completion_tokens': 33903, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I analyzed the truss structure and determined that the optimal cross-sectional area for the member connecting Node 2 to Node 3 should keep the maximum displacement within 70-90% of the 0.5mm threshold. Using the stiffness method, I calculated the vertical stiffness contribution from both Member 2 (vertical) and Member 3 (diagonal). For the vertical member, the stiffness is k_v2 = (E×A2/L2) = 210×A2 N/mm. For the diagonal member, k_v3 = 7424.6 N/mm. Aiming for a displacement of 0.4mm (80% of threshold), I set up the equation: 4000 = (210×A2 + 7424.6)×0.4, which gives A2 = 12.26mm². This provides sufficient stiffness while keeping the displacement in the optimal scoring range.', config=ConfigFile(Th=12.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'N': -3999.9999999999986, 'sigma': 333.3333333333332, 'sigma_lim': 250.0, 'max_disp': 2.244783432338245, 'disp_thresh': 0.5}, 'score': 0.0}
