{'completion_tokens': 1635, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Identify the load path and axial forces at Node 3:\n   - Two truss members meet at Node 3: the vertical member (2→3) and the 45° member (1→3).\n   - There is no horizontal external load, so the 45° member carries essentially zero axial force. The entire 4000 N vertical load must be carried by the vertical member.\n\n2. Express the vertical deflection δ of Node 3 in terms of the cross-sectional area A of member 2→3:\n   - δ = FL/(AE), where F=4000 N, L=1000 mm, E=210 000 N/mm².\n   - δ = (4000×1000)/(A×210 000) mm = 4×10⁶/(210 000 A) ≈ 19.05/A (mm).\n\n3. Impose the performance criterion δ ≤ 0.5 mm:\n   - 19.05/A ≤ 0.5 → A ≥ 19.05/0.5 ≈ 38.1 mm².\n\n4. Choose a practical design value with margin and to match the other members (which are 100 mm²):\n   - Selecting A = 50 mm² yields δ ≈ 19.05/50 = 0.381 mm < 0.5 mm, giving a safety margin and a performance‐ratio of 0.381/0.5 = 76.2%, comfortably within the 70–90% “full‐score” band.\n\n5. Map the chosen cross-sectional area to the schema’s “Th” field (interpreting thickness per unit width equivalent to A in mm²):\n   - Th = 50', config=ConfigFile(Th=50.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'N': -4000.0, 'sigma': 80.0, 'sigma_lim': 250.0, 'max_disp': 0.538748023761179, 'disp_thresh': 0.5}, 'score': 0.0}
