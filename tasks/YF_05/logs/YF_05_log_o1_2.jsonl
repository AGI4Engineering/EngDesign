{'completion_tokens': 5698, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Below is a short approximate hand‐calculation illustrating why about 50\xa0mm² is a suitable choice:\n\n1) From static equilibrium about Node\xa01, the entire 4000\xa0N load is carried vertically by the member from Node\xa02 to Node\xa03 (the member we are sizing). The diagonal and horizontal links carry negligible load in this ideal pinned layout.\n\n2) If F=4000\xa0N, length L=1000\xa0mm, Young’s modulus E=210000\xa0N/mm², and cross‐sectional area A is our design variable, the axial extension of that member is Δ = (F\xa0⋅\xa0L)/(E\xa0⋅\xa0A).\n\n   Numerically:  Δ[mm] = (4000\xa0×\xa01000) / (210000\xa0×\xa0A)\n                  = 19.05 / A,  with A in mm².\n\n3) We want Δ < 0.5\xa0mm to meet the requirement δ<0.5\xa0mm, but for best scoring we also want the ratio δ/0.5 near 70–90%.  That means Δ around 0.35–0.45\xa0mm.\n\n4) Solving 19.05/A ≈ 0.4 → A ≈ 48\xa0mm².  Picking a simple rounded area such as 50\xa0mm² will keep Δ at about 0.38\xa0mm, comfortably below 0.5\xa0mm and within the target 70–90% range.\n\nTherefore, a good choice of cross‐sectional area for the member between Node\xa02 and Node\xa03 is around 50\xa0mm².  This provides sufficient stiffness to keep displacements below the 0.5\xa0mm threshold and avoids oversizing.\n', config=ConfigFile(Th=50.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'N': -4000.0, 'sigma': 80.0, 'sigma_lim': 250.0, 'max_disp': 0.538748023761179, 'disp_thresh': 0.5}, 'score': 0.0}
