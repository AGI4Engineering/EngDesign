Historically, the folded-cascode topology has been favored in low-voltage applications due to its ability to provide high output impedance and large voltage swings. The motivation for this task stems from the need to design an OTA that meets stringent performance specifications, such as high DC gain, wide unity-gain frequency, and adequate phase margin, while operating within a limited power budget. The design also needs to ensure a wide input common-mode range, which is crucial for robust performance in varying operating conditions.', objectives=['Design a folded-cascode OTA with specified performance metrics.', 'Ensure the OTA operates within a power budget of 150 µA total DC current.', 'Verify the OTA meets the input common-mode range requirements.'], significance='Successfully designing a folded-cascode OTA with these specifications will enable the development of high-performance analog circuits that can operate efficiently in low-voltage environments, which is essential for modern portable and battery-operated devices.'), task_analysis=TaskAnalysis(task_description='The task involves designing a folded-cascode operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) that includes the folded-cascode and its bias current.
