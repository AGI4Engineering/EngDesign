Historically, the folded-cascode topology has been favored in low-voltage applications due to its ability to provide high gain without requiring a high supply voltage. The motivation for this task stems from the need to design an OTA that meets specific performance criteria, such as DC gain, unity-gain frequency, and phase margin, while operating within a constrained power budget.
