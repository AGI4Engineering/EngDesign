Historically, OTAs have been used in a variety of applications, including data converters, filters, and amplifiers. The motivation for designing a folded-cascode OTA lies in its ability to provide a high gain while maintaining a wide output swing, which is essential for modern analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. The folded-cascode topology is particularly advantageous in low-voltage applications, as it allows for a higher output voltage swing compared to traditional cascode structures.
