{"completion_tokens": 637, "response": "reasoning=\"Okay, I need to generate a Spectre netlist for a folded cascode OTA based on the provided specifications. Here's the breakdown of how I'll approach this, including device sizing and adherence to all the rules.\\n\\n1.  **Netlist Structure:** The netlist must strictly follow the provided template format, including the header comments, subcircuit definition, and footer comments with the top-level instance. No extra text or markdown is allowed.\\n2.  **Device Models:** All PMOS transistors must use `tsmc18dP`, and all NMOS transistors must use `tsmc18dN`.\\n3.  **Port Usage:** The pins `vin`, `vip`, `vout`, `VSS`, `VDD`, and `ibn10u` must be explicitly used in the transistor gate connections within the `fc_ota` subcircuit.\\n4.  **Technology Lock:**  The lengths of transistors are typical, around 180nm. Device widths will be determined based on the design requirements.\\n5. **Folded Cascode Topology**: the current source is NMOS; differential pair is NMOS; current mirror is PMOS. \\n\\nHere's the generated Spectre netlist based on these considerations:\" config=ConfigFile(netlist='// Library name: MP4\\n// Cell name: fc_ota\\n// View name: schematic\\nsubckt fc_ota VDD VSS ibn10u vin vip vout\\n    M0 (net1 ibn10u VSS VSS) tsmc18dN w=10u l=0.18u m=1\\n    M1 (net2 vin VSS VSS) tsmc18dN w=20u l=0.18u m=1\\n    M2 (net3 vip VSS VSS) tsmc18dN w=20u l=0.18u m=1\\n    M3 (net4 net1 VDD VDD) tsmc18dP w=30u l=0.18u m=1\\n    M4 (net4 net1 VDD VDD) tsmc18dP w=30u l=0.18u m=1\\n    M5 (vout net2 net4 VDD) tsmc18dP w=40u l=0.18u m=1\\n    M6 (vout net3 net4 VDD) tsmc18dP w=40u l=0.18u m=1\\nends fc_ota\\n// Top-level instantiation\\n// Library name: MP4\\n// Cell name: dut\\n// View name: schematic\\nI1 (net1 net2 net5 net3 net4 net6) fc_ota\\n')", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"error": "one or more metrics missing", "metrics": {"dc_gain_db": -425.67, "ugf_mhz": 0.0, "pm_deg": null, "icmr_v": 0.0, "io_err_mv": 800.0, "idc_ua": 0.0}, "score": 0, "passed": false}, "score": 0}
