{"completion_tokens": 4264, "response": "reasoning='To create a folded-cascode OTA that meets the sizing and format requirements, I proceeded as follows:\\n\\n1. Chose a 10 \u00b5A tail current source (Mtail) by sizing an NMOS device (W=100 \u00b5m, L=0.18 \u00b5m) whose gate is tied to the bias pin ibn10u and whose source is at VSS.\\n2. Built the differential input pair (M1/M2) as NMOS transistors (W=20 \u00b5m, L=0.18 \u00b5m) whose sources connect to the tail node ntail, gates to vin/vip, and drains to the cascode nodes n1/n2.\\n3. Used PMOS cascode load devices (P1/P2) (W=40 \u00b5m, L=0.18 \u00b5m) diode-connected (gate tied to source at VDD) to provide high output impedance at n1/n2.\\n4. Implemented an NMOS current mirror (M3/M4) (W=40 \u00b5m, L=0.18 \u00b5m): M3 is diode-connected between node n1 and VSS to generate the mirror bias, and M4 sinks the mirrored current from the secondary cascode node (n2) into the output node vout.\\n5. Ensured all model names are exactly tsmc18dN/tsmc18dP, and that pins VDD, VSS, ibn10u, vin, vip, vout appear verbatim.\\n6. Followed the exact netlist header/footer and subcircuit naming/template, and mapped the six top-level nets in the instantiation I1 to (VDD, VSS, ibn10u, vin, vip, vout).\\n\\nThis folded-cascode arrangement (10 \u00b5A tail current, cascoded loads, and current-mirror output) provides a balance of DC gain and bandwidth while respecting the 1.4 V supply and 1 pF load.
