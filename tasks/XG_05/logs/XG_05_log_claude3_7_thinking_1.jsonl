I'll use the SIMC (Simplified Internal Model Control) tuning method, which works well for systems with significant delay.\n\nFor a PI controller with transfer function C(s) = Kp + Ki/s = (Kp·s + Ki)/s and our requirements:\n- Gain margin ≥ 7 dB\n- Phase margin ≥ 60 degrees\n- Overshoot ≤ 10%\n- Settling time ≤ 150 s\n\nUsing the SIMC method with a closed-loop time constant τc = 30 s:\nKp = (τ)/(τc + θ) = 13/(30 + 23) = 13/53 = 0.2453\nTi = min(τ, 4(τc + θ)) = min(13, 4(53)) = 13\nKi = Kp/Ti = 0.2453/13 = 0.0189\n\nThis gives a controller with transfer function:\nC(s) = (0.2453s + 0.0189)/s\n\nThis controller will provide:\n- Adequate stability margins (both gain and phase margins)\n- Limited overshoot due to the conservative tuning\n- Settling time within requirements (approximately 4τc = 120 s)\n\nTherefore, the numerator coefficients are [0.2453, 0.0189] and denominator coefficients are [1, 0].", config=ConfigFile(theta=23.0, tau=13.0, num=[0.2453, 0.0189], den=[1.0, 0.0])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'theta': 23.0, 'tau': 13.0, 'overshoot': 0.8029205874642509, 'settling_time': 104.74526760882024, 'gain_margin': 11.160355053085379, 'phase_margin': 65.07421819039148}, 'score': 80.0}
