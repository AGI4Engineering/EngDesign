Several controller designs could fulfill these criteria.\\nFor simplicity, consider a proportional-integral (PI) controller, with the transfer function Kc*(1 + 1/(Ti*s)). The values of Kc and Ti are to be tuned.\\n\\nTo achieve a gain margin >= 7 dB and phase margin >= 60 degrees, an optimization approach (using the process model identified above) is a good one, but as this is beyond the scope, a simple design for this example will be a PI controller with:\\nKc = 0.5\\nTi = 20 s\\nThen the transfer function of the controller is 0.5 * (1 + 1/(20*s)) = (0.5s + 0.025)/s, the numerator is [0.5, 0.025] and the denominator is [1, 0]' config=ConfigFile(theta=23.0, tau=13.0, num=[0.5, 0.025], den=[1.0, 0.0])", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"theta": 23.0, "tau": 13.0, "overshoot": 3.875618905969813, "settling_time": 137.5653283531593, "gain_margin": 7.540675533684967, "phase_margin": 63.682019836796584}, "score": 80.0}
