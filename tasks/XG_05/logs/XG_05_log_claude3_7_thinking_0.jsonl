I'll use the IMC-PID tuning method which works well for such systems.\n\nFor a system G(s) = e^(-θs)/(1+τs), the IMC-PID tuning formulas are:\nKc = (τ+θ/2)/(K·(λ+θ/2))\nTi = τ + θ/2\nTd = τ·θ/(2τ+θ)\n\nWhere:\n- K is the steady-state gain (K=1 in our normalized case)\n- λ is the tuning parameter (I'll use λ = θ = 16.5 for robustness)\n\nCalculating the parameters:\nKc = (19.5+16.5/2)/(1·(16.5+16.5/2)) = 27.75/24.75 = 1.12\nTi = 19.5 + 16.5/2 = 27.75\nTd = 19.5·16.5/(2·19.5+16.5) = 321.75/55.5 = 5.8\n\nConverting to standard PID form:\nKp = 1.12\nKi = Kp/Ti = 1.12/27.75 = 0.04\nKd = Kp·Td = 1.12·5.8 = 6.5\n\nSo the controller transfer function is:\nC(s) = Kp + Ki/s + Kd·s = (6.5s² + 1.12s + 0.04)/s\n\nThis controller should meet all specifications:\n- The gain and phase margins should exceed requirements due to the conservative IMC tuning\n- Overshoot should be less than 10% with our phase margin\n- Settling time should be well within 150s as our closed-loop time constant is approximately 25s", config=ConfigFile(theta=16.5, tau=19.5, num=[6.5, 1.12, 0.04], den=[1.0, 0.0])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'theta': 16.5, 'tau': 19.5, 'overshoot': 0.0, 'settling_time': 73.05564118595363, 'gain_margin': 7.337906971869926, 'phase_margin': 69.40174938173112}, 'score': 100.0}
