The time constant τ can be calculated from t₁ and t₂ using: τ = (t₂ - t₁)/0.7337\n2. The delay time θ can be found using: θ = t₂ - τ\n\nCalculating τ:\nτ = (36 - 23)/0.7337 = 13/0.7337 = 17.72 seconds\n\nCalculating θ:\nθ = t₂ - τ = 36 - 17.72 = 18.28 seconds\n\nTherefore, the transfer function is:\nG(s) = e^(-18.28s)/(1+17.72s)\n\n## Task 2: Design Feedback Controller\n\nBased on the identified model G(s) = e^(-18.28s)/(1+17.72s), I need to design a controller that meets the specified requirements:\n- Gain margin ≥ 7 dB\n- Phase margin ≥ 60°\n- Overshoot ≤ 10%\n- Settling time ≤ 150 s\n\nA PID controller with the structure C(s) = Kp + Ki/s + Kd·s is appropriate for this system. However, due to the significant delay in the system, a standard PID might not perform optimally. I'll consider a PI controller with filter, which is often effective for first-order plus delay systems.\n\nFor a system with significant delay, a good starting point is to use a PI controller. For a first-order system with delay, we can use the Internal Model Control (IMC) method to design the controller.\n\nThe transfer function for a PI controller is:\nC(s) = Kp(1 + 1/(Ti·s))\n\nFor a system with time constant τ and delay θ, IMC tuning suggests:\nKp = τ/(K·(λ + θ))\nTi = τ\n\nwhere K is the process gain (1 in this case) and λ is a tuning parameter that affects the closed-loop response speed.\n\nFor a conservative design that ensures stability margins:\nλ = 0.5·θ = 0.5·18.28 = 9.14\n\nTherefore:\nKp = 17.72/(1·(9.14 + 18.28)) = 17.72/27.42 = 0.646\nTi = 17.72\n\nThe PI controller transfer function is:\nC(s) = 0.646·(1 + 1/(17.72·s)) = 0.646 + 0.036·(1/s)\n\nConverting to polynomial form:\nC(s) = (0.646·s + 0.036)/s\n\nThis gives us the numerator = [0.646, 0.036] and denominator = [1, 0]\n\nHowever, to improve phase margin and handling of the delay, I'll add a low-pass filter to the PI controller:\nC(s) = (0.646·s + 0.036)/(s·(1 + β·s))\n\nwhere β = 0.1·Ti = 1.772\n\nThis gives us:\nC(s) = (0.646·s + 0.036)/(s·(1 + 1.772·s))\n\nSimplifying:\nC(s) = (0.646·s + 0.036)/(s + 1.772·s²)\n\nTherefore, the final controller has:\nNumerator = [0.646, 0.036]\nDenominator = [1.772, 1, 0]\n\nThis controller should meet all the specified requirements, with:\n- Robust stability (gain margin > 7dB and phase margin > 60°)\n- Controlled overshoot (≤ 10%)\n- Settling time within 150 seconds", config=ConfigFile(theta=18.28, tau=17.72, num=[0.646, 0.036], den=[1.772, 1.0, 0.0])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'theta': 18.28, 'tau': 17.72, 'overshoot': 22.331747629634503, 'settling_time': 147.90768329596463, 'gain_margin': 6.800632071212301, 'phase_margin': 48.904743947027214}, 'score': 40.0}
