Most importantly, I need to decrease the energy attenuation significantly.\n\nBeta controls the trade-off between suspension deflection (Wsd) and body acceleration (Wab). A higher beta will prioritize minimizing suspension deflection, while a lower beta will prioritize minimizing body acceleration.\n\nSince I need to reduce RMS body travel (which is related to comfort) while being able to accept higher peaks, I should increase beta. This will prioritize suspension deflection more, which should improve the overall body travel characteristics. At the same time, this should reduce the energy attenuation as we're making different trade-offs.\n\nI'll choose a beta value of 0.03, which is 3 times the original value. This should significantly change the controller behavior while still maintaining a reasonable balance between objectives.", config=ConfigFile(A=[[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [-53.333, -3.333, 53.333, 3.333], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], [266.667, 16.667, -3433.333, -16.667]], B=[[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 3.333], [0.0, 0.0], [3166.667, -16.667]], beta=0.03)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'A_correct': True, 'B_correct': True, 'rms_correct': False, 'peak_correct': True, 'attenuation_correct': True, 'rms': 0.014036200592404983, 'peak': 0.03094028474137536, 'attenuation': 0.5749531333676389}, 'score': 80.0}
