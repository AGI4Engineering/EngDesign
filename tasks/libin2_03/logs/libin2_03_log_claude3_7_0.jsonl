Let me solve this step by step.\n\n### Given Information:\n- Partition size: 1 TB = 1,000,000,000 KB\n- Total number of files: 1,000,000\n- P_small(T) = 0.8 × (1 − exp(− T / 4.1)) - proportion of small files\n- avg_small_kb(T) = 2 + 0.05 × T - average size of small files in KB\n- avg_large_kb(T) = 512 + 0.50 × T - average size of large files in KB\n\n### Requirements:\n1. Fragmentation overhead ≤ 0.5% (0.005)\n2. Metadata overhead ≤ 0.05% (0.0005)\n\n### Step 1: Establish the relationship between variables\nLet's define:\n- C = cluster size in KB\n- T = small-file threshold in KB\n- N_small = number of small files = 1,000,000 × P_small(T)\n- N_large = number of large files = 1,000,000 × (1 - P_small(T))\n\n### Step 2: Calculate fragmentation overhead\nThe average wasted space per file is:\n- For small files: W_small = C - 2 KB\n- For large files: W_large = C/2\n\nTotal wasted space = (N_small × W_small) + (N_large × W_large)\nFragmentation overhead = Total wasted space / Partition size\n\nFragmentation overhead = [(N_small × (C - 2)) + (N_large × C/2)] / 1,000,000,000\n\n### Step 3: Calculate metadata overhead\nEach cluster requires 4 bytes = 0.004 KB of mapping information.\n\nNumber of clusters for small files = N_small × (avg_small_kb(T) / C) (rounded up per file)\nNumber of clusters for large files = N_large × (avg_large_kb(T) / C) (rounded up per file)\n\nFor simplification, I'll approximate the number of clusters needed:\n- Small files: N_small × ⌈avg_small_kb(T) / C⌉ ≈ N_small\n- Large files: N_large × ⌈avg_large_kb(T) / C⌉ ≈ N_large × (avg_large_kb(T) / C)\n\nTotal metadata size = 0.004 KB × (N_small + N_large × avg_large_kb(T) / C)\nMetadata overhead = Total metadata size / Partition size\n\n### Step 4: Try different values for C and T\nLet me try T = 8 KB and C = 4 KB as initial values:\n\nP_small(8) = 0.8 × (1 − exp(− 8 / 4.1)) ≈ 0.8 × (1 - 0.143) ≈ 0.8 × 0.857 ≈ 0.686\n\nN_small = 1,000,000 × 0.686 = 686,000\nN_large = 1,000,000 × 0.314 = 314,000\n\navg_small_kb(8) = 2 + 0.05 × 8 = 2.4 KB\navg_large_kb(8) = 512 + 0.50 × 8 = 516 KB\n\n#### Fragmentation overhead:\nTotal wasted space = (686,000 × (4 - 2)) + (314,000 × 4/2)\n                  = 686,000 × 2 + 314,000 × 2\n                  = 1,372,000 + 628,000\n                  = 2,000,000 KB\n\nFragmentation overhead = 2,000,000 / 1,000,000,000 = 0.002 = 0.2%\n\n#### Metadata overhead:\nTotal clusters for small files ≈ 686,000 (assuming 1 cluster per small file)\nTotal clusters for large files ≈ 314,000 × (516/4) ≈ 40,578,000\n\nTotal metadata size = 0.004 KB × (686,000 + 40,578,000) ≈ 165,056 KB\nMetadata overhead = 165,056 / 1,000,000,000 = 0.000165 = 0.0165%\n\nBoth overheads are below the required thresholds, but I should test if we can optimize further.\n\n### Step 5: Optimize with C = 8 KB\nWith C = 8 KB and T = 8 KB:\n\nP_small(8) = 0.686 (same as before)\nN_small = 686,000, N_large = 314,000\n\n#### Fragmentation overhead:\nTotal wasted space = (686,000 × (8 - 2)) + (314,000 × 8/2)\n                  = 686,000 × 6 + 314,000 × 4\n                  = 4,116,000 + 1,256,000\n                  = 5,372,000 KB\n\nFragmentation overhead = 5,372,000 / 1,000,000,000 = 0.00537 = 0.537%\nThis exceeds our limit of 0.5%.\n\n### Step 6: Final solution\nC = 4 KB and T = 8 KB satisfies all constraints:\n- Fragmentation overhead = 0.2% < 0.5%\n- Metadata overhead = 0.0165% < 0.05%\n\nTo be more precise with the calculations:\n\nFragmentation overhead = [(686,000 × (4 - 2)) + (314,000 × 4/2)] / 1,000,000,000\n                      = [686,000 × 2 + 314,000 × 2] / 1,000,000,000\n                      = 2,000,000 / 1,000,000,000\n                      = 0.002 = 0.2%\n\nMetadata overhead = 0.004 × (686,000 + 314,000 × (516/4)) / 1,000,000,000\n                 = 0.004 × (686,000 + 40,578,000) / 1,000,000,000\n                 = 0.004 × 41,264,000 / 1,000,000,000\n                 = 165,056 / 1,000,000,000\n                 = 0.000165056 = 0.0165056%\n\nTherefore, the optimal configuration is:\n- Cluster size (C) = 4 KB\n- Small-file threshold (T) = 8 KB\n- Fragmentation overhead = 0.2%\n- Metadata overhead = 0.0165%", config=ConfigFile(cluster_kb=4, small_threshold_kb=8, frag_overhead=0.2, meta_overhead=0.0165)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'cluster_power_of_2': True, 'cluster_in_range': True, 'threshold_power_of_2': True, 'frag_calc_correct': False, 'frag_meets_requirement': True, 'meta_calc_correct': False, 'meta_meets_requirement': True}, 'score': 60}
