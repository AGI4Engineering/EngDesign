Let me approach this step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Variables\n- Partition size = 1 TB = 1,000,000,000 KB\n- Total number of files = 1,000,000\n- T = small-file threshold in KB\n- P_small(T) = 0.8 × (1 − exp(− T / 4.1)) = fraction of files whose size ≤ T KB\n- avg_small_kb(T) = 2 + 0.05 × T (in KB)\n- avg_large_kb(T) = 512 + 0.50 × T (in KB)\n\n### Calculate Fragmentation Overhead\nFor a given cluster size (C) and threshold (T):\n\n1. Number of small files = P_small(T) × 1,000,000\n2. Number of large files = (1 - P_small(T)) × 1,000,000\n\n3. Average wasted space for small files (W_small) = C - avg_small_kb(T)\n4. Average wasted space for large files (W_large) = C / 2\n\n5. Total fragmentation = (Number of small files × W_small) + (Number of large files × W_large)\n\n6. Fragmentation overhead = Total fragmentation / Partition size\n\n### Calculate Metadata Overhead\nEach cluster requires 4 bytes of mapping information:\n\n1. Number of clusters for small files = Number of small files × ⌈avg_small_kb(T) / C⌉\n2. Number of clusters for large files = Number of large files × ⌈avg_large_kb(T) / C⌉\n\n3. Total metadata size = (Number of clusters for small files + Number of clusters for large files) × 4 bytes\n\n4. Metadata overhead = Total metadata size / Partition size\n\n### Finding the Optimal Cluster Size\nLet's try some values for cluster size (C) and threshold (T) to find the optimal combination that meets our requirements:\n\nLet's start with T = 32 KB and C = 32 KB:\n\nP_small(32) = 0.8 × (1 − exp(− 32 / 4.1)) ≈ 0.8 × (1 - exp(-7.805)) ≈ 0.8 × (1 - 0.0004) ≈ 0.8 × 0.9996 ≈ 0.7997\n\nNumber of small files = 0.7997 × 1,000,000 ≈ 799,700\nNumber of large files = 0.2003 × 1,000,000 ≈ 200,300\n\navg_small_kb(32) = 2 + 0.05 × 32 = 2 + 1.6 = 3.6 KB\navg_large_kb(32) = 512 + 0.50 × 32 = 512 + 16 = 528 KB\n\nW_small = 32 - 3.6 = 28.4 KB\nW_large = 32 / 2 = 16 KB\n\nTotal fragmentation = (799,700 × 28.4 KB) + (200,300 × 16 KB) ≈ 22,711,480 KB + 3,204,800 KB ≈ 25,916,280 KB\n\nFragmentation overhead = 25,916,280 KB / 1,000,000,000 KB ≈ 0.0259 = 2.59%\n\nThis is above our requirement of ≤ 0.5%, so we need to adjust.\n\nLet's try C = 8 KB and T = 8 KB:\n\nP_small(8) = 0.8 × (1 − exp(− 8 / 4.1)) ≈ 0.8 × (1 - exp(-1.951)) ≈ 0.8 × (1 - 0.1421) ≈ 0.8 × 0.8579 ≈ 0.6863\n\nNumber of small files = 0.6863 × 1,000,000 ≈ 686,300\nNumber of large files = 0.3137 × 1,000,000 ≈ 313,700\n\navg_small_kb(8) = 2 + 0.05 × 8 = 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 KB\navg_large_kb(8) = 512 + 0.50 × 8 = 512 + 4 = 516 KB\n\nW_small = 8 - 2.4 = 5.6 KB\nW_large = 8 / 2 = 4 KB\n\nTotal fragmentation = (686,300 × 5.6 KB) + (313,700 × 4 KB) ≈ 3,843,280 KB + 1,254,800 KB ≈ 5,098,080 KB\n\nFragmentation overhead = 5,098,080 KB / 1,000,000,000 KB ≈ 0.0051 = 0.51%\n\nThis is still slightly above our requirement. Let's continue adjusting.\n\nLet's try C = 4 KB and T = 4 KB:\n\nP_small(4) = 0.8 × (1 − exp(− 4 / 4.1)) ≈ 0.8 × (1 - exp(-0.976)) ≈ 0.8 × (1 - 0.3771) ≈ 0.8 × 0.6229 ≈ 0.4983\n\nNumber of small files = 0.4983 × 1,000,000 ≈ 498,300\nNumber of large files = 0.5017 × 1,000,000 ≈ 501,700\n\navg_small_kb(4) = 2 + 0.05 × 4 = 2 + 0.2 = 2.2 KB\navg_large_kb(4) = 512 + 0.50 × 4 = 512 + 2 = 514 KB\n\nW_small = 4 - 2.2 = 1.8 KB\nW_large = 4 / 2 = 2 KB\n\nTotal fragmentation = (498,300 × 1.8 KB) + (501,700 × 2 KB) ≈ 896,940 KB + 1,003,400 KB ≈ 1,900,340 KB\n\nFragmentation overhead = 1,900,340 KB / 1,000,000,000 KB ≈ 0.00190 = 0.190%\n\nThis is well within our requirement of ≤ 0.5%.\n\nNow let's calculate the metadata overhead:\n\nFor small files, each file needs ceil(2.2/4) = 1 cluster\nFor large files, each file needs ceil(514/4) = 129 clusters\n\nTotal clusters = 498,300 × 1 + 501,700 × 129 ≈ 498,300 + 64,719,300 ≈ 65,217,600\n\nMetadata size = 65,217,600 × 4 bytes = 260,870,400 bytes = 254,756 KB\n\nMetadata overhead = 254,756 KB / 1,000,000,000 KB ≈ 0.000255 = 0.0255%\n\nThis is also within our requirement of ≤ 0.05%.\n\nTherefore, a cluster size of 4 KB with a small-file threshold of 4 KB meets both our requirements:\n- Fragmentation overhead: 0.190% (≤ 0.5%)\n- Metadata overhead: 0.0255% (≤ 0.05%)", config=ConfigFile(cluster_kb=4, small_threshold_kb=4, frag_overhead=0.19, meta_overhead=0.0255)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'cluster_power_of_2': True, 'cluster_in_range': True, 'threshold_power_of_2': True, 'frag_calc_correct': False, 'frag_meets_requirement': True, 'meta_calc_correct': False, 'meta_meets_requirement': True}, 'score': 60}
