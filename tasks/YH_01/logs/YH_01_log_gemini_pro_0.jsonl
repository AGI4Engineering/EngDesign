Its computational intensity often makes it a bottleneck in high-performance applications. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer a promising platform for accelerating GEMM due to their inherent parallelism, reconfigurability, and potential for energy-efficient computation. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools like Vivado HLS allow designers to specify complex algorithms like GEMM in C/C++ and synthesize them into hardware, significantly reducing development time compared to traditional RTL design. This project focuses on developing an optimized HLS implementation of GEMM tailored for the Xilinx VCK5000 FPGA, emphasizing data movement optimization through tiling and maximizing resource utilization.', objectives=['Implement a Vivado HLS-compatible C++ function for single-precision floating-point matrix multiplication (C = A * B).', 'Support matrix dimensions M=256, N=256, K=256.', 'Employ a tiling strategy with block sizes TM=64, TN=64, TK=64 to optimize data reuse and minimize off-chip memory bandwidth.', 'Utilize specified array partitioning schemes for on-chip local buffers (localA, localB, localC) to enable high parallelism.', 'Apply HLS pragmas (PIPELINE, DATAFLOW, INTERFACE) to achieve high throughput and efficient hardware implementation on a VCK5000 board.', 'Optimize the design to maximize the utilization of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) slices on the VCK5000 board within the given constraints.'], significance='Successfully designing an efficient FPGA-based GEMM accelerator has significant real-world impact.

The matrices A, B, and C are composed of single-precision floating-point numbers. Matrix A has dimensions MxC, matrix B has dimensions KxN, and matrix C has dimensions MxN. For this specific implementation, M, N, and K are all 256. A tiling technique must be implemented with tile dimensions TM=64, TN=64, and TK=64. On-chip buffers `localA[TM][TK]`, `localB[TK][TN]`, and `localC[TM][TN]` are to be used for storing tiles. Specific HLS partitioning pragmas are required: `localA` partitioned completely across dimension 2, `localB` completely across dimension 1, and `localC` fully partitioned across all dimensions. The innermost loops responsible for computation should be pipelined with an Initiation Interval (II) of 1. Manual unrolling is disallowed, relying on HLS to infer unrolling from pipelining and partitioning.

Defining global constants for matrix and tile dimensions (M_SIZE, N_SIZE, K_SIZE, TM, TN, TK).\\n2. Implementing the `gemm` function with the specified signature and interface pragmas (`m_axi` for data arrays A, B, C, and `s_axilite` for control signals and base addresses).\\n3. Applying the `#pragma HLS DATAFLOW` to enable task-level parallelism between loading data, computation, and storing results.\\n4. Structuring the computation using three nested loops to iterate over tiles of the matrices A, B, and C.\\n5. Declaring local on-chip buffers (`localA`, `localB`, `localC`) for tile storage. `localC` is an accumulator buffer.\\n6. Applying `#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION` to these local buffers as specified: `localA` complete on dimension 2, `localB` complete on dimension 1, and `localC` complete on all dimensions. This enables parallel access to buffer elements.\\n7. Implementing tile computation: For each tile of C, iterate through corresponding tiles of A and B. The core computation `localC[tm][tn] += localA[tm][tk] * localB[tk][tn]` is performed by a nest of three loops (over `tm`, `tn`, `tk` within a tile).\\n8. Applying `#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1` to the loops iterating over `tm` and `tn` for the tile computation. Given the array partitioning, HLS is expected to unroll the innermost `tk` loop to achieve this II=1. This means for each cycle, one element (or part of one element if `tk` loop is not fully unrolled in one cycle) of `localC` is updated. The partitioning of `localA` (dim 2) and `localB` (dim 1) supports parallel access to elements required for unrolling the `tk` loop (dot product calculation).\\n9. The number of DSPs used will be TK (64) if one (tm,tn) pair is processed at a time. To maximize DSPs, HLS might parallelize processing of multiple `tm` rows. With `localA` partitioned on dim 2 (row-wise access) and `localB` on dim 1 (column-wise access), and `localC` fully partitioned, we can parallelize `F_TM` dot-product units. `F_TM` would be `floor(max_DSP_board / TK) = floor(1968/64) = 30`. This configuration would use `F_TM * TK = 30 * 64 = 1920` DSPs.'), results=Results(parameters='Key design parameters and expected outcomes:\\n- Matrix Dimensions (M, N, K): 256x256x256\\n- Tile Dimensions (TM, TN, TK): 64x64x64\\n- Target FPGA: Xilinx VCK5000\\n- Expected DSP Utilization: 1920 (based on 30 parallel dot-product units, each using 64 DSPs for an unrolled TK loop)\\n- Expected FF Utilization: ~500,000 (primarily for partitioned local buffers and pipeline registers)\\n- Expected LUT Utilization: ~100,000 (for control logic, multiplexers, and other combinational logic)\\n- Target Initiation Interval (II) for pipelined tile computation loops (tm, tn): 1\\n- Data Type: Single-precision float'), discussion_conclusion=Discussion_Conclusion(discussion=\"The design aims to maximize DSP utilization under the given constraints. The specified partitioning (`localA` complete on dim 2, `localB` complete on dim 1) naturally supports a dot-product computation structure where the `tk` loop is unrolled, using `TK` (64) multipliers per dot-product unit. To maximize DSPs on the VCK5000 (1968 DSPs), the HLS tool is expected to instantiate multiple such dot-product units in parallel, limited by `floor(max_DSP / TK) = floor(1968/64) = 30` units. This results in an estimated 1920 DSPs. This interpretation reconciles the 'maximize DSPs' goal with the specific partitioning instructions. If a different partitioning strategy (e.g., `localA` on dim 1, `localB` on dim 2) were allowed, an outer-product based computation (pipelining `tk` loop, unrolling `tm` and `tn` loops) could theoretically target `TM*TN = 4096` DSPs, which would then be capped by the board's 1968 DSPs. However, the current approach adheres strictly to the given partitioning. The `DATAFLOW` pragma will further help in overlapping memory operations with computation across different tiles, improving overall throughput.\", conclusion='This report outlines the design of an HLS-based matrix multiplication accelerator for the VCK5000 FPGA. The implementation adheres to specified matrix and tile dimensions, data types, and HLS pragmas for partitioning, pipelining, and interfaces. The design is structured to enable high parallelism by unrolling the innermost reduction loop (`tk`) and pipelining the tile dimension loops (`tm`, `tn`). This approach, combined with the specified array partitioning, is expected to utilize approximately 1920 DSP resources on the VCK5000, effectively leveraging its computational capabilities. The use of `HLS DATAFLOW` aims to ensure efficient concurrent execution of data loading, computation, and result storing stages. The resulting hardware should provide significant acceleration for GEMM operations compared to software execution, demonstrating the efficacy of HLS for complex algorithm implementation on FPGAs.')) config=ConfigFile(ops_num=16777216.0, parameters=Parameters(board_name=5000.0, max_DSP=1968.0, max_FF=2362000.0, max_LUT=1181000.0, optimal_DSP=1920.0, optimal_FF=500000.0, optimal_LUT=100000.0, m_size=256.0, n_size=256.0, k_size=256.0), hls_design='#include \"hls_stream.h\"\\n#include \"ap_int.h\"\\n#include \"ap_axi_sdata.h\"\\n\\n// Matrix dimensions and tile sizes\\n#define M_SIZE 256\\n#define K_SIZE 256\\n#define N_SIZE 256\\n#define TM 64\\n#define TN 64\\n#define TK 64\\n\\n// Helper functions for DATAFLOW (can be further modularized)\\nvoid load_A_tile(float A[M_SIZE][K_SIZE], float localA[TM][TK], int tile_row, int tile_k) {\\nLOAD_A_ROW: for (int i = 0; i < TM; ++i) {\\nLOAD_A_COL: for (int j = 0; j < TK; ++j) {\\n            #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\\n            localA[i][j] = A[tile_row * TM + i][tile_k * TK + j];\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nvoid load_B_tile(float B[K_SIZE][N_SIZE], float localB[TK][TN], int tile_k, int tile_col) {\\nLOAD_B_ROW: for (int i = 0; i < TK; ++i) {\\nLOAD_B_COL: for (int j = 0; j < TN; ++j) {\\n            #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\\n            localB[i][j] = B[tile_k * TK + i][tile_col * TN + j];\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nvoid compute_tile(float localA[TM][TK], float localB[TK][TN], float localC[TM][TN], bool first_k_tile) {\\n    // localC is an accumulator passed by reference implicitly (as it\\'s an array)\\nCOMPUTE_ROW: for (int i = 0; i < TM; ++i) {\\nCOMPUTE_COL: for (int j = 0; j < TN; ++j) {\\n            #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\\n            float sum = first_k_tile ?
