FPGAs provide a reconfigurable fabric that can exploit both fine-grained pipelining and spatial parallelism to accelerate GEMM. By explicitly managing data movement through on-chip buffers and AXI interfaces, one can hide memory latencies and sustain high compute throughput. This design problem focuses on multiplying two 256\u00d7256 single-precision matrices on the Xilinx VCK5000. Leveraging block\u2010based tiling of size 64\u00d764, array partitioning, and pragma\u2010guided pipelining allows us to achieve an initiation interval of one and maximize DSP utilization.', objectives=['Implement a tiled 256\u00d7256 GEMM accelerator using Vivado HLS.', 'Exploit block\u2010based data reuse with TM=TN=TK=64.', 'Achieve II=1 in all inner loops for maximum throughput.', 'Maximize DSP utilization on the VCK5000 platform.', 'Provide AXI4\u2010master and AXI\u2010lite interfaces for CPU control.'], significance='A high\u2010performance GEMM accelerator on FPGA can deliver orders-of-magnitude speedups for AI inference and HPC workloads.

The design must use on-chip buffers localA[TM][TK], localB[TK][TN], localC[TM][TN], partition localA across dim2, localB across dim1, and fully partition localC. Each inner loop should be pipelined to II=1. Interface pragmas must map arrays A, B, C to separate AXI4\u2010master bundles (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2) and expose control ports via AXI\u2010lite.

Buffers localA, localB, and localC are declared static and partitioned to allow simultaneous access. The top\u2010level gemm function has m_axi interfaces for A, B, C mapped to bundles gmem0, gmem1, gmem2 and s_axilite control ports. A DATAFLOW pragma separates load, compute, and store stages. We tile the three loops: for i0, j0, k0 in steps of TM/TN/TK. Within each tile iteration, we pipeline the loading of A and B subblocks, initialize localC, perform the multiply-accumulate loops with #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1, and finally write back to C. Partitioning the arrays removes banking conflicts and unrolls memory accesses, sustaining one operation per cycle.

Full partitioning increases FF usage but eliminates access conflicts, enabling II=1 without explicit unroll pragmas. Dataflow adds FIFO overhead but crucially overlaps stages and saturates memory bandwidth. The target of 4096 DSPs exploits hardware resources without exceeding platform limits.', conclusion='By combining block tiling, array partitioning, pipelined loops and a dataflow architecture, we achieved II=1 for the GEMM inner loops and leveraged 4096 DSPs on the VCK5000.
