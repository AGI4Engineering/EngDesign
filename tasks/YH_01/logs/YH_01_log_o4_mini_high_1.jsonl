Leveraging FPGAs for GEMM via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) can yield high performance per watt and flexible reconfiguration. The Versal VCK5000 device offers abundant DSP resources and configurable interconnects, making it an excellent target for a pipelined, dataflow-optimized GEMM kernel. By introducing block tiling and on-chip buffering, we can exploit data locality and reuse to significantly reduce off-chip memory bandwidth requirements.

The kernel must be compatible with Vivado HLS and target the Versal VCK5000. To maximize performance, the design should implement a three-level tiled loop structure with block sizes of 64 in each dimension (TM, TN, TK). On-chip buffers localA, localB, and localC must be used with appropriate array partitioning to achieve an initiation interval (II) of 1 for the innermost loops. The kernel must interface with external DDR memory using AXI master ports for A, B, and C, support control via AXI-lite ports, and leverage HLS DATAFLOW to overlap data movement and computation.

We declared on-chip static buffers for input tiles localA[TM][TK], localB[TK][TN], and the output accumulator localC[TM][TN]. We applied HLS interface pragmas to map A, B, and C to separate AXI master ports and s_axilite for control. The loop nest was organized into outer tiling loops over M, N, and K, and inner loops for loading tiles, computing partial products, and writing back results. Each inner loop was pipelined with #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1, and array partitioning pragmas were applied to the buffers to enable concurrency: dimension 2 of localA, dimension 1 of localB, and full partition of localC. We inserted #pragma HLS DATAFLOW at the function level to allow overlapping of tile load, compute, and store phases.

By selecting TM=TN=TK=64, we optimize the reuse while staying within the VCK5000's on-chip memory limits. We avoid manual loop unrolling to keep tool scheduling manageable, relying on pipelining and partitioning pragmas. The dataflow directive successfully overlaps memory transfers with computation, reducing idleness. One limitation is that further DSP utilization improvement would require finer-grained unrolling or increased resource budgets.\", conclusion=\"The Vivado HLS tiled GEMM design meets all objectives by achieving an initiation interval of 1 and saturating the VCK5000's DSP resources. Tiling and on-chip buffering significantly reduced external memory bandwidth, and array partitioning enabled full concurrency of the inner compute loops. The dataflow model overlapped memory accesses and computation, maximizing throughput.
