Data locality is enhanced by using on-chip BRAMs/registers for `localA`, `localB`, and `localC` tiles.', design_process='1. **Define Constants and Types**: Set global and tile dimensions (M_SIZE, N_SIZE, K_SIZE, TM, TN, TK).\\n2. **Top Function and Interfaces**: Define the `gemm` function signature. Apply `#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi` to global arrays A, B, C, mapping them to distinct memory bundles (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2) for parallel access. Apply `#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite` to array pointers and the function return for CPU control.\\n3. **Dataflow Optimization**: Apply `#pragma HLS DATAFLOW` at the top level of the `gemm` function to enable pipelining of the main processing stages (tile loading, computation, tile storing) across iterations of the outermost loops operating on tiles.\\n4. **Tiling Loops**: Implement three nested loops iterating over tiles (m0, n0, k0).\\n5. **Local Buffers and Partitioning**: Declare `localA[TM][TK]`, `localB[TK][TN]`, and `localC[TM][TN]`. Apply `#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localA complete dim=2` to allow parallel access to elements along the TK dimension. Apply `#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localB complete dim=1` to allow parallel access to elements along its TK dimension. Apply `#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localC complete dim=0` to make all elements of `localC` independently accessible, likely mapping them to registers.\\n6. **Tile Processing within k0 loop**: \\n   a. **Load A-tile**: Loop to load `A[m0:m0+TM-1][k0:k0+TK-1]` into `localA`. Inner loop pipelined (II=1).\\n   b. **Load B-tile**: Loop to load `B[k0:k0+TK-1][n0:n0+TN-1]` into `localB`. Inner loop pipelined (II=1).\\n   c. **Compute C-tile**: `localC[tm][tn] += localA[tm][tk] * localB[tk][tn]`. This involves three nested loops (tm, tn, tk for tile elements). The `tm` and `tn` loops iterate `TM` and `TN` times respectively. The innermost `tk` loop performs the dot product accumulation. To achieve II=1 for the computation of each `localC[tm][tn]` element, the `tn` (or `tm`) loop iterating over output elements is pipelined with `#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1`. This implies that the `tk` accumulation loop within its body is fully unrolled. This unrolling utilizes `TK` multipliers and `TK` adders in parallel, thus consuming `TK` (64) DSP blocks (for floating-point operations). The array partitioning for `localA` (dim 2, TK) and `localB` (dim 1, TK) supports this parallel access needed for unrolling the `tk` loop.\\n7. **Initialization and Store C-tile**: `localC` is initialized to zero before the `k0` loop for each `(m0, n0)` tile. After the `k0` loop completes, the final `localC` tile is written back to global memory. Both initialization and store operations have inner loops pipelined (II=1).\\n8. **DSP Maximization**: Given the fixed tile size `TK=64` and the partitioning scheme allowing the `tk` accumulation loop to be unrolled, the design naturally uses `TK=64` DSPs for the core MAC operations. This is the maximum achievable for a single processing element of this type under the specified constraints (no manual unroll of `tm` or `tn` loops for computation). Further DSP usage would require parallel processing elements or different tiling/unrolling strategies not permitted by the prompt details.'), results=Results(parameters='Key design parameters and expected outcomes:\\n- Matrix dimensions (M,N,K): 256x256x256\\n- Tile dimensions (TM,TN,TK): 64x64x64\\n- Target DSP usage: 64 DSPs (based on unrolling the TK-dimension dot-product accumulation, limited by tile size TK).\\n- Initiation Interval (II) for inner compute loops (processing one output element row/column): 1.\\n- Initiation Interval (II) for data loading/storing loops: 1.\\n- Dataflow optimization enabled for overlapping load/compute/store operations of tiles.\\n- Estimated FF usage: ~200,000 - 400,000 (primarily due to fully partitioned `localC` and partially partitioned `localA`, `localB` buffers potentially becoming registers, plus pipeline registers and control logic).\\n- Estimated LUT usage: ~150,000 - 300,000 (for arithmetic operations not mapped to DSPs, memory addressing, control logic, and routing).'), discussion_conclusion=Discussion_Conclusion(discussion=\"The design choices adhere to the specified constraints. The primary compromise relates to 'maximizing DSP usage'. While the VCK5000 has 1968 DSPs, the current design with TM=TN=TK=64 and the specified pipelining/partitioning strategy results in utilizing TK=64 DSPs for the core computation unit. This is because the `PIPELINE II=1` on the loop computing `localC` elements implies unrolling the innermost `TK` dimension accumulation. To use significantly more DSPs, one would typically either increase `TK` (if possible), or unroll the loops over `TM` or `TN` in the compute stage to process multiple `localC` elements in parallel, each using `TK` DSPs. However, the prompt forbids manual unrolling. The 'implied unrolling' by pipelining, given the array partitions, naturally leads to `TK` parallelism for the dot product. Increasing DSPs beyond this would require a different architectural approach, such as explicit parallel processing elements over tiles, which is outside the scope of the detailed HLS pragmas requested for a single tile computation unit. The current partitioning of `localA` (dim 2) and `localB` (dim 1) is optimal for the `TK`-unrolled dot product. Full partitioning of `localC` ensures no memory bottlenecks for updates. The `DATAFLOW` pragma is crucial for system-level throughput by overlapping tile operations.\", conclusion='This report outlines the HLS design for a tiled matrix multiplication function `gemm` targeting the VCK5000 FPGA. The design uses specified dimensions (M=N=K=256, TM=TN=TK=64) and HLS pragmas for interfaces, array partitioning, pipelining, and dataflow. The core computation is expected to achieve an II=1 for processing elements of the output tile, utilizing TK=64 DSPs by unrolling the accumulation loop. This design provides a high-throughput kernel for GEMM operations. While DSP utilization is limited by tile dimensions and pragma constraints, it represents an efficient use of resources for the defined processing element structure. The resulting hardware is expected to offer significant acceleration compared to software execution on a general-purpose processor for this specific matrix size and configuration.')) config=ConfigFile(ops_num=33554432.0, parameters=Parameters(board_name=5000.0, max_DSP=1968.0, max_FF=700000.0, max_LUT=401000.0, optimal_DSP=64.0, optimal_FF=300000.0, optimal_LUT=200000.0, m_size=256.0, n_size=256.0, k_size=256.0), hls_design='#include \"hls_stream.h\"\\n#include \"ap_int.h\"\\n#include \"ap_axi_sdata.h\"\\n\\n// Define matrix and tile sizes\\n#define M_SIZE 256\\n#define N_SIZE 256\\n#define K_SIZE 256\\n#define TM 64\\n#define TN 64\\n#define TK 64\\n\\n// Ensure TM, TN, TK are divisors of M_SIZE, N_SIZE, K_SIZE respectively for simplicity\\n// Or add boundary checks for partial tiles if not guaranteed.\\n\\nextern \"C\" {\\nvoid gemm(\\n    const float A[M_SIZE][K_SIZE],\\n    const float B[K_SIZE][N_SIZE],\\n    float C[M_SIZE][N_SIZE]\\n) {\\n    // Interface pragmas for global memory access and control\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=A offset=slave bundle=gmem0 depth=65536 // M_SIZE*K_SIZE\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=B offset=slave bundle=gmem1 depth=65536 // K_SIZE*N_SIZE\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=C offset=slave bundle=gmem2 depth=65536 // M_SIZE*N_SIZE\\n\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=A bundle=control\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=B bundle=control\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=C bundle=control\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=return bundle=control\\n\\n    // Dataflow pragma to enable task-level pipelining\\n    #pragma HLS DATAFLOW\\n\\n    // Local buffers for tiles\\n    float localA[TM][TK];\\n    #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localA complete dim=2\\n\\n    float localB[TK][TN];\\n    #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localB complete dim=1\\n\\n    float localC[TM][TN];\\n    #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localC complete dim=0 // Fully partition for register access\\n\\n    // Tile loops\\n    m0_loop: for (int m0 = 0; m0 < M_SIZE; m0 += TM) {\\n        n0_loop: for (int n0 = 0; n0 < N_SIZE; n0 += TN) {\\n            // Initialize localC tile\\n            init_localC_dim1: for (int i = 0; i < TM; i++) {\\n                init_localC_dim2: for (int j = 0; j < TN; j++) {\\n                    #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\\n                    localC[i][j] = 0.0f;\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Accumulate products over k0 tiles\\n            k0_loop: for (int k0 = 0; k0 < K_SIZE; k0 += TK) {\\n                // These load and compute sections will be pipelined by DATAFLOW\\n                // Load tile of A from global memory to localA\\n                load_A_dim1: for (int la_i = 0; la_i < TM; ++la_i) {\\n                    load_A_dim2: for (int la_j = 0; la_j < TK; ++la_j) {\\n                        #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\\n                        localA[la_i][la_j] = A[m0 + la_i][k0 + la_j];\\n                    }\\n                }\\n\\n                // Load tile of B from global memory to localB\\n                load_B_dim1: for (int lb_i = 0; lb_i < TK; ++lb_i) {\\n                    load_B_dim2: for (int lb_j = 0; lb_j < TN; ++lb_j) {\\n                        #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\\n                        localB[lb_i][lb_j] = B[k0 + lb_i][n0 + lb_j];\\n                    }\\n                }\\n\\n                // Compute: localC tile += localA tile * localB tile\\n                compute_tile_dim_tm: for (int tm_comp = 0; tm_comp < TM; ++tm_comp) {\\n                    compute_tile_dim_tn: for (int tn_comp = 0; tn_comp < TN; ++tn_comp) {\\n                        #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1 // This pipeline implies the tk_comp loop is unrolled\\n                        float sum_val = localC[tm_comp][tn_comp];\\n                        accum_k: for (int tk_comp = 0; tk_comp < TK; ++tk_comp) {\\n                            // #pragma HLS UNROLL // Implied due to PIPELINE II=1 on parent loop and array partitioning\\n                            sum_val += localA[tm_comp][tk_comp] * localB[tk_comp][tn_comp];\\n                        }\\n                        localC[tm_comp][tn_comp] = sum_val;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            } // end k0_loop\\n\\n            // Store computed localC tile to global memory C\\n            store_C_dim1: for (int sc_i = 0; sc_i < TM; ++sc_i) {\\n                store_C_dim2: for (int sc_j = 0; sc_j < TN; ++sc_j) {\\n                    #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\\n                    C[m0 + sc_i][n0 + sc_j] = localC[sc_i][sc_j];\\n                }\\n            }\\n        } // end n0_loop\\n    } // end m0_loop\\n}\\n\\n}\\n')", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": "Simulation failed", "score": 0}
