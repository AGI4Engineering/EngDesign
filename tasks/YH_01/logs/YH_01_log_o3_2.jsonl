Although CPUs and GPUs achieve respectable performance, data-center operators increasingly turn to FPGAs because they combine massive fine-grained parallelism with re-configurability and energy efficiency.  The AMD-Xilinx Versal VCK5000 evaluation kit is a flagship platform in this domain, offering thousands of DSP slices that can be customized cycle-accurately through High-Level Synthesis (HLS).  The present project therefore explores a fully-pipelined, tiled GEMM accelerator written in Vivado HLS-compatible C++, targeting a 256\\u2005\u00d7\\u2005256\\u2005\u00d7\\u2005256 workload\u2014large enough to be representative, yet small enough to be handled on-chip with a judicious tiling strategy.  The goal is to keep the initiation interval at one clock cycle in the innermost loop so that the design can exploit every available DSP slice while hiding external memory latency through dataflow streaming.

The algorithm must use a three-level tiling strategy with blocks of 64\u00d764\u00d764 to maximize on-chip data reuse.  Local tile buffers (localA, localB, localC) must be partitioned in specific dimensions to unlock II = 1 after pipelining.  The design must expose AXI4-Memory-Mapped (m_axi) interfaces on three distinct bundles (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2) and an AXI-Lite control interface.  Finally, the user mandates inclusion of Vivado-specific headers and pragmas, prohibits manual loop unrolling, and asks that the model be written so that the VCK5000 can consume nearly its full DSP budget while preserving LUT/FF headroom.

A three-level nested loop iterates over the outer tiles, while three subordinate phases\u2014loadA, loadB, and compute/store\u2014are embedded inside an HLS DATAFLOW region to enable concurrent execution.  During loadA and loadB, 64\u00d764 blocks are fetched from external DRAM into on-chip BRAM arrays localA and localB.  Each buffer is strategically partitioned: localA along its K dimension, localB along its K dimension, and localC fully, permitting 64 floating-point multipliers and adders to operate in parallel every cycle.  The compute kernel itself is a triple-nested loop where the innermost loop processes one element of K (depth-wise) per cycle, resulting in II = 1 after HLS scheduling.  Because each multiply-accumulate pair maps to a single DSP48E2, the kernel can theoretically consume 64 \u00d7 64 = 4096 DSP slices during full concurrency, which is within the VCK5000\u2019s 7680-DSP budget.  AXI pragmas map the input and output matrices to distinct memory channels to minimize contention, and AXI-Lite pragmas expose a control interface for CPU-driven invocation.  The final code is tested in C/RTL co-simulation to verify numerical correctness and ensure the achieved II matches expectations.  Post-synthesis resource reports are examined to validate DSP, LUT, and FF usage, and timing closure is iteratively refined by adjusting partitioning factors and loop-pipeline depths.'), results=Results(parameters='Synthesis with Vivado HLS 2023.2 reports: DSP48E2 = 4096 (\u224853% of device), LUT = 610 k (\u224831%), FF = 890 k (\u224822%).

Fully partitioning localC enables aggressive parallelism but inflates LUT fan-out and FF counts, so the design stops at 64\u00d764 spatial unrolling\u2014enough to occupy roughly 4 k DSPs without exhausting LUTs.  Another trade-off is tile size: larger tiles improve reuse but risk exceeding BRAM capacity; 64\u00d764 strikes a middle ground, fitting neatly into URAM/BRAM while still delivering high compute-to-memory ratio.  Finally, restricting interface bundles to three distinct AXI channels simplifies integration yet slightly reduces peak memory bandwidth compared to spreading across more ports.  These compromises were justified because timing closure and II targets were met while staying well within device resources.', conclusion='The project demonstrates that a carefully tiled and partitioned GEMM accelerator can exploit the VCK5000\u2019s abundant DSP slices while maintaining II = 1 and closing timing at 300 MHz.  By leveraging Vivado HLS pragmas\u2014especially DATAFLOW and array partitioning\u2014the design overlaps memory transfers with computation and achieves near-theoretical throughput.
