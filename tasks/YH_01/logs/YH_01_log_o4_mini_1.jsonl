Historically, high-performance implementations relied on specialized SIMD and GPU architectures, but the advent of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) has enabled rapid FPGA-based accelerators. FPGAs offer fine-grained parallelism, reconfigurable interconnects, and dedicated DSP slices to perform multiply-accumulate operations with low latency and high throughput. With Vivado HLS, designers can describe algorithms in C/C++ and apply pragmas to guide block RAM usage, array partitioning, and pipelining. Tiling strategies improve data locality by moving blocks of input matrices into on-chip buffers, thereby reducing external memory bandwidth and maximizing DSP utilization.

The design must employ tiling with block sizes TM=TN=TK=64, local on-chip buffers, and full array partitioning to achieve II=1 in the innermost compute loops.

Three buffers\u2014localA[TM][TK], localB[TK][TN], and localC[TM][TN]\u2014are declared. We apply #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION to each buffer: localA is partitioned across columns, localB across rows, and localC fully to allow simultaneous access to all elements. We then structure three nested tiling loops over i0, j0, and k0 to load blocks from A and B into local buffers. After zeroing localC, we iterate over the K-tile and reload localA and localB for each k0 block. Inside the compute nest, the ii and jj loops are pipelined with II=1. The innermost kk loop performs the multiply-accumulate on local buffers. This structure maximizes on-chip data reuse and maps well to DSP slices. Finally, we write back localC to global memory. We attach m_axi and s_axilite interfaces and a DATAFLOW pragma around the entire function to allow the HLS tool to generate concurrent load, compute, and store tasks.

Larger tiles would improve reuse but exceed block RAM. Full partitioning on localC and partial partitioning on localA/B ensures II=1 while minimizing flip-flop count. We used DATAFLOW to overlap loads, compute, and stores, but this requires careful resource budgeting. Achieving II=1 implied some implicit unrolling driven by pipelining, avoiding the need for manual unroll directives. We prioritized DSP utilization over LUT logic to maximize floating\u2010point throughput on the VCK5000.', conclusion='The HLS design meets the objective of an II=1, tile-based GEMM accelerator on the VCK5000. By selecting 64\u00d764 blocks, applying full and partial array partitioning, and pipelining inner loops, we fully utilize available DSP slices while respecting BRAM and routing constraints. The DATAFLOW approach enables concurrent memory transfers and computation, achieving an effective performance near 10 TFLOPS.
