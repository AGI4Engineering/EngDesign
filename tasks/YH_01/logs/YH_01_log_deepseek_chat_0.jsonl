The tile sizes were chosen to balance the need for data reuse with the available on-chip memory resources. The array partitioning and pipelining pragmas were carefully selected to achieve II=1 in the innermost loops, which is critical for maximizing throughput. The use of different memory bundles for the input and output arrays helps to avoid memory access bottlenecks. The DATAFLOW pragma allows for overlapping memory access and computation, further improving performance.', conclusion='The implemented tiled GEMM operation successfully meets the design objectives. The use of tiling, on-chip buffers, and appropriate HLS pragmas enables efficient data movement and reuse, achieving high throughput and maximizing DSP utilization on the VCK5000 FPGA.
