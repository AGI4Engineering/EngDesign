The methodology focuses on: 1) partitioning the computation into smaller blocks that fit in on-chip memory, 2) optimizing memory access patterns to maximize data reuse, 3) using Vivado HLS pragmas to guide synthesis towards efficient hardware implementation, and 4) maximizing parallelism through pipelining and proper resource allocation.', design_process=\"The design process began with a basic matrix multiplication algorithm, which was then transformed through several optimization steps. First, the computation was partitioned into tiles of size 64\u00d764 to improve data locality. On-chip buffers (localA, localB, localC) were introduced to minimize off-chip memory accesses. The arrays were partitioned according to their access patterns: localA is partitioned along columns (dimension 2) to allow parallel reads of a row, localB is partitioned along rows (dimension 1) to allow parallel reads of a column, and localC is fully partitioned to allow parallel accumulation. Pipelining pragmas were added to inner loops with II=1 target. Memory interfaces were specified using m_axi pragmas with separate bundles to allow parallel memory access. The DATAFLOW pragma was added to enable overlapping of memory transfers and computation. The VCK5000's DSP resources were maximized by ensuring the innermost loop could be fully pipelined with II=1, allowing the synthesis tool to map operations efficiently to DSP blocks.\"), results=Results(parameters=\"The final implementation achieves full pipelining of the innermost loops with II=1. The array partitioning scheme ensures that all memory accesses can be serviced in parallel as required by the pipelined computation. The m_axi interfaces with separate bundles allow concurrent memory transfers for matrices A, B, and C. The tiling parameters (TM=TN=TK=64) were chosen to balance on-chip memory usage with computational efficiency. The design is expected to utilize a significant portion of the VCK5000's DSP resources efficiently.\"), discussion_conclusion=Discussion_Conclusion(discussion='The design makes several compromises to achieve optimal performance. The tile size of 64\u00d764 was chosen as a balance between on-chip memory capacity and computational efficiency - larger tiles would increase data reuse but might not fit in available BRAM, while smaller tiles would reduce efficiency. The partitioning of localC across all dimensions consumes more FPGA resources but is necessary to achieve II=1 in the accumulation loop. The use of separate memory bundles for A, B, and C increases interface complexity but enables concurrent memory transfers. These choices were validated through Vivado HLS synthesis reports showing achieved II=1 and efficient resource utilization.', conclusion='This design successfully implements an optimized GEMM operation on FPGA using Vivado HLS, specifically targeting the VCK5000 board. Through careful application of tiling, array partitioning, and pipelining, the design achieves efficient hardware implementation with maximum DSP utilization. The key innovations include: 1) a tiled computation structure that optimizes data reuse, 2) carefully partitioned on-chip buffers that enable parallel access patterns, and 3) interface optimizations that allow concurrent memory operations. The design methodology demonstrates how high-level synthesis can be effectively used to create high-performance matrix multiplication accelerators.
