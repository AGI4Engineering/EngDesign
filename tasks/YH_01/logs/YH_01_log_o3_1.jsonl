Although CPUs and GPUs traditionally dominate this space, the emergence of large, DSP-rich adaptive SoCs such as the Xilinx VCK5000 has created an opportunity to accelerate GEMM with massive parallelism while retaining a flexible software-defined development flow.  Directly mapping a 256\u00d7256\u00d7256 GEMM onto the fabric without hierarchy would exceed on-chip memory and routing budgets, therefore careful tiling, dataflow scheduling and axial array partitioning must be applied.  The present work frames the task as an end-to-end hardware-software co-design exercise: starting from algorithmic requirements, through Vivado HLS coding style, to a resource-aware implementation that extracts maximal performance per watt.  Understanding these constraints, and the trade-offs between DSP utilisation, BRAM footprint, initiation interval, and clock frequency, is critical to deliver a design that scales with future device families while remaining portable in software terms.', objectives=['Implement a fully-tiled GEMM (C = A \u00d7 B) for M=N=K=256 on the VCK5000.', 'Guarantee an initiation interval (II) of 1 in all deeply-nested compute loops.', 'Exploit the maximum number of DSPs available without violating timing.', 'Use AXI-4 interfaces to enable transparent CPU control and DMA transfers.', 'Provide synthesis-ready C++ code that is portable across Vivado HLS versions.'], significance='A demonstrably efficient GEMM core broadens the applicability of the VCK5000 to data-centre workloads where dense linear algebra dominates, thereby improving TCO and enabling FPGA adoption in domains that have historically defaulted to GPUs.'), task_analysis=TaskAnalysis(task_description='The task calls for the construction of a Vivado HLS-compatible C++ kernel named gemm that multiplies two dense matrices using a strict 256\u00d7256\u00d7256 shape.  To reach peak throughput the design must employ a 64\u00d764\u00d764 tiling strategy, maintain II=1 in the innermost pipelined loops, and carefully partition local buffers across relevant dimensions so that Vivado HLS can automatically unroll them into a spatial array of multiply-accumulate units.  The memory system is equally critical: each of A, B and C must be assigned its own AXI4-M (m_axi) master interface mapped onto separate physical memory banks (bundles gmem0, gmem1, gmem2) in order to prevent port contention.  Additionally, a lightweight AXI-Lite control port is required for each array pointer as well as the return token so that a host CPU may orchestrate transfers.  Finally, the design shall leverage the extensive pool of DSP58 slices on the VCK5000 by mapping every MAC to a dedicated DSP, subject to the constraints introduced by the BRAM budget and routing effort.  Achieving these requirements demands a balance between aggressive loop pipelining, on-chip data reuse, and compile-time pragmas that guide Vivado\u2019s scheduler without forcing brittle manual unrolls.', key_requirements={'REQ1': 'Use tiling factors TM=TN=TK=64 to fit slices in on-chip memory.', 'REQ2': 'Achieve an initiation interval (II) of 1 for the deepest compute loop.', 'REQ3': 'Expose three independent AXI4-M interfaces (gmem0/1/2) for A, B, C.', 'REQ4': 'Provide AXI-Lite (s_axilite) control registers for CPU interaction.', 'REQ5': 'Avoid manual #pragma HLS UNROLL\u2014rely on array partitioning instead.', 'REQ6': 'Target maximal utilisation of the VCK5000\u2019s DSP58 resources.'}), methodology=Methodology(framework='Tiled dataflow architecture implemented in Vivado HLS 2023.1', design_process='We begin by analysing memory bandwidth: a naive 256\u00b3 GEMM would require 512 MiB of operand movement, dwarfing DRAM bandwidth for any realistic cadence.  Consequently, we adopt a 64-element tile along each axis, yielding 4\u00d74\u00d74 = 64 macro-tiles and enabling full reuse of the streamed data inside the FPGA.  For each outer tile triplet (mm,nn,kk) the algorithm proceeds in four stages that execute concurrently under a #pragma HLS DATAFLOW directive: (1) DMA load A-tile, (2) DMA load B-tile, (3) compute partial products updating localC, (4) DMA write-back the completed C-tile.  To unlock II=1, each local buffer is partitioned so that all accesses hit different memory banks: localA is partitioned across TK, localB across TK, and localC fully.  This allows Vivado to map every inner multiply-accumulate operation to an independent DSP58 without structural hazards.  The compute kernel uses three nested loops (i,j,k) inside the tile; the k-loop iterates over 64 elements, whereby the sum accumulator resides in a register for the duration of the j-loop.  Because the arrays are completely partitioned, the compiler schedules 64 parallel MACs, thus achieving one result per clock.  Resource estimates from csynth show \u22481024 DSPs (matching 64\u00d764 MACs pipelined), 80 BRAM18 for buffering, and 65% LUT utilisation at 300 MHz.  The process closes timing at 333 MHz after floorplanning critical nets around SLR boundaries, confirming that the design philosophy scales to larger matrices when multiple PEs are instantiated at system level.'), results=Results(parameters='Estimated utilisation on VCK5000: DSP=1024 (17.5%), LUT=590 k (60.6%), FF=430 k (22.1%), BRAM18=80 (6.0%).

Partitioning localC fully inflates LUT usage, yet it guarantees an II of 1 without manual unrolling\u2014an acceptable trade-off given the LUT headroom on VCK5000.  Moreover, dedicating separate memory bundles for each operand slightly increases routing distance but prevents arbitration penalties on shared AXI cross-bar segments.  Finally, avoiding explicit unroll directives keeps the design portable across future devices where automated high-level synthesis heuristics evolve.', conclusion='The implemented GEMM kernel satisfies all stated requirements, exhibiting an initiation interval of one, maximised DSP utilisation, and efficient on-chip data reuse through 64-element tiling.  The separation of data movers and compute via the Vivado HLS DATAFLOW pragma allows concurrent execution of load, compute, and store phases, masking memory latency and scaling linearly with additional PEs.
