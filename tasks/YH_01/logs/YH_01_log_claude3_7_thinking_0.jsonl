By breaking the large matrix multiplication into smaller blocks, we can ensure that data fits in the FPGA's on-chip memory and can be reused multiple times. We use array partitioning strategically to enable parallel access to data elements, allowing the implementation to fully utilize the available DSP slices on the FPGA.", design_process='The GEMM implementation is structured in a hierarchical manner. First, we divide the matrices into tiles of size 64×64 and process them in a loop nest. For each tile, we load data from global memory into local buffers, perform the computation, and then write the results back to global memory.\n\nTo maximize DSP utilization, we partition the local buffers to enable parallel access: localA is partitioned across dimension 2 (the K dimension), localB is partitioned across dimension 1 (also the K dimension from a different perspective), and localC is fully partitioned across both dimensions. This partitioning scheme allows multiple multiply-accumulate operations to execute in parallel.\n\nThe innermost loop is pipelined with II=1, which means a new iteration can start every clock cycle, maximizing throughput. The loop ordering is carefully chosen to maximize data reuse: for each element of localA and localB loaded into on-chip memory, we perform multiple computations before discarding it.\n\nMemory interfaces are set up using m_axi pragmas for high-bandwidth global memory access, with different memory bundles (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2) for A, B, and C to avoid memory port conflicts. The s_axilite interface is used for control signals to communicate with the host CPU.\n\nThe optimization process involved several iterations. Initially, we considered using dataflow to overlap memory access and computation, but since the operations have sequential dependencies (load, compute, store), we focused instead on maximizing the parallelism within each stage through careful array partitioning and pipelining.'), results=Results(parameters='For our GEMM implementation with M=N=K=256 and tile sizes TM=TN=TK=64, we achieved the following:\n\n1. Fully partitioned localC[64][64] buffer enables up to 4096 parallel MAC operations.\n2. Partitioning localA completely in dimension 2 allows parallel access to all elements in the K dimension.\n3. Partitioning localB completely in dimension 1 allows parallel access to all elements in the K dimension from the other perspective.\n4. The innermost loop achieves II=1, meaning a new MAC operation can begin every clock cycle.\n5. The design efficiently utilizes DSP resources on the VCK5000 by enabling multiple parallel multiply-accumulate operations.\n\nThe tiling strategy reduces the required on-chip memory from storing full 256×256 matrices to just 64×64 tiles, making efficient use of BRAM resources while maintaining high computational throughput.'), discussion_conclusion=Discussion_Conclusion(discussion='During the design process, several trade-offs were considered. A key compromise was between tile size and parallelism. Larger tiles would improve data reuse but require more on-chip memory, while smaller tiles would reduce memory requirements but increase the number of off-chip memory accesses. The tile size of 64×64 was chosen as a balance between these concerns.\n\nAnother consideration was the placement of the HLS pragmas. Initially, we considered placing the PIPELINE pragma on outer loops to increase parallelism, but this would have required excessive resources. By focusing the pipelining on the innermost loops and using appropriate array partitioning, we could achieve high throughput without excessive resource usage.\n\nThe array partitioning strategy was carefully designed to match the computation pattern. By fully partitioning localC and partially partitioning localA and localB along complementary dimensions, we ensured that the design could access all data needed for parallel MAC operations without memory port conflicts.', conclusion='The implemented GEMM solution effectively balances performance and resource utilization on the VCK5000 FPGA. By using a tiling approach with carefully selected block sizes (64×64), we were able to maximize data reuse while fitting within on-chip memory constraints. The strategic array partitioning and loop pipelining enabled high DSP utilization, achieving an initiation interval of 1 for the innermost computation loops.\n\nThe implementation demonstrates how HLS can be used to create high-performance FPGA designs for compute-intensive operations like matrix multiplication. The approach taken—combining tiling, array partitioning, and loop pipelining—provides a template that can be adapted for other similar computational kernels.\n\nFuture improvements could explore more advanced techniques such as double buffering to further overlap computation and memory access, or mixed-precision computation to increase effective throughput. Additionally, the design could be extended to handle variable-sized matrices or specialized for particular applications like convolutional neural networks.\n\nOverall, this implementation shows that with proper optimization techniques, FPGAs can serve as efficient accelerators for matrix multiplication operations, offering high performance and energy efficiency compared to traditional CPU implementations.')), config=ConfigFile(ops_num=1.0, parameters=Parameters(board_name=5000.0, max_DSP=9024.0, max_FF=2607360.0, max_LUT=1303680.0, optimal_DSP=4096.0, optimal_FF=409600.0, optimal_LUT=204800.0, m_size=256.0, n_size=256.0, k_size=256.0), hls_design='#include "hls_stream.h"\n#include "ap_int.h"\n#include "ap_axi_sdata.h"\n\n#define M_SIZE 256\n#define K_SIZE 256\n#define N_SIZE 256\n\n#define TM 64\n#define TN 64\n#define TK 64\n\nvoid gemm(float A[M_SIZE][K_SIZE], float B[K_SIZE][N_SIZE], float C[M_SIZE][N_SIZE]) {\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=A offset=slave bundle=gmem0\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=B offset=slave bundle=gmem1\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=C offset=slave bundle=gmem2\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=A\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=B\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=C\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=return\n    \n    #pragma HLS DATAFLOW\n    \n    // Tiled matrix multiplication\n    for (int m_tile = 0; m_tile < M_SIZE; m_tile += TM) {\n        for (int n_tile = 0; n_tile < N_SIZE; n_tile += TN) {\n            float localC[TM][TN];\n            #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localC complete dim=0\n            \n            // Initialize localC to zeros\n            for (int i = 0; i < TM; i++) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < TN; j++) {\n                    #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\n                    localC[i][j] = 0.0f;\n                }\n            }\n            \n            // Compute over all K tiles\n            for (int k_tile = 0; k_tile < K_SIZE; k_tile += TK) {\n                float localA[TM][TK];\n                #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localA complete dim=2\n                \n                float localB[TK][TN];\n                #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localB complete dim=1\n                \n                // Load A tile\n                for (int i = 0; i < TM; i++) {\n                    for (int k = 0; k < TK; k++) {\n                        #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\n                        localA[i][k] = A[m_tile + i][k_tile + k];\n                    }\n                }\n                \n                // Load B tile\n                for (int k = 0; k < TK; k++) {\n                    for (int j = 0; j < TN; j++) {\n                        #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\n                        localB[k][j] = B[k_tile + k][n_tile + j];\n                    }\n                }\n                \n                // Compute matrix multiplication for this tile\n                for (int i = 0; i < TM; i++) {\n                    for (int j = 0; j < TN; j++) {\n                        // Use a local variable to accumulate\n                        float sum = localC[i][j];\n                        \n                        // Use a pipelined loop for the k dimension\n                        for (int k = 0; k < TK; k++) {\n                            #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\n                            sum += localA[i][k] * localB[k][j];\n                        }\n                        \n                        localC[i][j] = sum;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            \n            // Store results back to global memory\n            for (int i = 0; i < TM; i++) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < TN; j++) {\n                    #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\n                    C[m_tile + i][n_tile + j] = localC[i][j];\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': 'Synthesis failed', 'score': 0}
