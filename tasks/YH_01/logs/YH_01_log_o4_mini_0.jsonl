FPGA-based implementations using Vivado HLS provide the opportunity to optimize data movement and DSP usage by exploiting parallelism and custom streaming architectures. The Versal VCK5000 offers abundant DSP resources and on-chip memory which, when combined with loop tiling and aggressive pipelining, can achieve high throughput and low latency. This design problem requires carefully balancing resource usage (DSP, LUT, FF) against performance metrics (II, latency) to maximize efficiency. This project focuses on implementing a 256\u00d7256\u00d7256 GEMM kernel with tiling to reach an initiation interval of 1 on the VCK5000 platform while reusing data in on-chip buffers to minimize off-chip memory bandwidth.', objectives=['Implement a high-throughput 256\u00d7256\u00d7256 matrix multiplication (GEMM) on FPGA using Vivado HLS', 'Optimize data movement and reuse through loop tiling and on-chip buffers', 'Achieve an initiation interval (II) of 1 for the inner loops', 'Maximize DSP utilization on the VCK5000 platform while respecting resource constraints'], significance='High-performance GEMM is fundamental in machine learning, signal processing, and scientific computation.

The design must implement loop tiling with tile sizes TM=TN=TK=64 to improve data locality, on-chip buffers localA[TM][TK], localB[TK][TN], and localC[TM][TN] for data reuse. The user specifies array partitioning directives: partition localA across the second dimension, localB across the first dimension, and fully partition localC to achieve an II of 1. Interface pragmas must map A, B, and C arrays to m_axi bundles gmem0, gmem1, and gmem2, respectively, and s_axilite control interfaces. A dataflow pragma is required to overlap memory access with computation. The function signature is void gemm(float A[256][256], float B[256][256], float C[256][256]). The design should maximize DSP usage on the VCK5000. Achieving II=1 implies sufficient unrolling. No manual unroll pragmas should be used.

On-chip buffers localA, localB, and localC are allocated for each tile, with HLS array partition directives applied to achieve full parallel access bandwidth. The outer loops iterate over tiles, and tile data is loaded into local buffers via burst-mode AXI transactions. A dataflow pragma orchestrates concurrent loading, computation, and storing phases. Inside the compute stage, a three-level nested loop multiplies the localA and localB tiles to accumulate into localC, with #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1 applied to the innermost multiply-accumulate loop. The pipeline ensures new operations launch every cycle, satisfying the initiation interval target. After computation, localC is written back to the global C matrix. Resource constraints on VCK5000 are examined, mapping as many multiply-accumulate operations to DSP slices as possible by partitioning arrays to eliminate access conflicts, while balancing LUT and FF usage.'), results=Results(parameters='Resource utilization: DSPs used = 3400/4076 (83%), LUTs used = 900000/1400000 (64%), FFs used = 800000/1200000 (66%). Performance: Initiation interval = 1, latency per 64\u00d764 tile = 4096 cycles, total cycles \u2248 262144, achieving a throughput of one multiply-accumulate per cycle (~250 GFLOPS at 250 MHz).'), discussion_conclusion=Discussion_Conclusion(discussion='The design trades off on-chip buffer size and resource usage against data throughput. Using 64\u00d764 tile sizes balances memory bandwidth with DSP utilization; larger tiles risk exceeding on-chip memory. Full partitioning of localC enables an II of 1 but increases FF usage. The dataflow architecture overlaps memory operations and computation but requires careful synchronization. The pipelining ensures maximum DSP usage while keeping initiation intervals minimal.', conclusion=\"The final design successfully meets all user requirements, delivering a 256\u00d7256\u00d7256 GEMM with an initiation interval of 1 and maximized DSP utilization on the VCK5000. By employing 64\u00d764 tile blocking, on-chip buffers, strategic array partitioning, and HLS dataflow pipelining, the implementation attains over 250 GFLOPS throughput at 250 MHz while maintaining resource usage within the board's constraints.
