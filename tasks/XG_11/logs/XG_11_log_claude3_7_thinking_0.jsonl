The roll-off frequency ωr is high enough to not significantly affect performance at ωL = 1 rad/sec\n2. But low enough to attenuate gain at the problematic frequencies (12.5 and 13.4 rad/sec)\n3. The resulting closed-loop system meets the phase and gain margin requirements\n\nAfter analysis, I'll choose ωr = 7 rad/sec and βr = 1.2 to place the roll-off between the desired bandwidth and the problematic frequencies.\n\nWith these values:\nFr(s) = (1.2·7)²/(s² + √2·1.2·7·s + (1.2·7)²) = 70.56/(s² + 11.8794s + 70.56)\n\nCalculating |Fr(j·7)| = 70.56/√((21.56)² + (83.1558)²) = 70.56/85.8577 ≈ 0.8218\n\nTherefore Kr(s) = (70.56/(s² + 11.8794s + 70.56))·(1/0.8218) = 85.8577/(s² + 11.8794s + 70.56)\n\nThese values of βr and ωr will satisfy the requirements because:\n- ωr = 7 is far enough from ωL = 1 to maintain desired bandwidth\n- It's low enough to attenuate gain before the problematic frequencies of 12.5 and 13.4 rad/sec\n- The attenuation is sufficient to stabilize the closed-loop system\n- The resulting phase and gain margins will meet the requirements due to proper placement of the roll-off", config=ConfigFile(C_num=[6.2867, 1.988], C_den=[3.3166, 0.0], omega_r=7.0, beta_r=1.2)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'num_passed': True, 'den_passed': True, 'stability_passed': True, 'phase_margin_passed': True, 'gain_margin_passed': True, 'gain_margin': matlab.double([[0.0,5.838258978210983]]), 'phase_margin': matlab.double([[63.482691530323756,-66.54012674748894,-176.89051193470624]]), 'score': 100.0, 'passed': True}, 'score': 100.0}
