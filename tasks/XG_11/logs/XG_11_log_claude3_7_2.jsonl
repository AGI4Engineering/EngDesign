Let me recalculate:\n\nC(s) = Kg · Ki(s)\n     = 1.9880 · (3.1623·s + 1)/(3.3166·s)\n     = (1.9880 · 3.1623·s + 1.9880)/(3.3166·s)\n     = (6.2865·s + 1.9880)/(3.3166·s)\n\nNow in standard form:\nC(s) = (6.2865·s + 1.9880)/(3.3166·s)\n\nTherefore:\nC_num = [6.2865, 1.9880]\nC_den = [3.3166, 0]\n\nLet me now normalize so that the first coefficient of the denominator is 1:\nC(s) = (1.8955·s + 0.5994)/s\n\nTherefore, the final coefficients are:\nC_num = [1.8955, 0.5994]\nC_den = [1, 0]\n\n### Task 2: Designing a roll-off element to stabilize the closed-loop system\n\nI need to add a roll-off element Kᵣ(s) to stabilize the system. Let me design this element by selecting appropriate values for βᵣ and ωᵣ.\n\nGiven the form:\nKᵣ(s) = Fᵣ(s)/|Fᵣ(jωᵣ)|\nwhere Fᵣ(s) = (βᵣωᵣ)²/(s² + √2·βᵣωᵣ·s + (βᵣωᵣ)²)\n\nSince we have gain crossings at 12.5 and 13.4 rad/sec causing instability, I'll set ωᵣ to be lower than these crossings but still above our desired bandwidth of 1 rad/sec. A reasonable choice would be ωᵣ = 5 rad/sec.\n\nFor βᵣ, I need to ensure sufficient attenuation at the problematic frequencies. Given the requirements for phase margin (≥ 50°) and gain margin (≥ 3 dB), I'll set βᵣ = 1.5.\n\nWith these values, the roll-off element becomes:\nFᵣ(s) = (1.5 × 5)²/(s² + √2 × 1.5 × 5 × s + (1.5 × 5)²)\n      = 56.25/(s² + 10.6066s + 56.25)\n\nNow, to normalize, I need to calculate |Fᵣ(jωᵣ)| = |Fᵣ(j5)|:\nFᵣ(j5) = 56.25/((j5)² + 10.6066 × j5 + 56.25)\n       = 56.25/((-25) + 53.033j + 56.25)\n       = 56.25/(31.25 + 53.033j)\n\nThe magnitude is:\n|Fᵣ(j5)| = 56.25/√(31.25² + 53.033²) = 56.25/61.58 = 0.9134\n\nTherefore:\nKᵣ(s) = Fᵣ(s)/|Fᵣ(jωᵣ)| = Fᵣ(s)/0.9134\n       = (56.25/(s² + 10.6066s + 56.25))/0.9134\n       = 61.58/(s² + 10.6066s + 56.25)\n\nWith this roll-off element, our final controller is:\nC(s) = Kg · Ki(s) · Kᵣ(s)\n     = ((1.8955·s + 0.5994)/s) · (61.58/(s² + 10.6066s + 56.25))\n     = (1.8955·s + 0.5994) · 61.58/(s · (s² + 10.6066s + 56.25))\n     = (1.8955·s + 0.5994) · 61.58/(s³ + 10.6066s² + 56.25s)\n     = (116.7248s + 36.9090)/(s³ + 10.6066s² + 56.25s)\n\nThe actual values are:\nC_num = [116.7248, 36.9090]\nC_den = [1, 10.6066, 56.25, 0]\n\nLet me verify this is in the correct form. Since we're working with a proper transfer function representation, the final controller coefficients are:\n\nC_num = [116.7248, 36.9090]\nC_den = [1, 10.6066, 56.25, 0]\n\nI should note that I've made several design choices based on control system principles. Using ωᵣ = 5 rad/sec places the roll-off between our desired bandwidth (1 rad/sec) and the problematic gain crossings (12.5 and 13.4 rad/sec). The choice of βᵣ = 1.5 provides a good balance between attenuation rate and phase contribution. These parameters should satisfy our requirements for stability, bandwidth, phase margin, and gain margin.\n\nTherefore, my final design parameters are:\nωᵣ = 5\nβᵣ = 1.5", config=ConfigFile(C_num=[116.7248, 36.909], C_den=[1.0, 10.6066, 56.25, 0.0], omega_r=5.0, beta_r=1.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'error': 'MATLAB Error: \n  File /Users/xingang/Desktop/Engineering-Design-Benchmark/tasks/XG_11/roll_over.m, line 19, in roll_over\nArrays have incompatible sizes for this operation.\n'}, 'score': 0}
