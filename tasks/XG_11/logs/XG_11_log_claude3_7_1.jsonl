The problem states that there are additional gain crossings at 12.5 and 13.4 rad/sec, resulting in an unstable closed-loop system.\n\nThe roll-off filter needs to reduce the high-frequency gain while maintaining the desired properties at lower frequencies. A typical approach is to set the roll-off frequency ωr to be around the desired bandwidth, but slightly higher.\n\nGiven that the bandwidth should be 1 rad/sec, and we want to eliminate gain crossings at 12.5 and 13.4 rad/sec, I'll set ωr to be between these values, closer to the bandwidth:\n\nLet's try ωr = 5 rad/sec, which is above the bandwidth but below the problematic crossings.\n\nFor the damping factor βr, I'll choose βr = 1.5 to provide sufficient attenuation at high frequencies while maintaining phase margin.\n\nNow, let's calculate the roll-off element:\nKr(s) = Fr(s)/|Fr(jωr)|\nFr(s) = (βr·ωr)²/(s² + √2·βr·ωr·s + (βr·ωr)²)\n      = (1.5·5)²/(s² + √2·1.5·5·s + (1.5·5)²)\n      = 56.25/(s² + 10.607·s + 56.25)\n\nAt s = jωr = j5:\nFr(j5) = 56.25/((j5)² + √2·1.5·5·(j5) + 56.25)\n       = 56.25/((-25) + j53.033 + 56.25)\n       = 56.25/(31.25 + j53.033)\n\n|Fr(j5)| = 56.25/√(31.25² + 53.033²)\n         = 56.25/√(976.563 + 2812.5)\n         = 56.25/√3789.06\n         = 56.25/61.556\n         ≈ 0.9137\n\nSo, Kr(s) = Fr(s)/|Fr(jωr)| = Fr(s)/0.9137 = 1.0945·Fr(s)\n\nKr(s) = 1.0945 × 56.25/(s² + 10.607·s + 56.25)\n      = 61.56/(s² + 10.607·s + 56.25)\n\nNow, the final controller is C(s) = Kg × Ki(s) × Kr(s):\nC(s) = (6.287·s + 1.988)/(3.3166·s) × 61.56/(s² + 10.607·s + 56.25)\n\nMultiplying the numerators and denominators:\nC(s) = (6.287·s + 1.988) × 61.56/((3.3166·s) × (s² + 10.607·s + 56.25))\n     = (386.8·s + 122.38)/((3.3166·s) × (s² + 10.607·s + 56.25))\n     = (386.8·s + 122.38)/(3.3166·s³ + 35.18·s² + 186.56·s)\n\nSimplifying:\nC(s) = (386.8·s + 122.38)/(3.3166·s³ + 35.18·s² + 186.56·s)\n     = (386.8·s + 122.38)/(s·(3.3166·s² + 35.18·s + 186.56))\n\nFor numerical reasons, let's rescale to make the leading denominator coefficient 1:\nC(s) = (386.8·s + 122.38)/(3.3166·s·(s² + 10.607·s + 56.25))\n     = (116.62·s + 36.9)/(s·(s² + 10.607·s + 56.25))\n\nTherefore, the numerator coefficients of the final controller C(s) are [116.62, 36.9] and the denominator coefficients are [1, 10.607, 56.25, 0].\n\nActually, I need to ensure my final representation matches the required format:\n- The numerator coefficients should be [C_num[0], C_num[1]]\n- The denominator coefficients should be [C_den[0], C_den[1]]\n\nLet me recalculate to ensure I have the correct form:\n\nFinal controller: C(s) = (116.62·s + 36.9)/(s·(s² + 10.607·s + 56.25))\n                      = (116.62·s + 36.9)/(s³ + 10.607·s² + 56.25·s)\n\nSo the numerator is 116.62·s + 36.9, which gives C_num = [116.62, 36.9]\nAnd the denominator is s³ + 10.607·s² + 56.25·s = s(s² + 10.607·s + 56.25), which gives C_den = [1, 10.607, 56.25, 0]\n\nBut I notice the parameter specs suggest shapes [1,2] for both numerator and denominator, which would mean the controller should be first-order.\n\nLooking back at our solution, the controller in its simplest form is:\nC(s) = (116.62·s + 36.9)/(s³ + 10.607·s² + 56.25·s)\n\nFor the parameter format of [1,2], I believe this means a first-order controller of the form:\nC(s) = (a·s + b)/(c·s + d)\n\nSince our controller isn't truly first-order, I'll need to provide the two most significant terms for each. Given the system behavior, I'll focus on:\n\nNumerator: [116.62, 36.9]\nDenominator: [1, 10.607]\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the requirements, I believe what's needed is the final controller C(s) after applying the roll-off filter, represented in a form where both numerator and denominator have their coefficients specified.\n\nGiven that I've calculated:\nC(s) = (116.62·s + 36.9)/(s³ + 10.607·s² + 56.25·s)\n\nThe numerator is: 116.62·s + 36.9\nThe denominator is: s³ + 10.607·s² + 56.25·s\n\nSo the coefficients are:\nC_num = [116.62, 36.9]\nC_den = [1, 10.607, 56.25, 0]\n\nWith ωr = 5 and βr = 1.5 as my design choices for the roll-off filter.", config=ConfigFile(C_num=[116.62, 36.9], C_den=[1.0, 10.607, 56.25, 0.0], omega_r=5.0, beta_r=1.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'error': 'MATLAB Error: \n  File /Users/xingang/Desktop/Engineering-Design-Benchmark/tasks/XG_11/roll_over.m, line 19, in roll_over\nArrays have incompatible sizes for this operation.\n'}, 'score': 0}
