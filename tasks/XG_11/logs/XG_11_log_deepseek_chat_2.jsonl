Calculate the magnitude of the plant at the desired loop bandwidth: \\(|G(j\\omega_L)| = |G(j1)|\\).\n2. Compute the gain \\(K_g = \\frac{1}{|G(j1)|}\\).\n3. Formulate the integral boost transfer function \\(K_i(s)\\) using the given formula with \\(\\beta_b = \\sqrt{10}\\) and \\(\\omega_L = 1\\).\n4. Multiply \\(K_g\\) and \\(K_i(s)\\) to get the initial controller \\(C(s)\\).\n5. Simplify the expression to obtain the numerator and denominator coefficients of \\(C(s)\\).\n\n**Task 2: Design the roll-off element to stabilize the system**\n1. Identify the frequencies where additional gain crossings occur (12.5 and 13.4 rad/sec).\n2. Choose \\(\\omega_r\\) and \\(\\beta_r\\) for the roll-off filter to attenuate the gain at these frequencies while preserving the desired loop bandwidth and stability margins.\n3. Formulate the roll-off transfer function \\(K_r(s)\\) using the given structure.\n4. Combine the initial controller with the roll-off filter to form the final controller \\(C(s)\\).\n5. Ensure the final design meets the stability, bandwidth, phase margin, and gain margin requirements.\n\n**Final Controller Coefficients**\nThe final controller \\(C(s)\\) is obtained by combining the initial controller and the roll-off filter. The numerator and denominator coefficients are derived from this combined transfer function.', config=ConfigFile(C_num=[1.0, 1.0], C_den=[1.0, 0.0], omega_r=12.5, beta_r=0.1)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'num_passed': False, 'den_passed': False, 'stability_passed': False, 'phase_margin_passed': False, 'gain_margin_passed': False, 'score': 0.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 0.0}
