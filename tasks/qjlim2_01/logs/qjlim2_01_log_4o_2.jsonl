Rogers RO4003C is a common choice with εr = 3.55.\n\n2. **Calculate Patch Dimensions:**\n   - Use the resonant frequency formula for a rectangular patch:\n     \\[ f_r = \\frac{c}{2L\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{eff}}} \\]\n     where \\( c \\) is the speed of light, \\( L \\) is the patch length, and \\( \\epsilon_{eff} \\) is the effective permittivity.\n   - For a resonant frequency of 1.537 GHz, calculate the effective permittivity and then the patch length (L).\n   - The width (W) can be calculated using:\n     \\[ W = \\frac{c}{2f_r}\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\epsilon_r + 1}} \\]\n\n3. **Determine Substrate Height:**\n   - The substrate height (h) affects the bandwidth and impedance matching. A typical value is around 1.6 mm for Rogers materials.\n\n4. **Feed Position:**\n   - The feed position affects impedance matching. It is usually offset from the center along the x-axis. A typical offset is around 1-3 mm.\n\n5. **Check Volume Constraint:**\n   - Ensure that the ground plane size (1.5 times the maximum of length and width) fits within the 100 mm × 100 mm × 10 mm constraint.\n\n6. **Calculate Bandwidth and Gain:**\n   - Ensure the design meets the bandwidth (>= 50 MHz) and gain (>= 3 dBi) requirements.\n\n7. **Confidence Level:**\n   - Based on the calculations and typical values, assign a confidence level to the design.\n\nLet's calculate the specific values for the design parameters.", config=ConfigFile(length_mm=48.8, width_mm=37.2, height_mm=1.6, epsilon_r=3.55, feed_offset_x_mm=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 1.5766, 'S11_resonant_dB': -0.13360588186962763, 'BandwidthMHz': 0.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 1.1148786806498447}, 'score': 8.319999999999936}
