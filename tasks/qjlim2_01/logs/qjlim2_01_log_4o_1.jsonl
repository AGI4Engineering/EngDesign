{'completion_tokens': 527, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design a rectangular microstrip patch antenna that meets the given specifications, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Select Substrate Material:**\n   - Choose a Rogers low-loss laminate with a suitable relative permittivity (εr). Rogers RO4003C is a common choice with εr = 3.55.\n\n2. **Calculate Patch Dimensions:**\n   - Use the transmission line model to calculate the patch dimensions (Length and Width) for the given resonant frequency (1.537 GHz).\n   - The effective dielectric constant (εeff) and the extension in length (ΔL) due to fringing fields need to be considered.\n   - The width (W) of the patch can be calculated using:\n     \n     \\[ W = \\frac{c}{2f_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\epsilon_r + 1}} \\]\n     \n     where c is the speed of light, and f0 is the resonant frequency.\n   - The length (L) of the patch is given by:\n     \n     \\[ L = \\frac{c}{2f_0\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{eff}}} - 2\\Delta L \\]\n\n3. **Determine Substrate Height:**\n   - The height of the substrate (h) affects the bandwidth and gain. A typical value is around 1.6 mm for Rogers substrates.\n\n4. **Calculate Feed Position:**\n   - The feed position affects the input impedance. It is usually offset from the center to achieve a 50-ohm match.\n   - The feed offset (x) can be determined using:\n     \n     \\[ x = L \\sqrt{\\frac{50}{Z_{in}}} \\]\n     \n     where Zin is the input impedance at the edge of the patch.\n\n5. **Check Volume Constraint:**\n   - Ensure that the ground plane size (1.5 times the maximum of Length and Width) fits within the 100 mm × 100 mm × 10 mm constraint.\n\n6. **Evaluate Performance:**\n   - Simulate the design to ensure it meets the bandwidth and gain requirements.\n\nBased on these calculations, the following design parameters are proposed:', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=48.0, width_mm=37.0, height_mm=1.6, epsilon_r=3.55, feed_offset_x_mm=12.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 1.657, 'S11_resonant_dB': -0.9794824730987427, 'BandwidthMHz': 0.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.793629587780349}, 'score': 0.0}
