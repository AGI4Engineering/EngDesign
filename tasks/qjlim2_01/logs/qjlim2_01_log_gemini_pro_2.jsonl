Substrate height part of this.\n    *   Feed: 50-ohm coaxial pin.\n    *   Substrate: Rogers low-loss laminate.\n    *   Context: Ground Plane Size = 1.5 * max(Patch Length, Patch Width). Patch must be smaller than ground plane.\n\n2.  **Substrate Selection (epsilon_r, height_mm):**\n    *   Material: Rogers RO4350B is chosen for its low loss and well-characterized properties. Relative permittivity `epsilon_r = 3.66`.\n    *   Height (h or `height_mm`): To achieve a bandwidth of >= 50 MHz, a thicker substrate is preferred. We'll evaluate Rogers RO4350B with `h = 3.175 mm` (125 mil). This height is within the 10mm overall limit. A thicker substrate also generally helps increase bandwidth.\n\n3.  **Patch Width Calculation (W or `width_mm`):**\n    The width `W` is calculated using the formula:\n    `W = c / (2 * f_r) * sqrt(2 / (epsilon_r + 1))`\n    `W = (3e8 m/s) / (2 * 1.537e9 Hz) * sqrt(2 / (3.66 + 1))`\n    `W = 0.0975927 m * sqrt(2 / 4.66) = 0.0975927 m * sqrt(0.4291845) = 0.0975927 m * 0.6551218`\n    `W = 0.063934 m = 63.93 mm`. So, `width_mm = 63.93 mm`.\n\n4.  **Effective Dielectric Constant (epsilon_eff):**\n    `W/h = 63.93 mm / 3.175 mm = 20.135`.\n    `epsilon_eff = (epsilon_r + 1) / 2 + (epsilon_r - 1) / 2 * (1 + 12 * h / W)^(-0.5)`\n    `epsilon_eff = (3.66 + 1) / 2 + (3.66 - 1) / 2 * (1 + 12 / 20.135)^(-0.5)`\n    `epsilon_eff = 2.33 + 1.33 * (1 + 0.59602)^(-0.5) = 2.33 + 1.33 * (1.59602)^(-0.5)`\n    `epsilon_eff = 2.33 + 1.33 * 0.79245 = 2.33 + 1.05396 = 3.384`.\n\n5.  **Fringing Extension (delta_L):**\n    `delta_L / h = 0.412 * (epsilon_eff + 0.3) * (W/h + 0.264) / ((epsilon_eff - 0.258) * (W/h + 0.8))`\n    `delta_L / 3.175 = 0.412 * (3.384 + 0.3) * (20.135 + 0.264) / ((3.384 - 0.258) * (20.135 + 0.8))`\n    `delta_L / 3.175 = 0.412 * (3.684) * (20.399) / ((3.126) * (20.935))`\n    `delta_L / 3.175 = 0.412 * 75.1499 / 65.4407 = 0.412 * 1.14836 = 0.47312`\n    `delta_L = 0.47312 * 3.175 mm = 1.502 mm`.\n\n6.  **Patch Resonant Length Calculation (L or `length_mm`):**\n    The effective length `L_eff = c / (2 * f_r * sqrt(epsilon_eff))`\n    `L_eff = (3e8 m/s) / (2 * 1.537e9 Hz * sqrt(3.384)) = (3e8 m/s) / (2 * 1.537e9 Hz * 1.83956)`\n    `L_eff = (3e8 m/s) / 5660350000 = 0.05300 m = 53.00 mm`.\n    The physical length `L = L_eff - 2 * delta_L`\n    `L = 53.00 mm - 2 * 1.502 mm = 53.00 mm - 3.004 mm = 49.996 mm ≈ 50.00 mm`.\n    So, `length_mm = 50.00 mm` (this is assumed to be the resonant dimension along the x-axis).\n\n7.  **Ground Plane and Patch Size Constraint Check:**\n    *   Patch dimensions: `L = 50.00 mm`, `W = 63.93 mm`.\n    *   `max(L, W) = 63.93 mm`.\n    *   Required ground plane dimension: `1.5 * 63.93 mm = 95.90 mm`.\n    *   Ground plane size `95.90 mm x 95.90 mm` is `<= 100 mm x 100 mm`. Constraint met.\n    *   Substrate height `height_mm = 3.175 mm` is `< 10 mm`. Constraint met.\n    *   Patch size `max(L,W) = 63.93 mm`. Constraint from ground plane: `max(L,W) <= 100mm / 1.5 = 66.67 mm`. This is met (`63.93 mm < 66.67 mm`).\n\n8.  **Feed Position Calculation (`feed_offset_x_mm`):**\n    The feed is a 50-ohm coaxial pin. The offset is along the x-direction from the patch center. This implies the resonant length (`length_mm`) is along the x-axis.\n    The distance `x_0` from a radiating edge to achieve 50 ohms can be approximated by `x_0 = L_eff / 6` (assuming edge impedance of approx. 200 ohms, `asin(sqrt(50/200)) = pi/6`).\n    `x_0 = 53.00 mm / 6 = 8.833 mm`.\n    The feed offset from the center (`feed_offset_x_mm`) is `L_{phy}/2 - x_0`.\n    `feed_offset_x_mm = (50.00 mm / 2) - 8.833 mm = 25.00 mm - 8.833 mm = 16.167 mm ≈ 16.17 mm`.\n\n9.  **Other Objectives Check:**\n    *   Bandwidth: Using a thicker substrate (`h = 3.175 mm`) significantly improves bandwidth. Bandwidth is roughly proportional to `h/lambda_0`. For RO4350B with `h=3.175mm`, the bandwidth is expected to be around 5-7%, which is `(0.05 * 1.537GHz) = 76 MHz`. This meets the `>= 50 MHz` requirement.\n    *   Gain: For a patch of these dimensions (`50.00 mm x 63.93 mm`) on RO4350B, gain is typically 5-7 dBi, which meets the `>= 3 dBi` requirement. The increased height helps radiation efficiency.\n\n10. **Final Design Parameters:** Based on the calculations and considerations above.", config=ConfigFile(length_mm=50.0, width_mm=63.93, height_mm=3.175, epsilon_r=3.66, feed_offset_x_mm=16.17)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 1.417, 'S11_resonant_dB': -5.148947298516498, 'BandwidthMHz': 0.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 5.0449924636156265}, 'score': 20.0}
