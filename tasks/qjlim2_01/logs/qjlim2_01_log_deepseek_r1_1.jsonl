{'completion_tokens': 8337, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The design starts by selecting Rogers RO3003 laminate (epsilon_r=3.0) for its balance between permittivity and bandwidth. Substrate height is chosen as 6.35 mm (standard thickness) to increase bandwidth. Patch width (66 mm) is calculated using the microstrip formula, ensuring ground plane size (99 mm) fits within 100 mm. Length (53.36 mm) accounts for fringing fields. Feed offset (8.9 mm from center) is estimated to achieve 50-ohm impedance. Bandwidth (~51.8 MHz) and gain (>3 dBi) meet requirements. Confidence is 80% due to approximations in feed position and empirical formulas.', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=53.36, width_mm=66.0, height_mm=6.35, epsilon_r=3.0, feed_offset_x_mm=8.9)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 1.4974, 'S11_resonant_dB': -16.977116709831066, 'BandwidthMHz': 76.8, 'MaxGaindBi': 5.831193482812232}, 'score': 68.3200000000001}
