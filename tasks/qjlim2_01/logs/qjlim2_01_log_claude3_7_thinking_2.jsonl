{'completion_tokens': 11945, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a rectangular microstrip patch antenna for 1.537 GHz, I need to calculate the optimal dimensions while meeting multiple constraints including bandwidth, gain, and maximum volume.\n\nFirst, I need to select an appropriate substrate material. Rogers low-loss laminates offer various permittivity values. For wider bandwidth, I'll choose RT/duroid 5880 with εr = 2.20, which has one of the lowest available dielectric constants. This will help maximize bandwidth.\n\nNext, I'll determine the patch dimensions:\n\n1. Calculate patch width (W):\n   W = c/(2×f₀×√((εr+1)/2))\n   W = (3×10⁸)/(2×1.537×10⁹×√((2.20+1)/2))\n   W = (3×10⁸)/(2×1.537×10⁹×√1.6)\n   W = (3×10⁸)/(2×1.537×10⁹×1.265)\n   W = 77.1 mm\n\n2. For volume constraints, I need to ensure ground plane size ≤ 100 mm:\n   Ground plane = 1.5×max(L,W)\n   The maximum patch width possible is 66.67 mm to keep ground plane ≤ 100 mm\n\n3. Calculate effective dielectric constant (εr_eff):\n   With W = 66.67 mm and substrate height = 6.35 mm (maximizing height within constraints):\n   εr_eff = 2.01\n\n4. Calculate length extension (ΔL):\n   ΔL = 3.29 mm\n\n5. Calculate effective length (Leff):\n   Leff = c/(2×f₀×√εr_eff)\n   Leff = 68.8 mm\n\n6. Calculate actual patch length (L):\n   L = Leff - 2×ΔL = 68.8 - 2×3.29 = 62.22 mm\n\n7. Determine feed position:\n   Placing the feed at approximately L/6 from center:\n   feed_offset_x_mm = 62.22/6 = 10.37 mm\n\nBandwidth calculation:\nBW ≈ 3.77×(εr-1)/(εr²×√εr)×(W/L)×(h/λ₀) ≈ 33.66 MHz\n\nWhile this doesn't quite reach the 50 MHz bandwidth requirement, it's the best compromise given the volume constraints. The design will meet the gain requirement of ≥3 dBi (typical microstrip patches achieve 5-8 dBi) and all other specifications.", config=ConfigFile(length_mm=62.22, width_mm=66.67, height_mm=6.35, epsilon_r=2.2, feed_offset_x_mm=10.37)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 1.5766, 'S11_resonant_dB': -5.332849107910656, 'BandwidthMHz': 0.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 6.124621879022579}, 'score': 28.319999999999936}
