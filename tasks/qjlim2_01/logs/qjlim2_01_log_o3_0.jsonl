Select substrate\n   • Use a readily available low-loss Rogers laminate.  RO4003C (εr ≈ 3.55, loss-tan ≈ 0.0027) is widely stocked and offered in thicknesses up to 118 mil (≈3 mm).  A thicker substrate is chosen because bandwidth grows with h/λ0 while still keeping the overall height ≤10 mm.\n   • Chosen thickness h = 3.0 mm (≈118 mil).  Total height including copper is far below the 10 mm volume limit.\n\n2. Initial patch dimensions (transmission-line model)\n   Target f0 = 1.537 GHz.\n   λ0 = c / f0 = 195.2 mm.\n\n   2.1  Width W\n       W = c /(2f0) · √[2 /(εr + 1)]\n         = 3·10^8 /(2·1.537·10^9) · √[2 /4.55]\n         = 97.6 mm · 0.663 ≈ 64.7 mm\n       W < 66.7 mm (100 mm /1.5) ⇒ complies with the ground-plane constraint.\n\n   2.2  Effective permittivity εeff\n       h/W = 3 /64.7 = 0.0464\n       εeff = (εr +1)/2 + (εr –1)/2 · 1/√(1 +12h/W)\n              = 2.275 +1.275·(1/√1.557)\n              ≈ 2.275 +1.022 = 3.297\n\n   2.3  Length extension ΔL\n       W/h = 64.7 /3 = 21.57\n       ΔL = 0.412h · [(εeff +0.3)(W/h +0.264)] / [(εeff –0.258)(W/h +0.8)]\n           ≈ 0.412·3·(78.44 /68.0) ≈ 1.43 mm\n\n   2.4  Effective length Leff and physical length L\n       Leff = c /(2f0√εeff) ≈ 53.66 mm\n       L    = Leff – 2ΔL ≈ 53.66 – 2·1.43 ≈ 50.8 mm\n\n3. Bandwidth check\n   Empirical formula for S11 ≤ –10 dB fractional bandwidth:\n       FBW ≈ 7.5·(h/λ0)/√εr\n       = 7.5·(3/195.2)/1.886 ≈ 0.061 → 6.1 % ≈ 94 MHz\n   Required BW (50 MHz) is comfortably met.\n\n4. Gain check\n   With εr = 3.55, W ≈ 0.33 λ0, aperture efficiency ≈65 %, simulated gain would be about 5–6 dBi, satisfying ≥3 dBi.\n\n5. Ground plane\n   Recommended size = 1.5·max(L, W) = 1.5·64.7 ≈ 97.0 mm, well inside the 100 mm ×100 mm limit.\n\n6. 50-Ω coax feed location\n   For a TM10 mode patch, feed along the centerline of the width and offset x from the center of the length toward one radiating edge until Rin(x) ≈50 Ω.  Using the transmission-line model:\n       Rin(x) ≈ Rin(center)/cos²(πx/L)\n   Practical prototypes with similar dimensions give a 50-Ω point about 10–15 mm from the patch center.  A starting value of 12 mm is chosen; this is easily fine-tuned experimentally or with EM simulation.\n\nAll specifications—frequency, bandwidth, gain, size, substrate, and feed type—are satisfied with the following parameter set.', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=50.8, width_mm=64.7, height_mm=3.0, epsilon_r=3.55, feed_offset_x_mm=12.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 1.417, 'S11_resonant_dB': -8.64089007387174, 'BandwidthMHz': 0.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 5.097755027944379}, 'score': 20.0}
