The Rogers RO4003C is a common low-loss laminate with εr ≈ 3.38.\n\n2) For a resonant frequency of 1.537 GHz, I'll calculate the width of the patch:\nW = c/(2*fr*sqrt((εr+1)/2))\nW = 3×10^8/(2×1.537×10^9×sqrt((3.38+1)/2))\nW = 60.1 mm\n\n3) For the height, I need to balance between bandwidth and volume constraints. Rogers RO4003C is available in various thicknesses. A thickness of 1.524 mm (60 mil) is a good choice for this frequency range to provide adequate bandwidth while staying well within the 10 mm height constraint.\n\n4) Calculate the effective dielectric constant:\nεr_eff = (εr+1)/2 + (εr-1)/2 × [1+12×(h/W)]^(-1/2)\nεr_eff = (3.38+1)/2 + (3.38-1)/2 × [1+12×(1.524/60.1)]^(-1/2)\nεr_eff ≈ 3.27\n\n5) Calculate the extension length due to fringing effects:\nΔL = 0.412×h×(εr_eff+0.3)×(W/h+0.264)/((εr_eff-0.258)×(W/h+0.8))\nΔL = 0.412×1.524×(3.27+0.3)×(60.1/1.524+0.264)/((3.27-0.258)×(60.1/1.524+0.8))\nΔL ≈ 0.7 mm\n\n6) Calculate the actual length of the patch:\nL = c/(2×fr×sqrt(εr_eff)) - 2×ΔL\nL = 3×10^8/(2×1.537×10^9×sqrt(3.27)) - 2×0.7\nL = 49.1 mm\n\n7) For the feed position, I'll place it offset from the center along the x-axis to achieve a good impedance match to 50 ohms. Typically, this is around 1/3 of the patch length from the edge. Since our coordinate system has the patch centered at the origin, the feed offset from the center would be:\nfeed_offset_x_mm = -L/6 ≈ -8.2 mm\n\n8) Checking ground plane size: max(L,W) = max(49.1, 60.1) = 60.1 mm\n   Ground plane size = 1.5 × 60.1 = 90.15 mm\n   This is within the 100 mm × 100 mm constraint.\n\n9) Final design validation:\n   - Patch dimensions (49.1 mm × 60.1 mm) are smaller than ground plane\n   - Total height is 1.524 mm, well within 10 mm constraint\n   - The design should provide the required gain of ≥3 dBi at 1.537 GHz\n   - The bandwidth should meet ≥50 MHz with the selected substrate height\n\nThese parameters should provide a suitable design for the specified constraints and requirements.", config=ConfigFile(length_mm=49.1, width_mm=60.1, height_mm=1.524, epsilon_r=3.38, feed_offset_x_mm=-8.2)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 1.5766, 'S11_resonant_dB': -12.108963835505264, 'BandwidthMHz': 42.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 3.516837002512875}, 'score': 48.319999999999936}
