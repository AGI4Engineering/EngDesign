{'completion_tokens': 10638, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The design process begins by selecting Rogers RO4350B (ε_r=3.48) as the substrate, which is a commercially available low-loss laminate. The patch width (W) is calculated using the standard formula for microstrip antennas to achieve resonance at 1.537 GHz, resulting in 65.2 mm. The effective permittivity and fringing effects are accounted for to determine the patch length (L) as 52 mm. The ground plane size (1.5×max(L,W)) is 97.8 mm, meeting the ≤100 mm constraint. The feed offset is calculated using input impedance matching to position it 19.9 mm from the center along the x-axis. The substrate height is chosen as 1.524 mm (60 mil), a standard thickness for RO4350B. While this design meets the resonant frequency and size constraints, the bandwidth may fall short of 50 MHz due to substrate limitations, resulting in moderate confidence.', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=52.0, width_mm=65.2, height_mm=1.524, epsilon_r=3.48, feed_offset_x_mm=-19.9)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 1.4974, 'S11_resonant_dB': -3.225256949257504, 'BandwidthMHz': 0.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 5.353524387292177}, 'score': 28.320000000000114}
