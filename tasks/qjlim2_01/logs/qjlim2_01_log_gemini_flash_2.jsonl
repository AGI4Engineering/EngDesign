{'completion_tokens': 312, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design a rectangular microstrip patch antenna, I need to determine the appropriate length, width, substrate height, permittivity, and feed position. The target resonant frequency is 1.537 GHz, and I will aim for a bandwidth of at least 50 MHz and a gain of at least 3 dBi, all while adhering to the volume constraint.  I will use common microstrip antenna design equations and make reasonable material choices. I will select Rogers RO4350B as the substrate material because it is widely used, has a relatively low loss tangent, and a permittivity around 3.66. First, I will calculate the width of the patch antenna. Then, I can calculate the effective permittivity and the length extension, and finally determine the actual length of the patch. The feed position is important for impedance matching and will be determined based on empirical formulas. The ground plane size will be determined based on the max(length, width). After the initial calculations, these parameters can be fine-tuned using electromagnetic simulation software, but this is outside the scope of this problem.', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=27.5, width_mm=36.0, height_mm=1.524, epsilon_r=3.66, feed_offset_x_mm=9.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.137, 'S11_resonant_dB': -0.08996019251580424, 'BandwidthMHz': 0.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.7172459665879907}, 'score': 0.0}
