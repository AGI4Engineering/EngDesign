First, I need to select an appropriate Rogers substrate material. I'll choose RO4360G2 with εr = 6.15 as it provides a good balance between size and performance. Lower permittivity materials would give better bandwidth but result in a larger antenna, while higher permittivity materials would make the antenna more compact but potentially reduce bandwidth and efficiency.\n\n2. For the substrate height, I'll use a standard Rogers thickness of 1.524 mm (60 mil), which is commonly available and provides adequate bandwidth.\n\n3. Calculating the patch width using the formula:\nW = (c / (2 * f_r)) * sqrt(2 / (εr + 1))\nW = (3 × 10^8) / (2 × 1.537 × 10^9) × sqrt(2 / (6.15 + 1))\nW = 97.59 × sqrt(2 / 7.15)\nW = 97.59 × 0.529\nW = 51.63 mm\n\n4. Calculating the effective dielectric constant:\nεr_eff = ((εr + 1) / 2) + ((εr - 1) / 2) * (1 + 12 * h / W)^(-0.5)\nεr_eff = ((6.15 + 1) / 2) + ((6.15 - 1) / 2) * (1 + 12 * 1.524 / 51.63)^(-0.5)\nεr_eff = 3.575 + 2.575 * 0.844\nεr_eff = 5.748\n\n5. Calculating the length extension:\nΔL = 0.412 * h * ((εr_eff + 0.3) * (W/h + 0.264)) / ((εr_eff - 0.258) * (W/h + 0.8))\nΔL = 0.628 * 206.24 / 189.95\nΔL = 0.682 mm\n\n6. Calculating the effective and actual patch length:\nL_eff = c / (2 * f_r * sqrt(εr_eff))\nL_eff = 97.59 / 2.397\nL_eff = 40.71 mm\n\nL = L_eff - 2 * ΔL\nL = 40.71 - 1.364\nL = 39.35 mm\n\n7. For the feed position to match 50-ohm impedance:\nUsing R_edge = 180 ohms and the formula:\n50 = 180 * cos²(π*y/39.35)\nSolving for y gives 7.0 mm from the edge\nfeed_offset_x_mm = (L/2) - 7.0 = 19.68 - 7.0 = 12.68 mm\n\n8. Verifying all constraints:\n- Ground plane size = 1.5 * max(39.35, 51.63) = 77.45 mm × 77.45 mm, well within our 100 mm × 100 mm constraint\n- The height is 1.524 mm, well within the 10 mm constraint\n- The resonant frequency is designed for 1.537 GHz\n- The chosen substrate and dimensions should provide the required bandwidth (≥ 50 MHz) and gain (≥ 3 dBi)", config=ConfigFile(length_mm=39.35, width_mm=51.63, height_mm=1.524, epsilon_r=6.15, feed_offset_x_mm=12.68)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 1.3366, 'S11_resonant_dB': -0.9140940496685412, 'BandwidthMHz': 0.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 3.153132629313909}, 'score': 20.0}
