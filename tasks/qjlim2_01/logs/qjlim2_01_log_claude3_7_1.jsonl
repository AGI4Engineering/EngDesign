Let me approach this systematically:\n\n1) First, let's select an appropriate Rogers substrate material. Rogers offers several low-loss laminates, but common choices include RT/duroid 5880 (εr = 2.2), RT/duroid 6002 (εr = 2.94), and RO4350B (εr = 3.48). For a 1.537 GHz application, I'll select RT/duroid 5880 with εr = 2.2 as lower permittivity generally provides better bandwidth and radiation efficiency.\n\n2) For the substrate height, I want to balance bandwidth and efficiency against surface wave losses. Given the volume constraint of 10mm maximum height, and the need for ≥50 MHz bandwidth, I'll choose a substrate height of 3.175 mm (125 mils), which is a standard thickness for Rogers laminates.\n\n3) Now I'll calculate the width of the patch using the standard formula:\nW = (c/(2*fr))*sqrt(2/(εr+1))\nWhere:\n- c = 3×10^8 m/s (speed of light)\n- fr = 1.537 GHz\n- εr = 2.2\nW = (3×10^8/(2×1.537×10^9))×sqrt(2/(2.2+1)) = 76.2 mm\n\n4) To calculate the length, I need to account for the fringing effect:\nFirst, calculate the effective dielectric constant:\nεeff = (εr+1)/2 + (εr-1)/2 × [1 + 12×(h/W)]^(-1/2)\nεeff = (2.2+1)/2 + (2.2-1)/2 × [1 + 12×(3.175/76.2)]^(-1/2) ≈ 2.17\n\nThen calculate the length extension:\nΔL = 0.412 × h × (εeff+0.3)×(W/h+0.264)/((εeff-0.258)×(W/h+0.8))\nΔL = 0.412 × 3.175 × (2.17+0.3)×(76.2/3.175+0.264)/((2.17-0.258)×(76.2/3.175+0.8)) ≈ 1.58 mm\n\nEffective length:\nLeff = c/(2×fr×sqrt(εeff))\nLeff = 3×10^8/(2×1.537×10^9×sqrt(2.17)) = 66.5 mm\n\nActual length:\nL = Leff - 2×ΔL = 66.5 - 2×1.58 = 63.34 mm\n\n5) For the feed position, I need to match the input impedance to 50 ohms. The impedance is highest at the edges and lowest (typically around 0 ohms) at the center. For a rectangular patch, the offset from the center along the length dimension determines the input impedance. Based on experience, an offset of approximately 20-30% of the length from the center will often yield close to 50 ohms. I'll place the feed at approximately -13 mm offset from the center along the x-direction (assuming length is along x-axis).\n\nThis gives us the following design parameters:\n- Length of patch (length_mm): 63.34 mm\n- Width of patch (width_mm): 76.2 mm\n- Substrate height (height_mm): 3.175 mm\n- Relative permittivity (epsilon_r): 2.2\n- Feed position offset in x (feed_offset_x_mm): -13 mm\n\nThis design meets the volume constraint as the ground plane size would be 1.5 × max(63.34, 76.2) = 1.5 × 76.2 = 114.3 mm, which exceeds our 100 mm constraint. Let me adjust the design to meet this constraint.\n\nTo meet the 100 mm ground plane constraint, the maximum patch dimension must be less than 100/1.5 = 66.67 mm. Let me recalculate with a slightly higher permittivity material, RT/duroid 6002 with εr = 2.94, which will reduce the patch dimensions:\n\nRecalculating with εr = 2.94:\nW = (3×10^8/(2×1.537×10^9))×sqrt(2/(2.94+1)) = 67.2 mm\n\nεeff = (2.94+1)/2 + (2.94-1)/2 × [1 + 12×(3.175/67.2)]^(-1/2) ≈ 2.84\n\nΔL = 0.412 × 3.175 × (2.84+0.3)×(67.2/3.175+0.264)/((2.84-0.258)×(67.2/3.175+0.8)) ≈ 1.49 mm\n\nLeff = 3×10^8/(2×1.537×10^9×sqrt(2.84)) = 58.1 mm\n\nL = 58.1 - 2×1.49 = 55.12 mm\n\nFeed offset: approximately -11 mm\n\nNow, max(55.12, 67.2) = 67.2, so the ground plane would be 1.5 × 67.2 = 100.8 mm, which is very close to our constraint. Let me make a minor adjustment to ensure we're exactly within bounds:\n\nSlightly reducing the width to 66.67 mm, our final design parameters are:\n- Length of patch (length_mm): 55 mm\n- Width of patch (width_mm): 66.6 mm\n- Substrate height (height_mm): 3.175 mm\n- Relative permittivity (epsilon_r): 2.94\n- Feed position offset in x (feed_offset_x_mm): -11 mm", config=ConfigFile(length_mm=55.0, width_mm=66.6, height_mm=3.175, epsilon_r=2.94, feed_offset_x_mm=-11.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 1.657, 'S11_resonant_dB': -0.2625928715951384, 'BandwidthMHz': 0.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 6.163477831424917}, 'score': 20.0}
