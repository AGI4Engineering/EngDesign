{'completion_tokens': 7997, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='We implement the read function in several steps. First, we resolve the file path by splitting on slash, starting at the root inode with number 1, and traversing the directory entries stored in fs_img.directories. If any component is missing, we raise FileNotFoundError. Once we obtain the target inode number, we retrieve its Inode object; if not found or if it refers to a directory, we raise the appropriate error. Next, we validate the given position against the file size. We compute the end position as the minimum of pos plus length and the file size so that we do not read past EOF. We determine block_size from fs_img.superblock, then calculate the start and end block indices by integer division of offsets. We initialize a bytearray accumulator and iterate from start_block to end_block inclusive. For each block, we fetch its content from fs_img.data_blocks or default to empty bytes if uninitialized. We slice out the part of the block relevant to the requested range, handling the first and last block specially, and extend our accumulator. Finally, we decode the accumulated bytes as UTF-8 to obtain the string result.', config=ConfigFile(read="def read(fs_img: FileSystemImage, name: str, pos: int, length: int) -> str:\n    '''Read up to `length` bytes from the file called `name` in the given FileSystemImage, starting at byte offset `pos`, and return the data as a Python string (decoded as UTF-8).'''\n    def resolve_path(path: str) -> int:\n        if path.startswith('/'):\n            current_ino = 1  # start at root\n            parts = [p for p in path.strip('/').split('/') if p]\n        else:\n            current_ino = 1\n            parts = [p for p in path.split('/') if p]\n        for part in parts:\n            if current_ino not in fs_img.directories:\n                raise FileNotFoundError(f'Path component {part} not found')\n            found = False\n            for entry in fs_img.directories[current_ino]:\n                if entry.name == part:\n                    current_ino = entry.inode\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if not found:\n                raise FileNotFoundError(f'Path component {part} not found')\n        return current_ino\n    inode_num = resolve_path(name)\n    inode = fs_img.inodes.get(inode_num)\n    if inode is None:\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f'File {name} not found')\n    if inode.is_dir:\n        raise IsADirectoryError(f'{name} is a directory')\n    if pos < 0 or pos > inode.size:\n        raise ValueError('Position out of range')\n    end_pos = min(pos + length, inode.size)\n    block_size = fs_img.superblock.block_size\n    start_block = pos // block_size\n    end_block = (end_pos - 1) // block_size if end_pos > 0 else start_block\n    data = bytearray()\n    for blk_idx in range(start_block, end_block + 1):\n        if blk_idx >= len(inode.direct_blocks):\n            break\n        block_num = inode.direct_blocks[blk_idx]\n        block_data = fs_img.data_blocks[block_num] or b''\n        start_off = (pos % block_size) if blk_idx == start_block else 0\n        end_off = ((end_pos - 1) % block_size) + 1 if blk_idx == end_block else len(block_data)\n        data.extend(block_data[start_off:end_off])\n    return data.decode('utf-8')")), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'read_root_file': "Failed: expected b'Hello', got Hello", 'read_subdir_file': "Failed: expected b'Hello', got Hello", 'read': 'Failed', 'content correctness': 'Failed', 'read_invalid': 'Passed: exception raised as expected'}, 'score': 20}
