This stub includes the function signature, type hints, a detailed multiline docstring, and a placeholder comment for the implementation (`# Your implementation here...`).\n2.  **Extract the Code Block**: The entire Python code for the `read` function is copied verbatim from the input. This includes all original formatting, indentation, and special characters (like \'â€‘\' and \'â€¦\').\n3.  **Format as JSON String**: The extracted Python code is then embedded as a single string value associated with the `"read"` key within the `"config"` object.\n    -   Newline characters in the Python code are represented as `\\n` in the JSON string.\n    -   Double quotes (`"`) that are part of the Python code (specifically, the triple double quotes `"""` delimiting the docstring) must be escaped as `\\"` within the JSON string to ensure the JSON string itself is valid.\n    -   Other special characters like \'â€‘\' (U+2011 NON-BREAKING HYPHEN) and \'â€¦\' (U+2026 HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS) are preserved as their UTF-8 representations, as JSON strings natively support UTF-8.\n4.  **Construct Final JSON**: The `reasoning` field describes these steps, and the `config` field holds the extracted data, adhering to the provided JSON schema.', config=ConfigFile(read='def read(fs_img: FileSystemImage, name: str, pos: int, length: int) -> str:\n    """\n    Read up to `length` bytes from the file called `name` in the given FileSystemImage,\n    starting at byte offset `pos`, and return the data as a Python string (decoded as UTFâ€‘8).\n\n    Parameters:\n    - fs_img: the FileSystemImage instance containing inodes, directories, and data blocks.\n    - name: an absolute or relative path to the target file within `fs_img`.\n    - pos: the byte offset within the file at which to begin reading.\n    - length: the maximum number of bytes to read.\n\n    Returns:\n    - A Python `str` containing the bytes read, decoded from UTFâ€‘8.\n\n    Behavior:\n    1.
