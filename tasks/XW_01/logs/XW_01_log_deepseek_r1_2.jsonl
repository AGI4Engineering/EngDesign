{'completion_tokens': 14020, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The read function is implemented by first resolving the file's path through the directory structure, validating the input parameters, and then reading the appropriate data blocks. The steps are:\n1. Split the path into components and traverse from the root inode (1).\n2. For each component, check if the current inode is a directory and if the entry exists.\n3. After resolving the final component, check if it's a file and validate the position.\n4. Calculate the read length considering the file's size.\n5.
