{'completion_tokens': 167, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The diameter `D` of the shaft needs to be large enough to resist the applied torque `T` while limiting the twist angle `phi` to less than 0.05 rad. A larger diameter increases the torsional stiffness of the shaft, reducing the twist angle.  I'm going to propose `D=50mm` as a starting point, and assume it will be evaluated. It's large enough to intuitively be stiff but still plausible for the length of 1000mm. Since I don't have any simulation capabilities now I'm just making an educated guess that would likely meet the condition and be a good starting point to get good score.", config=ConfigFile(Th=50.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'phi': 0.02017781526132677, 'threshold': 0.05}, 'score': 57.65090074664791}
