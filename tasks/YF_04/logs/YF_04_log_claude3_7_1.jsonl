{'completion_tokens': 1107, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I need to determine the appropriate diameter for a solid cylindrical steel shaft with a maximum allowable twist angle of 0.05 rad. The optimal scoring range is between 70-90% of this threshold (0.035-0.045 rad). Using the torsion formula φ = (T·L)/(G·J), where G = E/(2(1+ν)) = 80,769.23 MPa and J = (π·D⁴)/32 for a solid circular shaft, I can solve for the diameter. Substituting the given values (T = 1,000,000 N·mm, L = 1000 mm), I calculate D = 42.31 mm for a twist angle of 0.04 rad (80% of threshold). I rounded up to D = 43 mm for safety, which gives a twist angle of approximately 0.038 rad (76% of threshold), well within the optimal scoring range.', config=ConfigFile(Th=43.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'phi': 0.0368875946225862, 'threshold': 0.05}, 'score': 100.0}
