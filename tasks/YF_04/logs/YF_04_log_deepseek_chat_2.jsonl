{'completion_tokens': 242, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To determine a suitable diameter for the solid cylindrical steel shaft, we need to ensure that the maximum twist angle ϕ does not exceed 0.05 rad under the applied torque T=1×10^6 N·mm. The twist angle ϕ for a solid cylindrical shaft can be calculated using the formula: ϕ = (T * L) / (G * J), where G is the shear modulus and J is the polar moment of inertia. The shear modulus G can be derived from the given Young’s modulus (E=210,000 MPa) and Poisson’s ratio (ν=0.3) as G = E / (2*(1+ν)) ≈ 80,769 MPa. The polar moment of inertia J for a solid cylinder is J = (π * d^4) / 32. Substituting these into the twist angle formula and solving for d to ensure ϕ ≤ 0.05 rad, we get d ≈ 50 mm. This diameter should provide sufficient stiffness to keep the twist angle within the allowable limit while being structurally sound.', config=ConfigFile(Th=50.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'phi': 0.02017781526132677, 'threshold': 0.05}, 'score': 57.65090074664791}
