{'completion_tokens': 6039, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The task requires determining a suitable diameter (D) for a solid cylindrical steel shaft subjected to torque, ensuring the maximum twist angle (ϕ) is between 70% and 90% of 0.05 rad. Using the torsion formula ϕ = (T * L) / (G * J), where J = πD⁴/32 and G = E / [2(1 + ν)], the calculations show that D must be in the range of ~41–43.6 mm to satisfy 0.035 ≤ ϕ ≤ 0.045 rad. A value of D = 42 mm is selected as a midpoint in this range. This balances stiffness and geometric constraints, ensuring the twist angle falls within the scoring criteria while avoiding over- or under-design.', config=ConfigFile(Th=42.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'phi': 0.040528170291472015, 'threshold': 0.05}, 'score': 100.0}
