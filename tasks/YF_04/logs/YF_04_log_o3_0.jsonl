{'completion_tokens': 1223, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='We need a solid circular shaft (cantilever) that under a torque of 1×10^6 N·mm and length 1 000 mm does not exceed the prescribed twist-angle envelope, and we would like the simulated twist φ to land inside 70 %–90 % of the 0.05 rad limit (i.e. 0.035–0.045 rad) to obtain full score.  \n\n1. Governing equation for a solid shaft in linear elasticity: φ = T L / (G J) with J = π D⁴ / 32.  \n2. Shear modulus: G = E/[2(1+ν)] = 210 000 MPa / [2(1+0.3)] ≈ 80 770 MPa (N/mm²).  \n3. Solve D so that φ ≈ 0.04 rad (mid-range, 80 % of the limit):  \n   D⁴ ≥ (T L · 32)/(G π φ)  \n   = (1 ×10⁶ N·mm × 1 000 mm × 32)/(80 770 × π × 0.04)  \n   ≈ 3.16 ×10⁶  \n   ⇒ D ≈ (3.16 ×10⁶)^(1/4) ≈ 42 mm.  \n4. A 42 mm diameter gives a predicted φ ≈ 0.04 rad, squarely in the 70 %–90 % window; it also keeps stresses far below yield for typical structural steels, so the design is both stiff and safe.  \n5. Therefore I propose a shaft diameter of 42 mm (taken here as the ‘thickness’ parameter requested by the schema).', config=ConfigFile(Th=42.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'phi': 0.040528170291472015, 'threshold': 0.05}, 'score': 100.0}
