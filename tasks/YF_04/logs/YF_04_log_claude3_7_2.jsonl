Using the torsion formula φ = TL/(GJ), where G = E/[2(1+ν)] = 80,769.23 MPa and J = (π × D⁴)/32 for a solid circular shaft, I can solve for diameter. Targeting a twist angle of 0.04 rad (80% of allowable), I calculated D = 42.22 mm. I rounded to 42 mm, which gives a twist angle of 0.0409 rad (81.8% of the limit), placing it well within the optimal 70%-90% range to earn full points.', config=ConfigFile(Th=42.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'phi': 0.040528170291472015, 'threshold': 0.05}, 'score': 100.0}
