{'completion_tokens': 2575, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To determine the suitable diameter D, the angle of twist formula ϕ = (T*L)/(G*J) was used, where T is torque, L is length, G is shear modulus, and J is polar moment of inertia. Shear modulus G was calculated as E/(2*(1+ν)) ≈ 80,769 MPa. J for a solid cylinder is πD⁴/32. Rearranging for D, D = [(32*T*L)/(π*G*ϕ)]^(1/4). Targeting ϕ ≈ 0.045 rad (90% of 0.05 rad to maximize stiffness efficiency while staying within the 70-90% scoring range), D ≈ 41 mm was derived. This balances stiffness, loading constraints, and geometric efficiency, ensuring the twist angle ratio falls within the optimal scoring range.', config=ConfigFile(Th=41.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'phi': 0.044629161979124324, 'threshold': 0.05}, 'score': 100.0}
