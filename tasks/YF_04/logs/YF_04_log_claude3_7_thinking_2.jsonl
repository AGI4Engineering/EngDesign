I aimed for 80% of the threshold, which is 0.04 rad.\n\nSolving for D: 0.04 = (32×10^9)/(80,769.23×π×D^4), which gives D = 42.13 mm\n\nVerifying this result: With D = 42 mm, the twist angle is approximately 0.0405 rad, which is 81% of the threshold, falling within the optimal scoring range.\n\nA diameter of 42 mm provides adequate torsional stiffness while meeting the performance criteria for optimal scoring.", config=ConfigFile(Th=42.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'phi': 0.040528170291472015, 'threshold': 0.05}, 'score': 100.0}
