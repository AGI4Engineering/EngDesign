{'completion_tokens': 973, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='For a cylindrical shaft under torsion, I used the torsion formula: φ = (T × L) / (G × J), where G is the shear modulus and J is the polar moment of inertia. Given L = 1000 mm, T = 1×10^6 N·mm, E = 210,000 MPa, and ν = 0.3, I calculated G = 80,769 MPa. To get full points, the twist angle needs to be 70-90% of the maximum allowed 0.05 rad, or 0.035-0.045 rad. I targeted φ = 0.04 rad (80% of max) and solved for diameter: D^4 = (32 × T × L) / (G × π × φ). This gave D ≈ 42.25 mm, which I rounded to 42 mm. Verification showed this would result in a twist angle of 0.0408 rad, which is 81.6% of the maximum allowed and within our target range.', config=ConfigFile(Th=42.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'phi': 0.040528170291472015, 'threshold': 0.05}, 'score': 100.0}
