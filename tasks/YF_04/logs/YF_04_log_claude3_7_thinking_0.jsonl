{'completion_tokens': 19797, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To determine the appropriate diameter for the steel shaft, I analyzed the torsional behavior using the equation φ = T·L/(G·J), where φ is the twist angle, T is torque, L is length, G is shear modulus, and J is the polar moment of inertia. For a solid circular shaft, J = (π·D^4)/32. The shear modulus G = E/[2(1+ν)] = 210,000/[2(1+0.3)] = 80,769.23 MPa. To maximize scoring, I aimed for a twist angle of 80% of the maximum allowable (0.04 rad). Solving the equation D^4 = 32·T·L/(G·π·φ) with the given values (T = 1×10^6 N·mm, L = 1000 mm), I calculated D = 42.0 mm. This diameter produces a twist angle of 0.0405 rad, which is 81% of the maximum allowable value, well within the optimal 70-90% range for scoring.', config=ConfigFile(Th=42.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'phi': 0.040528170291472015, 'threshold': 0.05}, 'score': 100.0}
