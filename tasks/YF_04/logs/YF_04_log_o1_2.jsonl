{'completion_tokens': 1940, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A convenient way to estimate the diameter is to use the classical torsion formula for a solid round shaft, where the twist angle ϕ is (T L)/(G J) and J = (π d⁴)/32. Substituting T = 1×10⁶ N·mm, L = 1000 mm, and G ≈ E / [2 (1 + ν)] = 210000 / [2.6] MPa yields a diameter of about 42 mm to keep the maximum twist angle around 80% of the 0.05 rad threshold. This places the design within the desired 70–90% range, making it sufficiently stiff but not overly large.', config=ConfigFile(Th=42.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'phi': 0.040528170291472015, 'threshold': 0.05}, 'score': 100.0}
