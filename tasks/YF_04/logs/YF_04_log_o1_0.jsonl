{'completion_tokens': 4215, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='After performing a rough torsion‐stiffness check, one can estimate the maximum twist ϕ in a circular shaft using the formula ϕ = (T × L)/(G ×J), where T is the applied torque, L is the shaft length, G = E / [2(1+ν)] is the shear modulus (about 80\u202fGPa for steel with E = 210\u202fGPa and ν = 0.3), and J = π·D⁴/32 is the torsional second moment of area for a solid round cross‐section. Working in consistent units, a diameter around 42\xa0mm yields a computed twist angle just below the 0.05\u202frad limit, on the order of about 0.04\u202frad. This ensures the design falls inside the 70%–90% “sweet spot.” A slightly smaller diameter would approach the maximum allowable twist angle and risk incurring a penalty, whereas a much larger diameter would reduce the twist too far below 70% and only earn partial credit. The recommended 42\xa0mm diameter thus strikes a good balance between minimizing torsional deflection and ensuring an adequate twist ratio for maximum scoring.', config=ConfigFile(Th=42.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'phi': 0.040528170291472015, 'threshold': 0.05}, 'score': 100.0}
