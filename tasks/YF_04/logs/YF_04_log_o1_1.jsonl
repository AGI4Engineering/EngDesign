{'completion_tokens': 2626, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A practical way to arrive at a diameter for the shaft is to use the classical torsion formula for the angle of twist, ϕ = T·L / (G·J). Here, G = E / (2(1+ν)) is the shear modulus, and for a solid round shaft of diameter D, the polar moment of inertia J = π·D^4 / 32. Plugging in the given numbers (T = 1×10^6 N·mm, L = 1000 mm, E = 210,000 MPa, ν = 0.3), one can solve for the diameter that keeps the predicted twist angle between about 70% and 90% of the allowable 0.05 rad. A diameter of approximately 42 mm yields a twist angle around 0.04 rad (≈80% of 0.05 rad), which is squarely in the desired scoring “sweet spot.”', config=ConfigFile(Th=42.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'phi': 0.040528170291472015, 'threshold': 0.05}, 'score': 100.0}
