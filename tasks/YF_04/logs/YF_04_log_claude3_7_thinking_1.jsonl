{'completion_tokens': 7649, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I determined the appropriate shaft diameter by analyzing the torsional behavior of the steel shaft under the given loading conditions. Using the torsion formula φ = T·L/(G·J), where φ is the angle of twist, T is the applied torque, L is the length, G is the shear modulus, and J is the polar moment of inertia, I calculated the required diameter. First, I found the shear modulus G = E/(2(1+ν)) = 210,000/(2(1+0.3)) = 80,769.23 MPa. Since the scoring system favors twist angles between 70% and 90% of the allowable threshold (0.05 rad), I aimed for approximately 80% of this value (0.04 rad). Solving for the required polar moment of inertia: J = T·L/(G·φ) = 10⁶·1000/(80,769.23·0.04) = 309,523.24 mm⁴. For a solid circular shaft, J = (π/32)·D⁴, giving D = 42.13 mm. Verifying with D = 42 mm yielded a twist angle of 0.0405 rad, which is 81% of the allowable threshold and well within the optimal scoring range. This diameter provides an excellent balance between structural performance and material efficiency.', config=ConfigFile(Th=42.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'phi': 0.040528170291472015, 'threshold': 0.05}, 'score': 100.0}
