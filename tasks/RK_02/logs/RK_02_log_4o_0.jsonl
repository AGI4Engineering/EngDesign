If the design is symmetric about the x-axis, output 'Symmetric-X'; otherwise, output 'Asymmetric-X'.\n\n4. **Store the Results:**\n   - Store the minimum structural compliance as C_y_hat.\n   - Store the volume fraction as vf.\n   - Store the design feature (symmetry) as Dsg_feature.\n\nBy following these steps, we can obtain the required optimized design and the corresponding outputs.", config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=150.0, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'compliance_error': 'Fail (CE=3224.7391)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Pass'}, 'score': 50}
