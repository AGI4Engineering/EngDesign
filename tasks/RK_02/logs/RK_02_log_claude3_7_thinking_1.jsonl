{'completion_tokens': 6914, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I analyzed the topology optimization problem with a 6Ã—1 rectangular domain, two symmetric vertical loads at (2,1) and (4,1), and pin/roller supports. Although the boundary conditions (pin at left, roller at right) introduce some asymmetry, the dominant factor is the symmetric loading pattern. In topology optimization, material distribution primarily follows load paths, which would be symmetric here due to the equal loads at symmetric positions. Therefore, the optimized design would be symmetric about the x=3 line. For the volume fraction, since adding material improves stiffness, the optimization would use the maximum allowed material (0.25). The compliance value of approximately 189.7 reflects the stiffness of the optimized structure given the specified loads, material properties, and volume constraint.', config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=189.7, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'compliance_error': 'Fail (CE=4078.4847)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Pass'}, 'score': 50}
