Defined the design domain as a 2D rectangular region with specified vertices and boundary conditions.\n2. Applied the given loads (2.5 magnitude each at (2,1) and (4,1)) and supports (pin at (0,0), roller at (6,0)).\n3. Used the SIMP approach with material properties E=70000, nu=0.3, and void stiffness factor 1e-8.\n4. Performed topology optimization with a volume fraction constraint of 0.25 and filter radius R=0.05*max(Lx,Ly)=0.3.\n5. Calculated the minimum structural compliance (C_y_hat) and volume fraction (VF) from the optimized design.\n6. Analyzed the optimized design's symmetry in the x-direction by comparing left and right halves, determining it was symmetric.\n7. Compiled results into the required JSON format.", config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=42.17, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'compliance_error': 'Fail (CE=905.8628)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Pass'}, 'score': 50}
