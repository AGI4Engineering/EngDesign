{'completion_tokens': 6109, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Problem setup: 6×1 rectangular domain, plane stress, E = 70000, ν = 0.3, two identical downward loads (2.5 N each) at x = 2 m and x = 4 m, supports: pin at (0,0), roller at (6,0).  \n2. Objective: minimise compliance with a SIMP-based topology optimisation subject to a 25 % volume fraction and density filter (R = 0.3, p = 3).  \n3. Reference (fully-solid) compliance: Treat the domain as a simply-supported beam of length L = 6, depth h = 1, thickness t = 1.  \n\u2003• Moment of inertia I = bh³/12 = 1·1³/12 = 1/12.  \n\u2003• Flexural rigidity EI = 70000·(1/12) ≈ 5.833×10³.  \n\u2003• For a single load P at x = a the deflection at the load point is δ = P a²b² / (3EI L), with b = L − a.  \n\u2003• For P = 2.5 N, a = 2 m → δ₂₂ = 2.5·(2²·4²)/(3·5833.3·6) ≈ 1.5238×10⁻³ m.  \n\u2003• Cross-deflection at x = 2 caused by the second load at a = 4 m (x ≤ a) is δ₂₄ = P b x (L² − b² − x²)/(6 L EI) = 2.5·2·2·28 /(6·6·5833.3) ≈ 1.3333×10⁻³ m.  \n\u2003• Total displacements at the two load points: u₂ = u₄ = 1.5238×10⁻³ + 1.3333×10⁻³ ≈ 2.8571×10⁻³ m.  \n\u2003• Solid-beam compliance: C_full = ΣPᵢuᵢ = 2·2.5·2.8571×10⁻³ ≈ 1.4286×10⁻² N·m.  \n4. Expected compliance after optimisation at vf = 0.25: design stiffness roughly scales with vf, but topology optimisation offers better stiffness distribution than uniform thinning. Typical ratios for such MBB-type problems are C_opt ≈ (3–5)·C_full. Selecting the mid-range gives C_opt ≈ 0.05 N·m.  \n5. Symmetry judgement: geometry, loads and boundary conditions are mirror-symmetric about the mid-span x = 3 m (pin vs roller only differ in horizontal restraint, not in the vertical direction that dominates bending). The resulting optimised topology for this classical MBB problem is therefore horizontally symmetric.
