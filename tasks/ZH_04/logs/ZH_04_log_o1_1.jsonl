{'completion_tokens': 6447, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A simple way to satisfy the horizontal distance, depth, time, and energy constraints is to choose the glide angle so that 2000 m of horizontal travel corresponds to 400 m of depth. That fixes tan(θ) = 400/2000 = 0.2, giving a glide angle of about 11.3°. At a 1 m/s speed along the path, the round-trip distance is about 4000/cos(θ) ≈ 4080 m, which takes roughly 4080 s (1.13 hours), well under 2 hours. The power required is P(z) = 100 + 0.05·m + 0.2·z, so the total energy is obtained by integrating from z=0 to 400 for the dive plus from 400 to 0 on the ascent. For θ = 11.3°, the total energy consumption becomes E ≈ 2·(1/sinθ)[56000 + 20 m], in Joules, where m is the total vehicle mass in kg. Converting 200 Wh to 720,000 J imposes an upper limit on m. Choosing a mass of 700 kg stays within 200 Wh, while also keeping mass/volume ≤ 1025 kg/m³ so it floats when empty. A volume of 0.7 m³ and a mass of 700 kg yields a density of 1000 kg/m³, adequately below water density. These parameters all meet the mission goals, battery limit, and time constraints.', config=ConfigFile(angle=11.3, volume=0.7, mass=700.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'horizontal_distance_m': 4003.608899118445, 'time_seconds': 4082.7544889572296, 'energy_required_Wh': 198.42186816332145, 'volume_m3': 0.7, 'density_kg_per_m3': 1000.0000000000001, 'passed': True}, 'score': 100}
