Since we need a V-shaped path with 400m depth, the glide angle θ must allow for:\n   - At least 4000m horizontal distance\n   - 800m vertical distance (400m down and 400m up)\n\nThe relationship between glide angle, horizontal distance, and vertical distance is:\n   - tan(θ) = vertical/horizontal\n   - For a single leg (down or up): tan(θ) = 400m/(horizontal distance of one leg)\n   - Total horizontal distance = 2 × (horizontal distance of one leg)\n   - So, horizontal distance of one leg = 2000m (minimum)\n   - Therefore: tan(θ) = 400m/2000m = 0.2\n   - θ = arctan(0.2) ≈ 11.3 degrees\n\nThis is the maximum angle that would meet our horizontal distance requirement. Let's use θ = 10° to ensure we exceed the minimum horizontal distance requirement while maintaining a reasonable glide angle.\n\n2) Let's analyze the energy constraint:\n   - Battery capacity ≤ 200 Wh\n   - Power consumption: P(z) = P₀ + l·m + k·z = 100W + 0.05W/kg·m + 0.2W/m·z\n\nFor a V-shaped path, we need to calculate the total energy consumption. With a constant speed of 1 m/s and a glide angle of 10°, we can calculate the time spent at each depth.\n\nThe vertical rate of change is: 1 m/s × sin(10°) ≈ 0.174 m/s\nSo it takes 400m ÷ 0.174 m/s ≈ 2299 seconds to go down 400m, and the same to come up.\n\nThe total travel time would be 2 × 2299 ≈ 4598 seconds (about 1.28 hours), which is within our 2-hour limit.\n\nTo calculate energy, I need to integrate the power consumption over the entire path. Since power increases linearly with depth, I can use the average depth for a simple approximation: (0m + 400m)/2 = 200m average depth.\n\nAverage power = 100W + 0.05W/kg·m + 0.2W/m·200m = 100W + 0.05W/kg·m + 40W = 140W + 0.05W/kg·m\n\nTotal energy ≈ Average power × Total time = (140W + 0.05W/kg·m) × 4598s\n\n3) The vehicle must float without water inside it, meaning its density must be less than water:\n   - Vehicle density = m/V < 1025 kg/m³ (water density)\n\nLet's choose a vehicle volume V = 0.5 m³, which is within our 0.2-1 m³ range.\n\nFor the vehicle to float, its mass m must satisfy: m/V < 1025 kg/m³\nSo m < 1025 × 0.5 = 512.5 kg\n\nSince the vehicle mass should be at least 200 kg, I'll choose m = 500 kg, which provides buoyancy while still being close to the maximum allowable.\n\nWith these parameters:\n- θ = 10 degrees\n- V = 0.5 m³\n- m = 500 kg\n\nThe total energy consumption would be:\n(140W + 0.05W/kg·500kg) × 4598s = (140W + 25W) × 4598s = 165W × 4598s = 758.67 Wh\n\nThis exceeds our battery capacity of 200 Wh. I need to adjust my parameters.\n\nLet's try with a smaller mass and revise the calculations:\n- θ = 10 degrees\n- V = 0.5 m³\n- m = 250 kg\n\nAverage power = 100W + 0.05W/kg·250kg + 40W = 100W + 12.5W + 40W = 152.5W\nTotal energy = 152.5W × 4598s = 701.18 Wh\n\nThis is still too high. Let's reconsider our approach.\n\nThe power consumption is dominated by the base power P₀ = 100W, and we've already chosen a shallow glide angle to minimize time. Let's try a steeper angle to reduce travel time:\n\n- θ = 15 degrees\n- Vertical rate = 1 m/s × sin(15°) ≈ 0.259 m/s\n- Time to depth = 400m ÷ 0.259 m/s ≈ 1544 seconds (down and same up)\n- Total time = 2 × 1544 = 3088 seconds (about 0.86 hours)\n\nHorizontal distance = 2 × 400m/tan(15°) ≈ 2988m (which is less than our 4000m requirement)\n\nLet's try a more moderate angle:\n- θ = 12 degrees\n- Vertical rate = 1 m/s × sin(12°) ≈ 0.208 m/s\n- Time to depth = 400m ÷ 0.208 m/s ≈ 1923 seconds\n- Total time = 2 × 1923 = 3846 seconds\n- Horizontal distance = 2 × 400m/tan(12°) ≈ 3788m\n\nThis doesn't quite meet our horizontal distance requirement. Given these constraints, we need to make a compromise. Let's settle on:\n- θ = 11 degrees\n- V = 0.5 m³\n- m = 200 kg (minimum required)\n\nWith these parameters:\n- Vertical rate = 1 m/s × sin(11°) ≈ 0.191 m/s\n- Time to depth = 400m ÷ 0.191 m/s ≈ 2094 seconds\n- Total time = 2 × 2094 = 4188 seconds (about 1.16 hours)\n- Horizontal distance = 2 × 400m/tan(11°) ≈ 4092m (meets our requirement)\n\nAverage power = 100W + 0.05W/kg·200kg + 40W = 100W + 10W + 40W = 150W\nTotal energy = 150W × 4188s = 628,200 Ws = 174.5 Wh\n\nThis meets our battery capacity constraint of 200 Wh and all other constraints.\n\nThus, our final design parameters are:\n- Glide angle θ = 11 degrees\n- Vehicle volume V = 0.5 m³\n- Vehicle mass m = 200 kg", config=ConfigFile(angle=11.0, volume=0.5, mass=200.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'horizontal_distance_m': 4115.643212776248, 'time_seconds': 4192.674451334279, 'energy_required_Wh': 174.6481835339134, 'volume_m3': 0.5, 'density_kg_per_m3': 400.0, 'passed': True}, 'score': 100}
