# Evaluation Pipeline for Tetris Block ROM Analysis

1. Parse the LLM response to extract the structured output
2. Validate the extracted tetromino pattern against the ground truth ROM data
   - Compare bit patterns directly with the ROM content at the calculated address
   - Verify that the visual representation matches the bit pattern
3. Calculate scores based on the simplified rubric:
   - Use code-based verification for pattern extraction
   - Allocate 100 points for correct pattern extraction
4. Generate a simplified evaluation report with scores and explanations

The evaluation will primarily use code-based verification against the ground truth ROM data, ensuring objective assessment of pattern extraction. The focus is exclusively on the correctness of the extracted pattern compared to the ROM data.
