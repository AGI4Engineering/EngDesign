{"completion_tokens": 1038, "response": "reasoning='To meet the performance specifications, the following steps were taken:\\n1. **DC differential-mode gain (AV0 \u2265 40 dB)**: This requires sufficient transconductance (gm) and output resistance (ro). The differential pair (N5, N4) and current mirror (P1, P0) were sized to ensure high gm and ro.\\n2. **Unity-gain frequency (fUGF \u2265 50 MHz)**: This is primarily determined by the gm of the input transistors (N5, N4) and the load capacitance (CL = 2 pF). The widths of N5 and N4 were increased to boost gm.\\n3. **Common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR \u2265 80 dB)**: This requires good matching in the differential pair and current mirror. The lengths of N5, N4, P1, and P0 were kept equal to ensure matching.\\n4. **Input common-mode range (ICMR \u2265 800 mV)**: This is ensured by proper biasing and sizing of the input transistors (N5, N4) and the current mirror (P1, P0).\\n\\nThe final sizes were chosen as follows:\\n- N5 and N4: W = 10u, L = 0.5u, M = 1 (to ensure high gm for fUGF)\\n- P1 and P0: W = 5u, L = 0.5u, M = 1 (to ensure matching and sufficient ro for AV0)\\n- N3 and N2: W and L were kept as given to maintain the bias current.' config=ConfigFile(netlist='// Library name: MP3\\n// Cell name: ota\\n// View name: schematic\\nsubckt ota VDD VSS ibp10u vin vip vout\\n    N3 (ibp10u ibp10u VSS VSS) tsmc18dN w=30.015u l=3.015u as=1.35068e-11 \\\\\\n        ad=1.35068e-11 ps=60.93u pd=60.93u m=1 region=sat\\n    N2 (net7 ibp10u VSS VSS) tsmc18dN w=480.015u l=3.015u as=2.16007e-10 \\\\\\n        ad=2.16007e-10 ps=960.93u pd=960.93u m=1 region=sat\\n    N5 (vout vin net7 net7) tsmc18dN w=10u l=0.5u as=10u * 2.5 * (180.0n) ad=10u * 2.5 * (180.0n) \\\\\\n         ps=(2 * 10u) + (5 * (180.0n)) pd=(2 * 10u) + (5 * (180.0n)) m=1 \\\\\\n        region=sat\\n    N4 (net8 vip net7 net7) tsmc18dN w=10u l=0.5u as=10u * 2.5 * (180.0n) ad=10u * 2.5 * (180.0n) \\\\\\n         ps=(2 * 10u) + (5 * (180.0n)) pd=(2 * 10u) + (5 * (180.0n)) m=1 \\\\\\n        region=sat\\n    P1 (net8 net8 VDD VDD) tsmc18dP w=5u l=0.5u as=5u * 2.5 * (180.0n) ad=5u * 2.5 * (180.0n) \\\\\\n         ps=(2 * 5u) + (5 * (180.0n)) pd=(2 * 5u) + (5 * (180.0n)) m=1 \\\\\\n        region=sat\\n    P0 (vout net8 VDD VDD) tsmc18dP w=5u l=0.5u as=5u * 2.5 * (180.0n) ad=5u * 2.5 * (180.0n) \\\\\\n         ps=(2 * 5u) + (5 * (180.0n)) pd=(2 * 5u) + (5 * (180.0n)) m=1 \\\\\\n        region=sat\\nends ota\\n// Library name: MP3\\n// Cell name: dut\\n// View name: schematic\\nI16 (net1 net2 net6 net4 net3 net5) ota')", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"metrics": {"dc_gain_db": 36.383, "ugf_mhz": 66.046, "cmrr_db": 65.765, "icmr_v": 0.3}, "sub_scores": {"dc_gain": 0, "ugf": 20, "cmrr": 0, "icmr": 0, "netlist": 0}, "score": 20, "passed": false}, "score": 20}
