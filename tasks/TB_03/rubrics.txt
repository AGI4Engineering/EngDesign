## Evaluation Rubric (100 points total)

General Policy
--------------
1. A submission must be syntactically valid and simulate without error; otherwise it receives 0.
2. For each specification below, credit is given for the **highest satisfied tier only** (no double-counting).
3. If the lower tier is not met, the score for that item is 0.
4. All measurements are taken with the official testbench (VDD = 1.4 V, CL = 2 pF, VCM = 600 mV), unless otherwise specified.
