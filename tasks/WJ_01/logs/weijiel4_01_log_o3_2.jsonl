{'completion_tokens': 1384, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Noise analysis: The image shows a dense sprinkling of randomly–coloured single-pixel dots. Those dots have either the minimum or maximum possible value in at least one colour channel and occur sparsely relative to their 3×3 neighbourhood – the hallmark of impulse (salt-and-pepper) noise.  In addition, a slight overall grain indicates mild Gaussian noise, but the corruption is dominated by impulse noise.\n\n2. Filtering strategy – keep it as simple as possible while still addressing both components:\n   • First remove the high-energy impulse pixels with a median filter (median is explicitly designed for salt-and-pepper).  A 5×5 window is large enough to wipe out isolated impulses while still maintaining edges.\n   • The median step leaves a faint Gaussian-like residual noise and some colour blotches.  An edge-preserving, patch-based Non–Local Means (cv2.fastNlMeansDenoisingColored) is applied next; it averages similar patches across the image, which efficiently attenuates low-level Gaussian noise without blurring edges.\n   • Finally a light bilateral filter gives one more pass of edge-preserving smoothing to polish colour speckles that may remain after NLM.\n\n3. Chosen parameters (empirically robust for 512×512 images):\n   • median: ksize = 5\n   • fastNlMeansDenoisingColored: h = 10, hColor = 10, templateWindowSize = 7, searchWindowSize = 21\n   • bilateral: d = 9, sigmaColor = 75, sigmaSpace = 75\n\nThis three–step pipeline is fast, available in standard OpenCV, and generally recovers most of Lena’s details while achieving low MSE / high PSNR.', config=ConfigFile(denoising_strategy='Dominant impulse (salt-and-pepper) noise plus a smaller Gaussian component.
