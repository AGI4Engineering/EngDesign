{'completion_tokens': 2371, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Noise analysis: The image shows a very large amount of coloured, high-contrast speckles – bright and dark pixels scattered almost randomly.  Typical symptoms: \n   • Isolated extreme values (impulsive → salt-and-pepper type) that totally replace the underlying signal.\n   • In between the speckles, a weak fine-grain component is also visible (low-variance Gaussian–like).\n\n   So we are facing a MIXTURE of (a) high–density salt–and-pepper / impulse noise and (b) moderate coloured Gaussian noise.\n\n2. Filter strategy and order\n   • Step-1  Median(3×3) – quick, edge-preserving removal of single-pixel impulses.\n   • Step-2  Median(5×5) – a second, slightly larger median eliminates residual 2-pixel speckles while still keeping edges recognisable.\n   • Step-3  fastNlMeansDenoisingColored – a non-local means implementation that excels at coloured, approximately Gaussian noise while preserving both texture and edges far better than a plain Gaussian blur.\n   • Step-4  Un-sharp mask (GaussianBlur→addWeighted) – optional, very light sharpening (amount 0.5, sigma 1.5) to compensate for softness introduced by the previous steps without re-amplifying noise.\n\n   This three-stage cascade specifically targets the two different noise sources and finally restores lost crispness.\n\n3. Parameters\n   • median ksize1 = 3 (must be odd)\n   • median ksize2 = 5\n   • fastNlMeans: h = 10, hColor = 10, templateWindow = 7, searchWindow = 21  (good generic settings, still conservative)\n   • unsharp-mask: Gaussian σ = 1.5 (kernel size (0,0) lets OpenCV derive it from σ), amount = 0.5 (implemented with addWeighted: dst = 1.5*img − 0.5*blur)\n\n4.
