Visual inspection of the supplied picture (classic Lena) shows very bright and very dark single-pixel dots of many colours scattered everywhere – a textbook example of salt-and-pepper / impulse noise.  The image also looks slightly grainy in the smooth regions, pointing to a weak Gaussian component.  \n\n2.  Strategy – treat the dominant impulse component first, then gently smooth the remaining Gaussian noise while preserving edges:\n   • Step-1  Median filter (ksize 5): removes most of the high-intensity single-pixel outliers without blurring edges too much.\n   • Step-2  fastNlMeansDenoisingColored: a non-local means implementation in OpenCV that is very effective for low-frequency Gaussian-like residual noise while respecting colour edges.  Using moderate strength avoids over-smoothing details already cleaned by the median filter.\n\nThe two-stage pipeline is simple yet sufficient; more stages would risk detail loss.\n\n3.  Chosen parameters\n   • medianBlur  ksize = 5  (odd integer > 1)\n   • fastNlMeansDenoisingColored  h = 12, hColor = 10, templateWindowSize = 7, searchWindowSize = 21  (close to OpenCV defaults, slightly stronger h)\n\n4.
