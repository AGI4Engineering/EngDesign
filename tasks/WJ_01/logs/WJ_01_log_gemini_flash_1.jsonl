Salt-and-pepper noise is characterized by random black and white pixels, while Gaussian noise is a more subtle, continuous variation in pixel values. To address this mixture of noise, a combination of filters is required.\\n\\nFirst, a median filter is applied to remove salt-and-pepper noise. The median filter replaces each pixel with the median value of its neighbors, effectively eliminating isolated noise pixels while preserving edges. A small kernel size (3x3) is chosen to avoid excessive blurring.\\n\\nSecond, a Gaussian blur is applied to reduce Gaussian noise and smooth the image. The Gaussian blur uses a Gaussian kernel to average pixel values, reducing the impact of random variations. The kernel size and sigma value are chosen to balance noise reduction and detail preservation.\\n\\nFinally, a bilateral filter is applied to further reduce noise while preserving edges. The bilateral filter is a non-linear filter that averages pixel values based on both their spatial distance and their intensity difference. This allows it to smooth noise while avoiding blurring edges, resulting in a more visually pleasing denoised image.\\n\\nThe code applies these filters sequentially using OpenCV functions.' config=ConfigFile(denoising_strategy='A combination of median filtering to remove salt-and-pepper noise, followed by Gaussian blurring to reduce Gaussian noise, and finally bilateral filtering to further reduce noise while preserving edges.', filter_sequence=['median(ksize=3)', 'gaussian(ksize=5, sigmaX=1.0)', 'bilateralFilter(d=5, sigmaColor=30, sigmaSpace=30)'], function_code='import cv2\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\ndef denoise_image(noisy_img):\\n    \"\"\"Denoises an image using a sequence of filters.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        noisy_img (np.ndarray): The noisy input image.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n        np.ndarray: The denoised image.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n    # Apply median filter to remove salt-and-pepper noise\\n    img_median = cv2.medianBlur(noisy_img, 3)\\n\\n    # Apply Gaussian blur to reduce Gaussian noise\\n    img_gaussian = cv2.GaussianBlur(img_median, (5, 5), 1.0)\\n\\n    # Apply bilateral filter to preserve edges and further reduce noise\\n    filtered_img = cv2.bilateralFilter(img_gaussian, d=5, sigmaColor=30, sigmaSpace=30)\\n\\n    return filtered_img')", "passed": true, "evaluation_result": {"strategy": "A combination of median filtering to remove salt-and-pepper noise, followed by Gaussian blurring to reduce Gaussian noise, and finally bilateral filtering to further reduce noise while preserving edges.", "score": {"mse": 55.09990946451823, "psnr": 30.7192947561127}, "denoising function": "import cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef denoise_image(noisy_img):\n    \"\"\"Denoises an image using a sequence of filters.\n\n    Args:\n        noisy_img (np.ndarray): The noisy input image.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: The denoised image.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Apply median filter to remove salt-and-pepper noise\n    img_median = cv2.medianBlur(noisy_img, 3)\n\n    # Apply Gaussian blur to reduce Gaussian noise\n    img_gaussian = cv2.GaussianBlur(img_median, (5, 5), 1.0)\n\n    # Apply bilateral filter to preserve edges and further reduce noise\n    filtered_img = cv2.bilateralFilter(img_gaussian, d=5, sigmaColor=30, sigmaSpace=30)\n\n    return filtered_img"}, "score": 75.0390265297252}
