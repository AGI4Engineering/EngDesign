{'completion_tokens': 1417, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Step 1: Noise Analysis\nLooking at the noisy Lena image, we observe two distinct types of artifacts: bright/dark speckles scattered across the image (salt-and-pepper or impulse noise) and a grainy, random variation that affects large regions (Gaussian-like speckle noise). This is a mixture of impulse and Gaussian noise.\n\nStep 2: Filtering Strategy\n1. Remove impulse noise (salt-and-pepper) with a median filter, which replaces each pixel with the median of its neighborhood, effectively eliminating isolated bright/dark spikes without blurring edges.\n2. Perform an edge-preserving smoothing using a bilateral filter to reduce Gaussian noise while keeping strong edges intact.\n3. Apply Non-Local Means (fastNlMeansDenoisingColored) to further denoise residual graininess by averaging similar patches across the image, yielding fine texture preservation.\n\nStep 3: Filter Sequence and Parameters\n- median(ksize=3): small window to remove impulse noise.\n- bilateral(d=9, sigmaColor=75, sigmaSpace=75): moderate spatial radius and color range to smooth noise but preserve edges.\n- nl_means(h=10, templateWindowSize=7, searchWindowSize=21): patch-based denoising with moderate filtering strength.\n\nStep 4: Code Implementation\nWe implement a single function `denoise_image` that applies these three filters in sequence and returns the denoised color image.', config=ConfigFile(denoising_strategy='Mixture of salt-and-pepper (impulse) noise and Gaussian-like speckle noise.
