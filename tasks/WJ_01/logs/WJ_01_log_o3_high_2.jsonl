{'completion_tokens': 1742, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Step-by-step analysis and solution design:\n\n1. Noise inspection\n   • The noisy Lena image shows many isolated single-pixel colour dots that are much brighter or darker than their neighbourhood.  \n   • The dots are not only black/white but any RGB combination (e.g. green, magenta, yellow), which is what happens when each colour channel is independently flipped to 0 or 255.  \n   • This is the typical signature of impulse (salt-and-pepper) noise on a colour image.  \n   • Apart from these impulses, the underlying image looks slightly grainy, i.e. there is a weak Gaussian component left after removing the impulses.\n\n2. Matching filters to noise\n   • Median filtering is the standard first choice for removing salt-and-pepper noise because it replaces every pixel with the median of its neighbourhood, eliminating isolated outliers while keeping edges.  \n   • A single median pass with a very large kernel would over-blur details, so we use two passes: first a small 3×3 kernel to erase tiny impulses, then a 5×5 kernel to remove any that remain, still preserving most details.  \n   • After impulses are suppressed, a refinement step aimed at the residual weak Gaussian colour noise can further increase PSNR.  OpenCV’s fast non-local means (fastNlMeansDenoisingColored) is well suited: it averages self-similar patches, keeps edges and colours, and noticeably boosts SNR.\n\n3. Filter pipeline (and parameter choice)\n   1) median(ksize=3)                     – remove 1-pixel impulses\n   2) median(ksize=5)                     – clean remaining larger impulses\n   3) fastNlMeansDenoisingColored(        – polish result, reduce residual Gaussian noise\n        h=10, hColor=10,\n        templateWindowSize=7,\n        searchWindowSize=21 )\n   Parameters (empirically safe defaults for 512×512 8-bit images):\n   • h/hColor 10 → moderate smoothing with good detail retention.\n   • templateWindow 7, searchWindow 21 are OpenCV’s recommended values.\n\n4.
