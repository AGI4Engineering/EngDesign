{'completion_tokens': 6889, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="Analyzing the image reveals severe colored noise throughout. The noise has characteristics of high-variance Gaussian noise with uniform distribution across all color channels. The noise pattern shows random color variations typical of additive Gaussian noise in RGB channels. To address this, I've designed a three-stage filtering approach: (1) Non-local means denoising with moderately high strength parameters to target the Gaussian noise component while preserving underlying details - this algorithm is particularly effective at removing Gaussian noise while maintaining image structure; (2) Bilateral filtering to preserve important edges while further smoothing areas of similar color - this helps maintain structural details like facial features and the hat's contours; (3) A small-kernel median filter as the final stage to address any remaining impulse noise components without over-smoothing the image. The parameter values were carefully selected to balance noise removal against detail preservation, with the non-local means strength high enough to handle the severe noise but not so high that it creates an artificial appearance.", config=ConfigFile(denoising_strategy="The image is corrupted with high-variance colored Gaussian noise across all channels.
