A median filter is effective at removing this type of noise while preserving edges. However, upon close inspection, I can observe there is some Gaussian-like noise in the image. Therefore, I will use a Gaussian filter to reduce Gaussian noise. After the Gaussian filter is applied, the image still has visible salt and pepper noise and the performance of median filter may be undermined by the Gaussian noise. Therefore, it is better to apply the median filter first.
