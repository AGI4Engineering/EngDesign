{'completion_tokens': 12076, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1) Task 1 uses the standard radar‐range equation for a matched filter with a rectangular pulse. Substituting Pt=200 kW, G=34 dB, tau=11 μs, λ=0.1 m (3 GHz), F=4.1 dB, and R=100 km, we obtain about 18.32 dB of SNR available. 2) For a steady (nonfluctuating) target with Pd=0.9, Pfa=1e−6, standard detection tables indicate about 13.20 dB. 3) Under Swerling‐1 fluctuations, that grows to about 16.00 dB. 4) With 10‐pulse noncoherent integration on a Swerling‐1 target, the required SNR drops to around 7.00 dB. 5) The integration gain from single‐pulse (steady target) to 10‐pulse (steady) is about 10.00 dB. 6) The fluctuation loss (difference between 10‐pulse Swerling‐1 and 10‐pulse steady) is about 3.80 dB. 7) Using 7.00 dB as the required SNR, and noting that the single‐pulse SNR at 100 km is around 18.32 dB, with about 9 dB of additional gain for 10 pulses (Swerling‐1), yields a large margin, implying roughly 319.70 km is the maximum detection range. 8) The minimum range for a full echo with an 11 μs pulse is c·τ/2=1.65 km. 9) With PRF=1350 Hz, the unambiguous range is c/(2·PRF)=111.11 km. 10) The approximate scan sector loss for ±60° is about 3.0000 dB. 11) With a 2‐pulse MTI canceller, typical MTI noise correlation and velocity response losses are about 1.3000 dB and 2.4000 dB, respectively. 12) A 10‐of‐6 binary integrator has about 1.0000 dB suboptimal integration loss. 13) Cell‐averaging CFAR with 120 reference cells for Pfa=1e−6 yields about 1.2000 dB loss. 14) Starting from the single‐pulse steady requirement of 13.20 dB, subtract the 10 dB integration gain, then add the 3.80 dB fluctuation loss, 1.2338 dB beam‐shape loss, 3.0000 dB scan‐sector loss, 1.3000 dB + 2.4000 dB MTI losses, 1.0000 dB binary‐integration loss, and 1.2000 dB CFAR loss, we get about 17.13 dB as the effective detectability factor. 15) Since the radar provides about 18.32 dB available SNR at 100 km and we need 17.13 dB, the system can meet the requirement, so the feasibility flag is 1.', config=ConfigFile(SNRatRm=18.32, tor1=0.5, D0=13.2, tor2=0.2, D1=16.0, tor3=0.2, DN=7.0, tor4=0.2, Gi=10.0, tor5=0.2, Lf=3.8, tor6=0.2, actual_Rm=319.7, tor7=5.0, Rmin=1.65, tor8=0.05, Rua=111.11, tor9=0.1, scan_sector_loss=3.0, tor10=0.1, Lmti_a=1.3, tor11_a=0.05, Lmti_b=2.4, tor11_b=0.05, binary_integration_loss=1.0, tor12=0.05, cfar_loss=1.2, tor13=0.05, effective_df=17.13, tor14=0.2, evaluate_system_feasibility=1)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'detailed information': 'The available SNR calculated in Task 1 is correct.\nThe required SNR for a single pulse received from a steady target calculated in Task 2 is correct.\nThe required SNR for a single pulse received from a fluctuating target calculated in Task 3 is wrong.\nThe required SNR for 10 noncoherently integrated pulses received from a fluctuating target calculated in Task 4 is wrong.\nThe integration gain calculated in Task 5 is wrong.\nThe fluctuation loss calculated in Task 6 is wrong.\nThe actual maximum range of the system calculated in Task 7 is wrong.\nThe closest range from which a full pulse can be received calculated in Task 8 is correct.\nThe unambiguous range of the system calculated in Task 9 is correct.\nThe scan sector loss calculated in Task 10 is wrong.\nThe MTI noise correlation loss calculated in Task 11 is wrong.\nThe MTI velocity response loss calculated in Task 11 is wrong.\nThe binary integration loss calculated in Task 12 is wrong.\nThe CFAR loss calculated in Task 13 is wrong.\nThe effective detectability factor gained from Task 14 is wrong.\nThe evaluation of whether or not this radar system can satisfy the performance requirement is wrong.\n', 'total_score': 20}, 'score': 20}
