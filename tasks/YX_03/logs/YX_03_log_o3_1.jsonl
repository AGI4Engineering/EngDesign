Using Pt=2×10⁵ W,  G=10^(34/10)=2.5119×10³,  λ=0.1 m,  σ=1 m²,  τ=11 µs,  k=1.38×10⁻²³,  T0=290 K,  F=10^(4.1/10)=2.57, L=1,  R=1×10⁵ m we obtain SNR=68.0 (18.33 dB).\n\nTaREMOVED2  For a square-law detector (single exponential noise sample):  η = –ln Pfa = 13.8155.  Pd = exp(–η/(1+S)).  Solving 0.9 = exp(–η/(1+S)) gives S=130.15 → 21.15 dB.\n\nTaREMOVED3  Swerling-1, single pulse.  Using published detection curves / Shnidman approximation for Pd = 0.9, Pfa = 10⁻⁶ gives D1 ≈ 24.60 dB.\n\nTaREMOVED4  Ten non-coherently integrated pulses, Swerling-1.  Using Poisson-gamma formulation (threshold η≈32 for Pfa) and Shnidman approximation yields required per-pulse SNR DN ≈ 14.20 dB.\n\nTaREMOVED5  Steady target integration gain:  ideal non-coherent gain ≃10 log₁₀N = 10 dB (21.15 – 11.15 = 10 dB).\n\nTaREMOVED6  Fluctuation loss:  Lf = DN – D0(10-pulse steady) = 14.20 – 11.15 = 3.05 dB.\n\nTaREMOVED7  Available SNR ∝ R⁻⁴.  Required SNR (per pulse) = 14.2 dB (26.3 lin).
