From radar detection curves, this is approximately 19.5 dB.\n\n### Task 4: Required SNR for 10 noncoherently integrated pulses from Swerling 1 target\nFor a Swerling 1 target with noncoherent integration of 10 pulses (Pd = 0.9, Pfa = 10^-6), the required SNR per pulse is reduced to approximately 9.5 dB based on standard radar detection curves.\n\n### Task 5: Integration gain for 10 pulses\nThe integration gain is the difference between the SNR required for a single pulse and for N pulses, both for a steady target.\n\nSNR required for single pulse (from Task 2): 13.2 dB\nSNR required for 10 pulses (steady target): 5.5 dB (from radar detection curves)\n\nIntegration gain = 13.2 - 5.5 = 7.7 dB\n\n### Task 6: Fluctuation loss for 10 pulses\nThe fluctuation loss is the difference between the SNR required for a fluctuating target and a steady target, both using the same number of pulses.\n\nSNR required for 10 pulses, Swerling 1 target (from Task 4): 9.5 dB\nSNR required for 10 pulses, steady target: 5.5 dB\n\nFluctuation loss = 9.5 - 5.5 = 4.0 dB\n\n### Task 7: Actual maximum range calculation\nUsing the required SNR from Task 4 (9.5 dB) and available SNR from Task 1 (18.30 dB):\n\nExcess SNR = 18.30 - 9.5 = 8.8 dB = 10^(8.8/10) = 7.59 times\n\nSince SNR scales as 1/R^4, the range can be increased by a factor of 7.59^(1/4) = 1.71\nGiven original range = 100 km, actual maximum range = 100 × 1.71 = 171.00 km\n\n### Task 8: Minimum range calculation (Rmin)\nThe closest range from which a full pulse can be received is determined by the pulse duration:\nRmin = (c×τ)/2 = (3×10^8 × 11×10^-6)/2 = 1.65 km\n\n### Task 9: Unambiguous range calculation\nThe unambiguous range is related to the pulse repetition frequency (PRF):\nRua = c/(2×PRF) = 3×10^8/(2×1350) = 111.11 km\n\n### Task 10: Scan sector loss calculation\nFor a phased array scanning from -60° to 60° (120° total), I need to calculate the scan loss.\n\nFirst, estimate the beamwidth using the antenna gain:\nBeamwidth θ ≈ 70λ/D, where D can be derived from G = 4π×A/λ²\nWith G = 2511.89 and λ = 0.1 m, the beamwidth is approximately 2.47°\n\nScan sector loss = 10log₁₀(scan span/θ) = 10log₁₀(120/2.47) = 16.8699 dB\n\n### Task 11: MTI losses calculation\nFor a 2-pulse canceller:\nMTI noise correlation loss (Lmti_a) = 10log₁₀(3/2) = 1.7609 dB\nMTI velocity response loss (Lmti_b) = 10log₁₀(4/3) = 1.2494 dB\n\n### Task 12: Binary integration loss calculation\nFor binary integration with N = 10 pulses and M = 6 threshold crossings, the binary integration loss compared to optimal noncoherent integration is approximately 0.6931 dB.\n\n### Task 13: CFAR loss calculation\nFor cell-averaging CFAR with 120 reference cells and Pfa = 10^-6, the CFAR loss is approximately 0.8000 dB.\n\n### Task 14: Effective detectability factor calculation\nStarting with the baseline required SNR for a steady target (Task 2): 13.2 dB\nAdjusting with:\n- Integration gain (Task 5): -7.7 dB (gain, so subtracted)\n- Fluctuation loss (Task 6): +4.0 dB\n- Beam shape loss: +1.2338 dB\n- Scan sector loss (Task 10): +16.8699 dB\n- MTI noise correlation loss (Task 11): +1.7609 dB\n- MTI velocity response loss (Task 11): +1.2494 dB\n- Binary integration loss (Task 12): +0.6931 dB\n- CFAR loss (Task 13): +0.8000 dB\n\nEffective detectability factor = 13.2 - 7.7 + 4.0 + 1.2338 + 16.8699 + 1.7609 + 1.2494 + 0.6931 + 0.8000 = 32.12 dB\n\n### Task 15: System feasibility evaluation\nAvailable SNR at 100 km (Task 1): 18.30 dB\nRequired SNR (effective detectability factor from Task 14): 32.12 dB\n\nSince 18.30 dB < 32.12 dB, the system does not meet the requirement for detecting a 1 m² RCS target at 100 km with Pd = 0.9 and Pfa = 10^-6.", config=ConfigFile(SNRatRm=18.3, tor1=0.05, D0=13.2, tor2=0.1, D1=19.5, tor3=0.1, DN=9.5, tor4=0.2, Gi=7.7, tor5=0.2, Lf=4.0, tor6=0.2, actual_Rm=171.0, tor7=2.0, Rmin=1.65, tor8=0.01, Rua=111.11, tor9=0.01, scan_sector_loss=16.8699, tor10=0.5, Lmti_a=1.7609, tor11_a=0.2, Lmti_b=1.2494, tor11_b=0.2, binary_integration_loss=0.6931, tor12=0.2, cfar_loss=0.8, tor13=0.2, effective_df=32.12, tor14=0.3, evaluate_system_feasibility=0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'detailed information': 'The available SNR calculated in Task 1 is correct.\nThe required SNR for a single pulse received from a steady target calculated in Task 2 is correct.\nThe required SNR for a single pulse received from a fluctuating target calculated in Task 3 is wrong.\nThe required SNR for 10 noncoherently integrated pulses received from a fluctuating target calculated in Task 4 is wrong.\nThe integration gain calculated in Task 5 is correct.\nThe fluctuation loss calculated in Task 6 is wrong.\nThe actual maximum range of the system calculated in Task 7 is wrong.\nThe closest range from which a full pulse can be received calculated in Task 8 is correct.\nThe unambiguous range of the system calculated in Task 9 is wrong.\nThe scan sector loss calculated in Task 10 is wrong.\nThe MTI noise correlation loss calculated in Task 11 is wrong.\nThe MTI velocity response loss calculated in Task 11 is wrong.\nThe binary integration loss calculated in Task 12 is wrong.\nThe CFAR loss calculated in Task 13 is wrong.\nThe effective detectability factor gained from Task 14 is wrong.\nThe evaluation of whether or not this radar system can satisfy the performance requirement is correct.\n', 'total_score': 25}, 'score': 25}
