{'completion_tokens': 2229, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The problem requires calculation of several radar performance parameters across 15 tasks. Each task builds upon previous results or given radar system parameters.\nTask 1: Calculated available SNR using the radar range equation. Parameters: Pt=0.2MW, G=34dB, tau=11us, NF=4.1dB, f=3GHz, RCS=1m^2, R=100km, L=0dB. Lambda = c/f = 3e8 / 3e9 = 0.1m. Bandwidth B = 1/tau = 90909.09 Hz. Pt_dBW = 53.0103 dBW. G_lin = 2511.89. Lambda_sq_dB = -20 dB. Sigma_dB = 0 dB. (4pi)^3_dB = 32.976 dB. R^4_dB (for R=100km) = 200 dB. kT0_dBW_Hz = -203.975 dBW/Hz. B_dBHz = 49.586 dBHz. NoiseFloor_dBW = kT0_dBW_Hz + B_dBHz = -154.389 dBW. TotalNoise_dBW = NoiseFloor_dBW + NF_dB = -154.389 + 4.1 = -150.289 dBW. Pr_dBW = Pt_dBW + 2*G_dB + 20log10(lambda) + 10log10(sigma) - 30log10(4pi) - 40log10(R) - L_dB = 53.0103 + 68 - 20 + 0 - 32.9763 - 200 - 0 = -131.966 dBW. SNR_dB = Pr_dBW - TotalNoise_dBW = -131.966 - (-150.289) = 18.323 dB.\nTask 2: Required SNR (D0) for steady target, Pd=0.9, Pfa=1e-6, N=1. Used value from Mahafza Table 2.2: 13.15 dB.\nTask 3: Required SNR (D1) for Swerling 1, Pd=0.9, Pfa=1e-6, N=1. Formula SNR_avg = (ln(Pfa)/ln(Pd)) - 1 = (-13.8155 / -0.10536) - 1 = 130.1266 (linear) = 21.143 dB. Mahafza Table 2.4 gives 21.2 dB. Used 21.14 dB.\nTask 4: Required SNR (DN) for Swerling 1, N=10, Pd=0.9, Pfa=1e-6. Used Mahafza Table 2.4: 9.70 dB.\nTask 5: Integration Gain (Gi). Gi = D0(1) - D0(N=10). D0(1)=13.15 dB. D0(N=10) from Mahafza Table 2.2 is 6.0 dB. Gi = 13.15 - 6.0 = 7.15 dB.\nTask 6: Fluctuation Loss (Lf). Lf = D1(N=10) - D0(N=10). D1(N=10) is DN from Task 4 = 9.70 dB. D0(N=10)=6.0 dB. Lf = 9.70 - 6.0 = 3.70 dB.\nTask 7: Actual max range. SNR_req = DN = 9.70 dB. From Task 1, SNR_avail_at_100km = 18.323 dB. SNR_dB = K_dB - 40log10(R_km). K_dB = 18.323 + 40log10(100) = 18.323 + 80 = 98.323. 9.70 = 98.323 - 40log10(R_actual_km). 40log10(R_actual_km) = 88.623. log10(R_actual_km) = 2.215575. R_actual_km = 10^2.215575 = 164.277 km.\nTask 8: Min range Rmin = c*tau/2 = 3e8 * 11e-6 / 2 = 1650 m = 1.65 km.\nTask 9: Unambiguous range Rua = c/(2*PRF) = 3e8 / (2*1350) = 111111.11 m = 111.11 km.\nTask 10: Scan sector loss. One-way gain G_eff = G_initial * cos(theta_scan_effect) * cos(theta_element_effect). Assuming theta_scan_effect = theta_element_effect = theta_m = 60 deg. G_eff = G_initial * cos^2(60). Loss for G_eff is 10*log10(1/cos^4(60)) for two-way radar equation if G refers to G_Tx and G_Rx. This is 10*log10(1/(0.5)^4) = 10*log10(16) = 12.0412 dB.\nTask 11: MTI losses for 2-pulse canceller. Lmti_a (noise correlation loss) = 3.0 dB. Lmti_b (velocity response loss) = 2.3 dB (standard values).\nTask 12: Binary integration loss for N=10, M=6, Pd=0.9, Pfa=1e-6. From Nathanson, Fig 4.22, SNR_M_of_N is ~7.3 dB for steady target. SNR_optimal_steady (D0(N=10)) = 6.0 dB. Loss = 7.3 - 6.0 = 1.3 dB.\nTask 13: CFAR loss for CA-CFAR, N_ref=120, Pfa=1e-6. Extrapolated from Gandesha & O'Reilly for Swerling 1 (can be used as estimate): ~0.15 dB.\nTask 14: Effective detectability factor. D_eff = D0(1) - Gi + Lf + L_beamshape + L_scansector + Lmti_a + Lmti_b + L_binary_int + L_cfar. D_eff = 13.15 - 7.15 + 3.70 + 1.2338 + 12.0412 + 3.0000 + 2.3000 + 1.3000 + 0.1500 = 29.725 dB.\nTask 15: System feasibility. SNR_available (Task 1) = 18.32 dB. SNR_required_effective (Task 14) = 29.73 dB. Since 18.32 < 29.73, system is not feasible (0).\nError estimates (tor values) are based on typical precision of calculations, chart/table readings, and propagation of errors.", config=ConfigFile(SNRatRm=18.32, tor1=0.01, D0=13.15, tor2=0.05, D1=21.14, tor3=0.05, DN=9.7, tor4=0.1, Gi=7.15, tor5=0.1, Lf=3.7, tor6=0.15, actual_Rm=164.28, tor7=0.95, Rmin=1.65, tor8=0.01, Rua=111.11, tor9=0.01, scan_sector_loss=12.0412, tor10=0.0001, Lmti_a=3.0, tor11_a=0.05, Lmti_b=2.3, tor11_b=0.05, binary_integration_loss=1.3, tor12=0.05, cfar_loss=0.15, tor13=0.02, effective_df=29.73, tor14=0.21, evaluate_system_feasibility=0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'detailed information': 'The available SNR calculated in Task 1 is correct.\nThe required SNR for a single pulse received from a steady target calculated in Task 2 is correct.\nThe required SNR for a single pulse received from a fluctuating target calculated in Task 3 is correct.\nThe required SNR for 10 noncoherently integrated pulses received from a fluctuating target calculated in Task 4 is wrong.\nThe integration gain calculated in Task 5 is wrong.\nThe fluctuation loss calculated in Task 6 is wrong.\nThe actual maximum range of the system calculated in Task 7 is wrong.\nThe closest range from which a full pulse can be received calculated in Task 8 is correct.\nThe unambiguous range of the system calculated in Task 9 is wrong.\nThe scan sector loss calculated in Task 10 is wrong.\nThe MTI noise correlation loss calculated in Task 11 is wrong.\nThe MTI velocity response loss calculated in Task 11 is wrong.\nThe binary integration loss calculated in Task 12 is wrong.\nThe CFAR loss calculated in Task 13 is wrong.\nThe effective detectability factor gained from Task 14 is wrong.\nThe evaluation of whether or not this radar system can satisfy the performance requirement is correct.\n', 'total_score': 25}, 'score': 25}
