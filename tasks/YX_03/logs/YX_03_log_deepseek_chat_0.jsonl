For Task 1, we used the radar range equation to compute the available SNR at 100 km. For Tasks 2-4, we referred to standard detection theory to find the required SNR for different target models. Tasks 5-6 involved calculating integration gain and fluctuation loss. Task 7 adjusted the maximum range based on the required SNR from Task 4. Tasks 8-9 calculated minimum and unambiguous ranges. Tasks 10-13 computed various losses (scan sector, MTI, binary integration, CFAR).
