We estimate error ≈0.05 dB.\n\nTask 2: Required SNR for a single‐pulse, steady (nonfluctuating) target with Pd=0.9, Pfa=1e-6.  Threshold U=–ln(Pfa)=13.8155, use the Marcum‐Q approximation Q1(√2u,√2U)≈Pd and invert via Gaussian‐tail approximation to get u≈21.3 (13.30 dB).  We assign error ≈0.05 dB.\n\nTask 3: Required SNR per pulse for a Swerling 1 fluctuating target: solve Pd = (u/(1+u))·exp[−U/(1+u)] with U=13.8155, Pd=0.9.  Numerical solution u≈139.5 ⇒21.44 dB, error ≈0.05 dB.\n\nTask 4: Noncoherent integration of N=10 pulses for a Swerling 1 target.  Approximate the sum‐energy threshold for Pfa=1e-6 by Gaussian: T′≈10+4.753√10≈25.03.  Under H1 the sum has mean=10(1+u), σ≈(1+u)√10; invert Pd=0.9 ⇒u≈3.21 ⇒5.08 dB.  We estimate error ≈0.10 dB.\n\nTask 5: Integration gain (steady target) = required SNR single‐pulse (13.30 dB) minus required SNR for 10‐pulse noncoherent, steady‐target (from analogous Gaussian approx we found u≈2.49⇒3.98 dB) ⇒ 13.30−3.98=9.32 dB, error ≈0.05 dB.\n\nTask 6: Fluctuation loss = required SNR for fluctuating (5.08 dB) minus steady (3.98 dB) at N=10 ⇒1.10 dB, error ≈0.05 dB.\n\nTask 7: Actual Rm such that Available SNR(R)/Required SNR=1.  SNR∝1/R⁴ gives R_actual=100 km·(SNR₁₀₀/SNR_req)^(1/4)=100·(10^(18.32/10)/10^(5.08/10))^(0.25)≈214.30 km, error ≈0.30 km.\n\nTask 8: Minimum range Rmin=cτ/2=3e8·11e-6/2=1 650 m=1.65 km, error ≈0.01 km.\n\nTask 9: Unambiguous range Rua=c/(2·PRF)=3e8/(2·1350)=111 111 m=111.11 km, error ≈0.01 km.\n\nTask 10: Scan‐sector loss (worst‐case at ±60°) from two cosθ factors ⇒L_scan=−20 log₁₀(cos 60°)=6.0206 dB.
