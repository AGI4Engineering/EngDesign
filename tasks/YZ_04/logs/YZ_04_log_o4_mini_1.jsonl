{'completion_tokens': 1817, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Determine per-cell current requirement: To support a 100 A continuous charge for 20 minutes while limiting cell temperature rise to ≤ 10 °C, we reduce current per cell by paralleling. Assuming a typical LFP pouch cell of 60 Ah capacity (1 C = 60 A) yields 100 A/numCells_p ≤ 1 C. Solving numCells_p ≥ 100 A/60 A ≈ 1.67 ⇒ choose numCells_p = 2 so each cell sees 50 A (0.83 C).\n2. Series count for vehicle pack voltage: For a target pack voltage of ~400 V and nominal cell voltage ~3.2 V, we need numCells_s = 400 V/3.2 V ≈ 125 cells in series.\n3. Cooling plate channel count (NumChannel): To maintain a maximum temperature gradient ≤ 5 °C across the module and a pressure drop < 20 kPa, we choose 10 parallel channels. This splits the flow and keeps pressure drop manageable.\n4. Coolant flowrate (Flowrate): Assuming 4 kW of heat dissipation and coolant properties (ρ≈1000 kg/m³, c_p≈4180 J/kg·K), a total flow of 0.001 m³/s (1 L/s) yields ΔT_fluid ≈ 4 kW/(1 kg/s·4180 J/kg·K) ≈ 0.96 °C, which combined with conduction yields cell ΔT ≤ 10 °C.\n5. Channel diameter (ChannelDia): A 6 mm hydraulic diameter (0.006 m) per channel gives a flow velocity of ~3.5 m/s in each channel. With L ≈ 0.3 m, this yields Re ≈ 1.3×10⁴, friction factor f≈0.03 and pressure drop Δp ≈ f·(L/D)·ρ·u²/2 ≈ 9.6 kPa < 20 kPa.
