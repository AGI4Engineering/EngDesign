Without specific voltage requirements, I'll use numCells_s = 12 as a standard configuration for an EV module.\n\n### Task 2: Cooling System Design\nRequirements:\n- Maximum temperature rise ≤ 10°C\n- Maximum temperature gradient within module ≤ 5°C\n- Maximum pressure drop < 20kPa\n\nFor the cooling plate design, I need to balance heat removal with pressure drop constraints:\n\n1. Number of Channels (NumChannel):\nWith 3×12=36 cells in the module, I'll design with 18 cooling channels to ensure good thermal contact with all cells (one channel per two cells).\n\n2. Channel Diameter (ChannelDia):\nSmaller channels improve heat transfer but increase pressure drop. I'll select 0.008m (8mm) which is within the specified constraint of < 0.01m while providing sufficient cooling capacity.\n\n3. Flowrate:\nI need to determine a flowrate that removes sufficient heat while maintaining acceptable pressure drop.\nFor water-based coolant, a flowrate of 0.0005 m³/s (0.5 L/s) should provide adequate cooling capacity for the entire module without exceeding the 20kPa pressure drop limit.\n\nThis combination of 18 channels, 8mm diameter, and 0.0005 m³/s flowrate should maintain the temperature rise below 10°C and the gradient below 5°C, while keeping pressure drop under 20kPa.", numCells_p=3.0, numCells_s=12.0, NumChannel=18.0, Flowrate=0.0005, ChannelDia=0.008), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'error': 'cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object'}, 'score': None}
