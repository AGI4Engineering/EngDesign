{'completion_tokens': 2023, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Task 1 – Electrical sizing\n1. The cell HPPC tests were made at a 40 A pulse current. To guarantee that 100 A can be accepted continuously for 20 min we assume that a single cell can safely accept about 35 A continuous (≈ 85 % of the 40 A pulse rating).  \n2. Required module fast-charge current = 100 A. 100 A / 35 A ≈ 2.9, therefore 3 cells placed in parallel will comfortably share the current with ≈ 33 A per cell (< 35 A).  \n\u2003→ numCells_p = 3.\n3. A typical EV pack needs ≈ 350 V nominal. An LFP cell is 3.2 V nominal, so 350 V / 3.2 V ≈ 109.4. Rounding to the next integer gives 110 parallel-strings in series.  \n\u2003→ numCells_s = 110.\n\nTask 2 – Thermal & hydraulic sizing of the cooling plate\n4. Joule heat per cell during fast charge: Q̇_cell = I²R. Internal resistance at 25 °C for a large prismatic LFP cell ≈ 2 mΩ. With 33 A the heat per cell is (33 A)²×0.002 Ω ≈ 2.2 W. 330 cells (110 s × 3 p) generate ≈ 730 W.  \n5. To limit the cell temperature rise to ≤10 °C we remove at least the same 730 W with a 5 °C coolant rise (which also satisfies the ≤5 °C in-module gradient requirement):  \n\u2003ṁ = Q̇ / (c_p ΔT) = 730 W / (4186 J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹ × 5 K) ≈ 0.035 kg s⁻¹.  \n6. Adding 40 % margin for non-idealities gives ṁ ≈ 0.05 kg s⁻¹ (≈ 3 L min⁻¹).\n7. Distributing the flow through 4 identical parallel micro-channels keeps velocity and pressure drop low. With a channel diameter of 5 mm (0.005 m) and 0.0125 kg s⁻¹ per branch, the mean velocity is ≈ 0.64 m s⁻¹, Reynolds ≈ 3 × 10⁴ (turbulent but acceptable). Using Darcy-Weisbach with f ≈ 0.02 and a 1 m channel length gives ΔP ≈ 1.6 kPa per branch, well below the 20 kPa limit even after including manifold losses.\n8. Resulting temperature rise (≤10 °C), module gradient (≈5 °C), and pressure drop (≈5 kPa total) all satisfy the specifications.\n\nChosen design parameters:\n• numCells_p = 3  \n• numCells_s = 110  \n• NumChannel = 4  \n• Flowrate = 0.05 kg s⁻¹  \n• ChannelDia = 0.005 m', numCells_p=3.0, numCells_s=110.0, NumChannel=4.0, Flowrate=0.05, ChannelDia=0.005), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Error': "['BattModuleThermalMgmtLFP/Solver Configuration']: At time 721.075377, one or more assertions are triggered.
