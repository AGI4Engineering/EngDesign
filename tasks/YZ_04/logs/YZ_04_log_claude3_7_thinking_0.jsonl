Since the cells were tested at 40A pulses, a reasonable continuous rate would be around 25A per cell (about 62.5% of the pulse rating).\n\nTo handle 100A continuous charging:\nnumCells_p = 100A / 25A = 4 cells in parallel\n\nFor the series configuration, assuming LFP cells with nominal voltage of 3.2V and aiming for a standard module voltage of around 48V:\nnumCells_s = 48V / 3.2V = 15 cells in series\n\nThis gives us a 15S4P configuration with 60 total cells.\n\n### Task 2: Cooling System Design\n\nCalculating heat generation during fast-charging:\n- Heat generation per cell (at 25A) = (25A)² × 0.002Ω = 1.25W (assuming 2mΩ internal resistance)\n- Total heat generation = 1.25W × 60 = 75W\n\nFor cooling channel design:\n1. If we arrange 60 cells in a 15×4 grid (15 rows), placing cooling channels between rows provides uniform cooling:\n   NumChannel = 15 + 1 = 16 channels\n\n2. For channel diameter, a value that provides good flow with minimal pressure drop:\n   ChannelDia = 0.007 m (7 mm)\n\n3. For flowrate, assuming water-glycol coolant (Cp = 3500 J/kg·K, density = 1050 kg/m³):\n   Minimum flowrate to keep temperature rise below 10°C:\n   m_dot = 75W / (3500 J/kg·K × 10K) = 0.00214 kg/s\n   \n   However, for good thermal uniformity, I'll use:\n   Flowrate = 0.000033 m³/s (2 L/min)\n\nChecking pressure drop:\n- Area per channel = π × (0.007/2)² = 3.85 × 10^-5 m²\n- Velocity = 0.054 m/s\n- Reynolds number = 79.38 (laminar flow)\n- Darcy friction factor = 0.806\n- Pressure drop = 0.424 kPa < 20 kPa (well within limits)\n\nTemperature analysis:\n- Coolant temperature rise = 0.61K\n- Cell-to-coolant gradient ≈ 1.88K\n- Total gradient = 2.49K < 5K (within limits)\n\nThis design meets all constraints:\n- Temperature rise is well below 10°C\n- Temperature gradient is below 5°C\n- Pressure drop is well below 20 kPa", numCells_p=4.0, numCells_s=15.0, NumChannel=16.0, Flowrate=3.3e-05, ChannelDia=0.007), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Error': "['BattModuleThermalMgmtLFP/Solver Configuration']: At time 714.932432, one or more assertions are triggered.
