{'completion_tokens': 348, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To solve Task 1, we need to determine the maximum width of the systolic array (SA) such that the FLOPs per second utilization is at least 70% for a matrix multiplication with dimensions m=1024, k=128, n=128. The utilization is affected by the dimensions being less than the SA width. To ensure 70% utilization, we calculate the maximum width where the underutilization does not drop below this threshold. For Task 2, we calculate the minimum HBM bandwidth required to prevent stalling the computation for a given matrix multiplication with tiling strategy, considering the SRAM size and the number of tiles. For Task 3, we optimize the NPU pod configuration for prefill and decode stages of the Llama3.1-405B model, considering the given hardware specifications and SLO constraints, by tuning DP, TP, PP, batch size, and memory per chip to maximize throughput while meeting latency and memory constraints.', config=ConfigFile(max_width_SA=128, HBM_bandwidth_GBps=2765.0, prefill_DP=8, prefill_TP=4, prefill_PP=8, prefill_batch_size=32, prefill_mem_per_chip_GB=80.0, decode_DP=16, decode_TP=2, decode_PP=8, decode_batch_size=64, decode_mem_per_chip_GB=85.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'error': "'(8, 4, 8, 32)'"}, 'score': None}
