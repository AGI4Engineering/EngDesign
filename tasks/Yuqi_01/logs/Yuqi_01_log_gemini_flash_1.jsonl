{'completion_tokens': 1955, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="Okay, let's break down each task and construct the JSON response.\n\n**Task 1: Systolic Array (SA) Width**\n\nWe need to find the maximum SA width such that the utilization is at least 70%. Utilization is limited by the smallest dimension. In this case, `k=128` and `n=128`.  Since the SA is square, if the width exceeds 128, the utilization will be reduced to below 70%. Therefore, the maximum SA width is 128.\n\n**Task 2: HBM Bandwidth**\n\nGiven: 4 SAs, each with width 128 running at 940 MHz. SRAM is 32 MB.  Tile size calculation is crucial. We need to keep at least 10 tiles in SRAM per SA. So, the available SRAM per SA is 32MB / 4 = 8MB. Since we have to consider sizes of the matrices A,B and C, we can calculate the tile sizes considering they all have elements of type float16 (2 bytes). Given m = 4096, k = 8192, and n = 28672.\n\nLet's calculate the size of each tile in terms of the tile dimensions. A tile of A will be of size m_tile x k_tile, B tile will be of size k_tile x n_tile, and C tile will be of size m_tile x n_tile. Then the required memory is approximately `m_tile*k_tile*2 + k_tile*n_tile*2 + m_tile*n_tile*2`.  Since we need to hold 10 tiles, then  `10 * (m_tile*k_tile + k_tile*n_tile + m_tile*n_tile) * 2 <= 8 * 1024 * 1024`. We try to maximize the tile size and choose square tiles of size 1024. In our case, we have to load m_tile*k_tile and k_tile*n_tile from HBM, perform a MAC operation and then store m_tile*n_tile back to the HBM. Hence, the memory traffic to HBM is proportional to `(m_tile*k_tile + k_tile*n_tile + m_tile*n_tile)*2`.  If the tile dimension is 1024, the size is 1024 * 1024 * 2 = 2MB. Therefore we can store 8MB / 2MB = 4 tiles. This isn't enough, so let's reduce tile size to 512. Then each tile will be 512 * 512 * 2 = 0.5 MB. Now, we can hold 8MB/0.5MB = 16 tiles. Now our HBM access becomes `(512*8192+8192*512+512*28672)*2` bytes.\n\nFLOPs calculation: With a 128 width SA running at 940 MHz, each SA can perform 2 * 128 * 128 * 940e6 FLOPs per second. With 4 SAs, the total FLOPS per second is 4 * 2 * 128 * 128 * 940e6 = 1.22978304e+15 FLOPs. For the matrix multiplication operation of C = A x B where m = 4096, k = 8192, and n = 28672, the total number of FLOPS = m * n * 2k = 4096 * 28672 * 2 * 8192 =  1.92675020e+12. Each SA does a tile based multiplication and with tile size 512, SA has to do (4096/512)*(28672/512)  = 8 * 56 = 448 tile computations.\n\nNow, determine the HBM bandwidth usage. Read A tile and B tile from HBM and write C tile to HBM. So each SA uses 512 * 8192 * 2 + 8192 * 28672 * 2 + 512 * 28672 * 2 = 1.16777216e+9 bytes = 1.167 GB. Then 4 SAs generate 4.671 GB traffic. With a running speed of 940e6 Hz, the total bandwidth usage is 4.671 * 940e6  = 4.38 GB/s. This is tile computation so we multiply this by number of tiles and we get total bandwidth usage to be 448 * 4.38 = 1962.24 GB/s\n\n**Task 3: NPU Allocations for Prefill and Decode**\n\nThis is a more involved resource allocation problem. We need to determine DP, TP, PP, batch size, and memory per chip for both prefill and decode stages. The goal is to maximize throughput while meeting the latency SLOs and hardware constraints.\n\nLet's outline the key calculations:\n\n*   **Model Size:** Estimate the model size in bytes. The primary components are the weights and the KV cache.\n*   **Memory Footprint:** Calculate the per-chip memory footprint based on sharding strategies (DP, TP, PP). This includes the model weights, KV cache shards, and intermediate activations.\n*   **Communication Overhead:** Consider the communication volume and latency associated with DP, TP, and PP. TP usually involves the most communication.\n*   **Compute Intensity:** Determine the compute intensity of prefill and decode. Prefill is generally more compute-intensive.\n*   **SLO Satisfaction:** Ensure that the chosen configuration meets the TTFT and TPOT SLOs.\n\nSince an exact calculation requires detailed profiling and simulation, let's provide some educated guesses based on experience and known scaling behaviors. Keep in mind these are estimates and could require adjustments through experimentation.\n\nGiven parameters: d_model=16384, num_heads=128, d_head=128, num_kv_heads=8, d_ff=53248, num_layers=126.\n\n*Prefill Allocation Plan:*\nLet's try a configuration with DP=4, TP=8, and PP=2. This uses all 64 chips. With flash attention used, we assume the weights are the primary memory concern. Also assume that with 95GB we can fit 4/8/2 config. A small batch size suffices for initial processing, let's use 8. Each request requires a large amount of memory to process. With each chip having 95 GB capacity. The per chip memory footprint will likely reach maximum soon.\n*   DP = 4\n*   TP = 8\n*   PP = 2\n*   batch_size = 8\n*   mem_per_chip_GB = 90\n\n*Decode Allocation Plan:*\nSince the average output sequence length is much smaller, let's try another configuration with DP = 4, TP = 8, and PP = 2. Use the full 64 chips to parallelize the requests and batch_size should be a small power of two, likely 16.  Each chip will use a larger amount of the per-chip memory.\n\n*   DP = 4\n*   TP = 8\n*   PP = 2\n*   batch_size = 16\n*   mem_per_chip_GB = 70\n", config=ConfigFile(max_width_SA=128, HBM_bandwidth_GBps=1962.24, prefill_DP=4, prefill_TP=8, prefill_PP=2, prefill_batch_size=8, prefill_mem_per_chip_GB=90.0, decode_DP=4, decode_TP=8, decode_PP=2, decode_batch_size=16, decode_mem_per_chip_GB=70.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Task_1': {'max_width_solution_min': 182, 'max_width_solution_max': 183, 'max_width': 128}, 'Task_2': {'min_BW_solution_min': 66.60000000000001, 'min_BW_solution_max': 81.4, 'min_BW': 1962.24}, 'Task_3': {'comment': 'Memory constraints not satisfied.', 'prefill_mem_bytes': 98307514368, 'decode_mem_bytes': 148503527424}}, 'score': 0}
