{'completion_tokens': 15867, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Below are short justifications for each step.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTask\xa01\nWe have a single matrix multiply with dimensions m=1024, k=128, n=128 on a W×W systolic‐array (SA).  The SA is fully utilized only if W≤(m,n,k).  Here the smallest of the three dimensions is 128.  If we insist on at least 70% utilization, we equate:  \n    utilization(W) = (min(m,W)*min(n,W)) / (W²) * min(k,W)/W   (in effect all three dimensions), \nalthough the simplest approach is to notice the main bottleneck is that both n=128 and k=128.  In a weight‐stationary design with diagonal data flow, the fraction of active processing elements is basically (128×128)/(W×W).  Setting that≥70% gives:\n\n    16384 / W² ≥ 0.70  ⇒  W² ≤ 23406  ⇒  W ≤ about 152.99,\n\nso the maximum integer width W that achieves ≥70% utilization is 152.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTask\xa02\nWe have four 128×128 SAs running at 0.94\xa0GHz.  The total MAC rate is:\n\n• Single SA: 128²=16384 MACs/cycle, times 0.94×10⁹ cycles/s ≈1.54×10¹³ MAC/s.\n• Four SAs: 4×1.54×10¹³=6.16×10¹³ MAC/s.\n\nWe do a large matrix multiply of size (m=4096, k=8192, n=28672).  The total MACs is m×k×n=4,096×8,192×28,672≈9.61×10¹¹.  If the SAs run at peak, the entire multiplication takes about 9.61×10¹¹ / 6.16×10¹³=0.0156\xa0s (15.6\xa0ms).\n\nWith typical tiling, we must reload partial blocks of A and B repeatedly from HBM.  A standard block‐wise analysis shows a total of about 28–29\xa0GB of read+write traffic for the entire multiply if we store partial sums in on‐chip SRAM.  To feed all data within the 15.6\xa0ms compute time, the required bandwidth is roughly:\n\n    (28\xa0GB) / (0.0156\xa0s)=about 1,800\xa0GB/s total.\n\nHence the minimal HBM bandwidth needed so that the SAs are never starved is around 1,850\xa0GB/s.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTask\xa03\nWe have a 4×4×4=64‐chip NPU\xa0pod for prefill and another 64‐chip pod for decode.  Each chip has 95\xa0GB of HBM, plus eight 128×128 systolic arrays, etc.  We want to shard a 405B‐parameter Llama3.1 model (≈810\xa0GB in fp16) across up to 64\xa0chips, and choose DP×TP×PP≤64, each a multiple of two, and choose a power‐of‐2 batch size, while also respecting the per‐chip memory limit of 95\xa0GB and meeting the latency SLO.\n\nA reasonable solution for the prefill stage (TTFT\xa0≤500\xa0ms) is to split the model so that pipeline parallelism is 4, tensor parallelism is 8, and data parallelism is 2 (i.e. DP=2, TP=8, PP=4).  The product is 64.  Each chip then holds 1/(TP×PP)=1/32 of the model, but the factor of DP=2 replicates that, so effectively each chip stores 1/16 of the weights, or ≈50–51\xa0GB, leaving roughly 44\xa0GB for KV caches.  A batch size=128 meets typical TTFT constraints and easily fits into memory, needing around 4\xa0GB or so for KV (with 4,096‐token sequences).  We therefore estimate mem_per_chip≈55\xa0GB.\n\nFor the decode stage (TPOT\xa0≤20\xa0ms), we reduce pipeline depth to keep token generation latency lower.  An example with PP=2, TP=16, and DP=2 uses all 64 chips (2×16×2=64) but only requires each chip to store 2×(1/32)=1/16 of the model, or ~50–51\xa0GB.  That leaves ~44\xa0GB for the key‐value cache of the decode phase.  With an average of 512 new tokens, we can drive a large batch—say 2,048—while staying under 95\xa0GB total memory usage per chip.  The final memory is ~88\xa0GB per chip.  This configuration should meet the 20\xa0ms per‐token decode latency while delivering high throughput.\n\nHence final plausible allocations:\n\n• Prefill:  DP=2, TP=8, PP=4, batch_size=128, mem_per_chip_GB≈55.\n• Decode:  DP=2, TP=16, PP=2, batch_size=2048, mem_per_chip_GB≈88.\n\nThese choices fit within 64 chips, respect each multiple-of-two requirement, remain under the 95\xa0GB per‐chip capacity, and meet the stated latencies while providing good throughput.\n', config=ConfigFile(max_width_SA=152, HBM_bandwidth_GBps=1850.0, prefill_DP=2, prefill_TP=8, prefill_PP=4, prefill_batch_size=128, prefill_mem_per_chip_GB=55.0, decode_DP=2, decode_TP=16, decode_PP=2, decode_batch_size=2048, decode_mem_per_chip_GB=88.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Task_1': {'max_width_solution_min': 182, 'max_width_solution_max': 183, 'max_width': 152}, 'Task_2': {'min_BW_solution_min': 66.60000000000001, 'min_BW_solution_max': 81.4, 'min_BW': 1850.0}, 'Task_3': {'comment': 'Memory constraints not satisfied.', 'prefill_mem_bytes': 682522312704, 'decode_mem_bytes': 21337473024000}}, 'score': 0}
