## Rubric for Evaluating RSLQR Controller Design Response
Assess how good the controller is at tracking the step input and the performance.
| Criterion | Points | Description |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| Settling time | 30 | The 5% settling time of the system is faster than 5s |
| Overshoot | 20 | The overshoot of the system is smaller than 20% |
| Error | 30 | The error of the final value is 0 |
| Gain margin | 10 | The gain margin should be bigger than 10 dB |
| Phase margin | 10 |The phase margin should be bigger than 45 degrees |

Note: If the system is unstable, the score will be 0, no matter how good the performance is.
