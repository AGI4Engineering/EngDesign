A typical approach is to target a crossover frequency of roughly 1 rad/s to meet the settling‑time requirement (less than 5 seconds) while limiting overshoot (under 20%). A moderate derivative term provides adequate phase margin (>45°) and enhances stability (gain margin >10 dB). The integral term ensures zero steady‑state error.
