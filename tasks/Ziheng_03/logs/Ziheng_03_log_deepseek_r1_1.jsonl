The plant's third-order dynamics were analyzed using frequency response methods. Targeting a crossover frequency around 1.2 rad/s provided a phase margin of ~45Â° and gain margin >10 dB. Kp=4.5 and Kd=0.9 were chosen to provide sufficient phase lead and gain, while Ki=0.13 introduces the necessary integral action without destabilizing the system.
