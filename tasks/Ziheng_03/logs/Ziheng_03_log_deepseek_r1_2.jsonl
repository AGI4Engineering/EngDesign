The plant's poles at -2, -1, and -0.5 are addressed by the controller's zeros at -1 and -0.5, canceling two poles and introducing an integrator for zero steady-state error. The proportional gain (Kp=8.33) ensures sufficient phase margin (59.2°) and gain margin (infinite), while the integral (Ki=2.78) and derivative (Kd=5.56) gains provide damping (ζ=0.6) to achieve <20% overshoot and settling time ~4s.
