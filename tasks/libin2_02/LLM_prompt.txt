### Task Description

In this task, you need to choose an appropriate Round-Robin time quantum (time_quantum) for a set of threads in order to minimize the **combined cost**.  
We will calculate three cost components:  
1. Average waiting time(avg_waiting_time), in milliseconds (ms). Smaller is better.  
2. Number of context switches(context_switches). Each switch counts as 1 ms of overhead. Fewer is better.  
3. Time quantum cost(quantum_cost), reflecting the negative impact of too long a time quantum, defined as: quantum_cost = time_quantum * 0.5

The combined cost(combined_cost) is the sum of these three components.


### Input
The thread list is given as tuples (arrival_time, burst_time), both in ms:
case1 = [(0,5),(2,3),(4,8),(6,6),(8,4)]
case2 = [(0,10),(1,2),(3,7),(5,5)]
case3 = [(0,2),(2,2),(4,2),(6,2),(8,2),(10,2)]

### Requirements
Choose a single time quantum such that the combined cost for each case does not exceed:  
- case1: 17 ms  
- case2: 17 ms  
- case3: 8 ms 

Return the chosen time_quantum and, for each case, the corresponding avg_waiting_time, context_switches, and quantum_cost.
