{'completion_tokens': 1617, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="I need to choose a time quantum that results in combined costs below the specified thresholds for each case. I'll start by considering the constraints and relative burst times. Case 3 has very short burst times, so a small time quantum would probably be ideal there. Case 1 and 2 has higher burst times. I will choose time_quantum=2 and determine the average waiting time, number of context switches, and quantum cost for each case.\n\nCase 1: [(0,5),(2,3),(4,8),(6,6),(8,4)] with time quantum = 2\n- Thread 1: Burst = 5.
