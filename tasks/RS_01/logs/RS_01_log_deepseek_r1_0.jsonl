Solving 0.61v³ + 714.17v = 315207 gives v ≈ 75.39 m/s (271.4 km/h). For Task 2, lap time is estimated by summing segment times where speed is limited by cornering grip (a_lat_max = 13.734 m/s²) or top speed. High-curvature segments (e.g., curvature=0.0453 at 6040m) limit speed to ~17.41 m/s. Total track length (6950m) divided by an estimated average speed (~41.67 m/s) yields ~166.8 seconds.
