With transmission efficiency: 397,936 × 0.95 = 378,039 W at the wheels.\n\n**Top Speed Calculation:**\nLet me check the maximum achievable speed in the top two gears, considering both engine RPM limits and power vs. drag equilibrium.\n\nFor 6th gear (ratio 4.0):\nAt 10,000 RPM, speed = 2π × 10000 × 0.32/(60 × 4.0) = 83.78 m/s\n\nThe drag force at this speed (assuming frontal area of 1.5 m²):\nF_drag = 0.5 × ρ × v² × cx × A = 0.5 × 1.22 × (83.78)² × 1.0 × 1.5 = 6,432.18 N\n\nTractive force at 10,000 RPM in 6th gear:\nF_traction = 0.95 × 380 × 4.0/0.32 = 4,512.5 N\n\nSince F_drag > F_traction, the car can't maintain this speed. Finding the equilibrium point where F_drag = F_traction gives approximately 70.5 m/s.\n\nFor 5th gear (ratio 4.5):\nAt 10,000 RPM, speed = 2π × 10000 × 0.32/(60 × 4.5) = 74.47 m/s\n\nThe drag force at this speed:\nF_drag = 0.5 × 1.22 × (74.47)² × 1.0 × 1.5 = 5,082.45 N\n\nTractive force at 10,000 RPM in 5th gear:\nF_traction = 0.95 × 380 × 4.5/0.32 = 5,076.56 N\n\nThese forces are nearly equal, indicating that the car can reach approximately 74.5 m/s in 5th gear.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe maximum speed is achieved in 5th gear at approximately 74.5 m/s, or 268.2 km/h.", config=ConfigFile(vcarmax=268.2, laptime=120.47)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'laptime_sol': np.float64(121.054), 'vcarmax_sol': np.float64(82.379), 'Lap_time_differnce': np.float64(0.5840000000000032), 'Top_speed_difference': np.float64(-185.82099999999997)}, 'score': 0}
