{'completion_tokens': 31687, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To find the maximum speed, I analyzed both power/drag limitations and lateral grip limitations. For power limitations, I calculated the maximum power available (299.6 kW) and the total drag force (including profile drag and induced drag from downforce). At maximum speed, power equals drag force times velocity, giving 62.2 m/s or 223.9 km/h. For lateral grip limitations, I used the formula v_max = √(g×gripy/c) for each corner. The highest curvature of 0.045 gives a speed limit of 17.5 m/s. Since straight sections have near-zero curvature, the maximum speed on the lap is the power-limited 223.9 km/h. For the minimum lap time, I categorized the track into segments based on curvature ranges, calculated the average speed for each category, and determined that over the 6950m track, the minimum possible lap time is 141.1 seconds.', config=ConfigFile(vcarmax=223.9, laptime=141.1)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'laptime_sol': np.float64(121.054), 'vcarmax_sol': np.float64(82.379), 'Lap_time_differnce': np.float64(-20.045999999999992), 'Top_speed_difference': np.float64(-141.52100000000002)}, 'score': 0}
