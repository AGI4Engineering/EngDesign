Translate the specification into an equivalent 1-D beam-bending problem.\n   • Total span L = 1000 mm, width b = 40 mm, unknown thickness (height) Th.\n   • Pressure applied only on the outer half of the top face.\n     - Magnitude: 1000 N ÷ ( (L/2)·b ) = 0.05 N/mm².\n     - Over the 500 mm long × 40 mm wide area ➜ line load q = 0.05 · 40 = 2 N/mm acting from x = 500 mm to x = 1000 mm.\n   • Material: E = 2.1×10⁵ N/mm², ν = 0.3 (ν does not affect small-deflection bending stiffness).\n\n2. Estimate the maximum vertical deflection with elementary beam theory (conservative but quick):\n   • Replace the distributed load by an equivalent line load acting on the last half-length; the elastic line solution for a cantilever with partial uniform load gives\n        δ_max ≈ (q·a²·(3L – a)) / (6·E·I) ,  where a = 750 mm is the centroid of the loaded segment and I = b·Th³/12.\n   • Substituting numbers and rearranging gives\n        δ_max ≈ 3.015×10⁵ / Th³  (mm).\n\n3. Target a displacement ratio between 70 % and 90 % of the 2 mm limit (i.e. 1.4–1.8 mm) to maximise the score while keeping an adequate safety margin.\n   • Picking δ_target ≈ 1.4 mm (ratio = 0.70) yields\n        Th³ ≥ 3.015×10⁵ / 1.4 ≈ 2.154×10⁵  ⇒  Th ≈ 60 mm.\n   • This choice remains safely below the 2 mm ceiling even if the simple beam model under-predicts the FE-computed deflection by ~15 %.  It is also slightly stiffer than the purely analytical requirement, giving a ratio expected around 0.68–0.75, comfortably inside (or very near) the full-credit window.\n\n4. Check practical aspects:\n   • The width-to-height ratio b/Th = 40/60 ≈ 0.67, a perfectly reasonable slenderness for a plate-like cantilever.\n   • Fabrication practicality: 60 mm plate/thickness is a stock size in structural steel and easy to model in the PDE Toolbox.\n\nTherefore a thickness of 60 mm provides the desired stiffness, keeps the maximum displacement safely under 2 mm, and should score near the top of the grading scale.', config=ConfigFile(Th=60.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 1.4105988485415837, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 100.0}
