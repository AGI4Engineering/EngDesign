{'completion_tokens': 1039, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="1. **Objective**: Determine beam thickness `Th` such that the maximum vertical displacement `uy` is between `1.4 mm` and `1.8 mm`. This range corresponds to 70% to 90% of the 2mm allowable displacement, which yields the maximum score.\n2. **Beam & Loading Configuration**:\n    *   The beam is a cantilever of Length `L = 1000 mm` and Width `w = 40 mm`.\n    *   A uniform pressure `P_load = 1000 N / (L/2 * w) = 1000 N / (500 mm * 40 mm) = 0.05 N/mm^2` is applied.\n    *   This pressure acts on the outer half of the top face, from `x = L/2` to `x = L`. This translates to a uniformly distributed line load `q = P_load * w = 0.05 N/mm^2 * 40 mm = 2 N/mm` over this segment.\n3. **Material Properties**: Young's Modulus `E = 210,000 MPa = 210,000 N/mm^2`.\n4. **Beam Theory Deflection Formula**: For a cantilever beam with a uniformly distributed load `q` applied from `a=L/2` to `L` (the free end), the maximum deflection `uy_max` at the free end is given by the formula: `uy_max = (11 * q * L^4) / (384 * E * I)`.\n5. **Moment of Inertia**: For a rectangular cross-section, the area moment of inertia `I` is `w * Th^3 / 12`. Substituting `w = 40 mm`, we get `I = (40 * Th^3) / 12 = (10/3) * Th^3 mm^4`.\n6. **Deflection Equation in terms of Th**: Substituting all known values into the deflection formula:\n    `uy_max = (11 * (2 N/mm) * (1000 mm)^4) / (384 * (210000 N/mm^2) * ((10/3) * Th^3 mm^4))`\n    `uy_max = (22 * 10^12 N*mm^3) / (128 * 210000 N/mm^2 * 10 mm^4 * Th^3)`\n    `uy_max = (22 * 10^12) / (2688 * 10^5 * Th^3) mm = 81845.238 / Th^3 mm`.\n7. **Choosing Th**: The scoring is asymmetric: falling below 70% of the threshold is penalized less severely than exceeding 90%. Additionally, 3D FEM simulations often predict slightly higher deflections than 1D Euler-Bernoulli beam theory (e.g., due to shear deformation, Poisson's ratio effects, and specific modeling of boundary conditions and load application). Therefore, it is prudent to target a deflection in the lower part of the optimal range [1.4 mm, 1.8 mm].\n    Let's choose `Th = 38.5 mm`.\n    This proposed thickness yields a theoretical beam deflection:\n    `uy_max = 81845.238 / (38.5^3) = 81845.238 / 57066.625 = 1.4342 mm`.\n    This deflection is `1.4342 mm / 2.0 mm = 71.71%` of the allowable limit, which is within the optimal [70%, 90%] range.\n8. **Robustness**: This choice of `Th = 38.5 mm` allows the actual FEM deflection to be up to approximately 25.5% higher than the beam theory prediction (i.e., `1.4342 * 1.255 = 1.80 mm`) and still achieve full score. It also allows the FEM deflection to be about 2.4% lower (`1.4342 * 0.976 = 1.40 mm`) and maintain full score. This provides a good margin for potential deviations between beam theory and 3D FEM results.", config=ConfigFile(Th=38.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 5.3289824409712585, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
