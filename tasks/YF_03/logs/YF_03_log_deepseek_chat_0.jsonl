{'completion_tokens': 244, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To determine a suitable thickness (Th) for the steel cantilever beam, we need to ensure that the maximum vertical displacement (uy) is less than 2 mm under the given load. The beam is subjected to a uniform load over the outer half of its length, and the displacement is influenced by the beam's stiffness, which depends on its thickness. Given the fixed parameters (L = 1000 mm, w = 40 mm, Young’s modulus = 210,000 MPa, Poisson’s ratio = 0.3), we can estimate a thickness that keeps the displacement within the desired range. A thicker beam will be stiffer and thus have less displacement, but it must not be so thick that the displacement falls below 70% of the allowable threshold (1.4 mm). Based on typical cantilever beam deflection formulas and considering the load distribution, a thickness of 20 mm is proposed as a reasonable starting point. This value balances stiffness and material usage while aiming to keep the displacement between 70% and 90% of the 2 mm threshold.", config=ConfigFile(Th=20.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 37.976202933596774, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
