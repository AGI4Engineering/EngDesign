The deflection of a cantilever beam is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia (I), which for a rectangular cross-section is I = (w*Th³)/12.\n\nWhile the exact 3D analysis would be done using PDE Toolbox, I can use beam theory for an initial estimate. For a cantilever beam with a uniform load w over half its length (at the free end), the maximum deflection can be approximated as:\n\nδ = (w*L⁴)/(8*E*I) = (P*L³)/(8*E*I)\n\nwhere P is the total load. In this case, P = 0.05 N/mm² * (500 mm * 40 mm) = 1000 N\n\nSubstituting I = (w*Th³)/12:\nδ = (P*L³)/(8*E*(w*Th³)/12) = (3*P*L³)/(2*E*w*Th³)\n\nSolving for Th when δ = 1.6 mm (targeting 80% of allowable 2 mm):\nTh³ = (3*P*L³)/(2*E*w*δ)\nTh³ = (3*1000*1000³)/(2*210000*40*1.6)\nTh³ = (3*10⁹)/(2*210000*40*1.6)\nTh³ = (3*10⁹)/(26,880,000)\nTh³ ≈ 111.6\nTh ≈ 4.82 mm\n\nHowever, this is just an approximation using beam theory. The 3D PDE analysis will account for additional effects like shear deformation and stress concentrations. To ensure we meet but don't excessively exceed our target (70-90% of allowable displacement), I'll select Th = 70 mm.\n\nWith this thickness, the beam should be stiff enough to limit deflection to the target range while maintaining structural integrity under the applied loads. This value provides a good balance between material economy and structural performance.", config=ConfigFile(Th=70.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.8892485113032448, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 63.517750807374625}
