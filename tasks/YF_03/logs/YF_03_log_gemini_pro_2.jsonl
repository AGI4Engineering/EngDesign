Material: Young's modulus E = 210,000 MPa (N/mm^2), Poisson's ratio nu = 0.3. The maximum vertical displacement (uy_max) must be less than 2 mm. The optimal score is achieved if the ratio of measured displacement to the 2mm threshold is between 0.7 and 0.9 (i.e., displacement between 1.4 mm and 1.8 mm).\n2.  Calculate applied load: A constant downward pressure is applied on the outer half of the top face (from x=L/2 to x=L). Total force is 1000 N. The loaded area is (L/2) * w = (1000mm/2) * 40mm = 500mm * 40mm = 20,000 mm^2. The pressure magnitude P_load = 1000 N / 20,000 mm^2 = 0.05 N/mm^2. This pressure acts over the width w, so it's equivalent to a uniformly distributed line load q = P_load * w = 0.05 N/mm^2 * 40 mm = 2 N/mm. This line load is applied from x = L/2 = 500 mm to x = L = 1000 mm.\n3.  Select beam theory: Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is suitable for a slender cantilever beam. The beam's length-to-width ratio (L/w = 1000/40 = 25) and anticipated length-to-thickness ratio (L/Th) are expected to be large enough for this theory to be accurate.\n4.  Determine deflection formula: For a cantilever beam fixed at x=0, subjected to a uniformly distributed load q starting at x=L/2 and ending at x=L, the deflection at the free end (x=L) can be derived using methods like Macaulay's method or superposition. The resulting formula for maximum deflection is delta = (41 * q * L^4) / (384 * E * I). The moment of inertia (I) for a rectangular cross-section is I = (w * Th^3) / 12.\n5.  Set target deflection: To achieve the maximum score, the target deflection (delta_target) should be within the 1.4 mm to 1.8 mm range. Choosing the midpoint, delta_target = (1.4 + 1.8) / 2 = 1.6 mm, is a good strategy.\n6.  Substitute known values and solve for Th (thickness):\n    Moment of Inertia I = (40 mm * Th^3) / 12 = (10/3) * Th^3 mm^4.\n    Young's Modulus E = 210,000 N/mm^2.\n    Line load q = 2 N/mm.\n    Length L = 1000 mm.\n    Setting delta_target = 1.6 mm:\n    1.6 = (41 * 2 * (1000)^4) / (384 * 210000 * (10/3) * Th^3)\n    1.6 = (82 * 10^12) / ( (384 * 210000 * 10 / 3) * Th^3 )\n    1.6 = (82 * 10^12) / ( (128 * 210000 * 10) * Th^3 )\n    1.6 = (82 * 10^12) / ( 2688 * 10^5 * Th^3 )\n    1.6 = 305059.5238 / Th^3\n    Th^3 = 305059.5238 / 1.6\n    Th^3 = 190662.202375 mm^3\n    Th = (190662.202375)^(1/3) mm = 57.550 mm.\n7.  Propose final Th value: Rounding Th to a practical value, Th = 57.5 mm is proposed. \n    Let's verify the deflection with Th = 57.5 mm:\n    delta = 305059.5238 / (57.5)^3 = 305059.5238 / 190109.375 = 1.6046 mm.\n    The ratio of this deflection to the 2mm limit is 1.6046 / 2 = 0.8023. This ratio (80.23%) falls within the optimal 70% to 90% range.
