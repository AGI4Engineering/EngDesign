Calculate the applied pressure:\n   p = 1000 N / [(L/2)·w] = 1000 / (500·40) = 0.05 N/mm².\n   This acts on the outer half of the top face (x = 500 – 1000 mm).\n\n2. Convert to an equivalent line load along the beam length:\n   q = p·w = 0.05 N/mm² × 40 mm = 2 N/mm (uniform between x = 500 mm and x = 1000 mm).\n\n3. Tip-deflection for a cantilever under a uniform load acting over the last k = L/2 = 500 mm (from x = a = 500 mm to x = L):\n   Using singular-function integration, the closed-form expression gives\n   δ_max = (q / (E·I))·[k⁴ / 8 + k·(polynomial in L and a)] ≈ 2.135·10¹¹ / (E·I).\n\n4. Impose the service limit δ_allow = 2 mm:\n   E·I ≥ 1.068·10¹¹ N·mm² ⇒ I_req ≈ 5.1·10⁵ mm⁴ (with E = 210 000 N/mm²).\n\n5. For a rectangular section (width w = 40 mm, height = Th):\n   I = w·Th³ / 12  ⇒  Th_req ≈ 53–54 mm to reach the 2 mm limit.\n\n6. Scoring prefers the displacement ratio R = δ/δ_allow in the 0.70–0.90 band (≈1.4–1.8 mm).  Because Euler-Bernoulli theory neglects shear-flexibility that the 3-D solver will include, the real deflection will be slightly larger than the beam-theory estimate.  To land near the middle of the desired band we therefore increase Th modestly:\n   Choosing Th = 60 mm gives I = 40·60³/12 = 7.2·10⁵ mm⁴.\n   Predicted δ ≈ 2 mm × (I_req / I) ≈ 2 × 0.71 ≈ 1.4 mm.\n   Allowing 5-10 % extra deflection from shear, the expected ratio R becomes ≈0.75–0.80, comfortably inside the 0.70–0.90 window and well below the 2 mm limit.\n\n7.
