Input data\n   • Span  L = 1000 mm\n   • Width b = 40 mm (constant)\n   • Unknown thickness h = Th (vertical depth of the rectangular section)\n   • Uniform pressure p is applied only on the outer half of the top face:  p = 1000 /(L/2·b) = 1000 /(500·40) = 0.05 N/mm².\n   • Hence the distributed line load along the beam axis is   q = p·b = 0.05 N/mm² · 40 mm = 2 N/mm, acting from x = 500 mm to x = 1000 mm.\n   • Material:  E = 210 000 N/mm²,  ν = 0.3.\n   • Allowable vertical deflection:  δ_allow = 2 mm.\n\n2.  Simplified beam-theory estimate of the maximum deflection\n   • Treat the beam as an Euler-Bernoulli cantilever of length L with a partial UDL q acting over the last 500 mm.\n   • The exact closed-form solution for a partial UDL can be obtained by superposition, but a handy way is:  δ_partial = δ_full − δ_first-half.\n        – Full UDL over 0…L:   δ_full = q·L⁴ /(8·E·I).\n        – UDL over 0…L/2:     δ_0-L/2 ≈ q·(0.5L)²·(3L − 0.5L)/(6·E·I)  (equivalent point-load representation at its centroid).\n        – Combining gives       δ_partial ≈ 1.05×10⁶ / I   (mm).\n   • For a rectangular section I = b·h³ / 12 = 40·h³ / 12 = (10/3)·h³.\n   • Therefore δ_partial ≈ 316 220 / h³   (mm).\n\n3.  Thickness that meets the 2 mm limit\n   • Setting δ_partial = 2 mm ⇒ h³ ≈ 158 110 ⇒ h ≈ 54 mm.\n\n4.  Thickness that places the deflection in the 70–90 % preferred band\n   • Target deflection range: 1.4–1.8 mm.\n   • Using δ = 316 220 / h³, the corresponding h values are:\n        – δ = 1.8 mm → h ≈ 56 mm\n        – δ = 1.4 mm → h ≈ 60 mm\n   • A value in the middle, h = 57 mm, yields a predicted δ ≈ 1.7 mm → δ/δ_allow ≈ 0.85, comfortably inside 0.70–0.90.\n\n5.  Safety and modelling considerations\n   • The analytical estimate is conservative because it replaces the distributed load by an equivalent point load for the subtraction term and ignores 3-D shear flexibility; the true 3-D numerical deflection will therefore be equal to or smaller than the estimate, giving a slight extra safety margin.\n   • A thickness of 57 mm keeps stresses low (maximum bending stress σ_max ≈ M_max·h/2I ≈ 90 MPa, far below the steel yield strength) while avoiding unnecessary weight increase.\n\n6.  Conclusion\n   • Choosing Th = 57 mm should result in a simulated maximum vertical displacement around 1.6–1.8 mm, i.e. 80–90 % of the allowable limit, which secures the full score range by the problem’s grading rule and provides an efficient, lightweight design.', config=ConfigFile(Th=57.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 1.6447079122827941, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 100.0}
