{'completion_tokens': 140, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The goal is to find a thickness (Th) for a steel cantilever beam that results in a maximum vertical displacement (uy) less than 2 mm under a given load.  To achieve this, I need to balance stiffness (related to Th) with the applied load. Since the beam is a cantilever beam, increasing the thickness will significantly increase its stiffness and reduce the displacement. I will start with a reasonable guess of 20mm. This seems like a good balance of stiffness and material usage, and can be adjusted later if the displacement exceeds the limit.', config=ConfigFile(Th=20.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 37.976202933596774, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
