Over the width w = 40 mm this becomes a line load q = p·w = 2 N/mm acting on the outer half-length (a = L/2 = 500 mm).\n\n2.  Bending model –  Treat the member as a slender rectangular beam (Euler-Bernoulli).  For a cantilever with a uniformly distributed load acting over the last a millimetres, the tip deflection is\n      δ = q·L⁴·(41/384)/(E·I).\n   With E = 210 000 N/mm² and the second moment of area I = (w·Th³)/12 = (40·Th³)/12, this simplifies to\n      δ [mm] ≈ 305.1 / Th³.\n\n3.  Target deflection –  To receive the full score the displacement ratio r = δ / 2 mm should lie between 0.70 and 0.90.  Selecting r ≈ 0.78 (mid-range) gives δ ≈ 1.56 mm.\n\n4.  Solve for Th –\n      305.1 / Th³ = 1.56  ⇒  Th³ ≈ 1.906·10⁵  ⇒  Th ≈ 58 mm.\n\n5.  Checks –  \n   • Predicted r = 1.56 / 2 = 0.78 (well inside the 0.70–0.90 band).\n   • Shear-deflection estimate (V·L/(kAG)) adds <0.5 % to δ, so 3-D and shear effects will not push r outside the desired window.\n   • 58 mm keeps the section reasonably compact (height-to-width ≈ 1.45) and is easy to fabricate from standard plate or rolled sections.\n\nHence a thickness of about 58 mm provides a safe, efficient design that should achieve the maximum score after simulation.', config=ConfigFile(Th=58.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 1.561341945213519, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 100.0}
