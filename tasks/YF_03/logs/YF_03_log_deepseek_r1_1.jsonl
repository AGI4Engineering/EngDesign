Using simplified beam deflection formulas for a cantilever with a partial uniform load, the displacement δ is inversely proportional to Th³. Calculations show that Th ≈43 mm yields δ≈1.59 mm (79.5% of 2 mm), safely within the target range. This balances stiffness and material efficiency while accounting for uncertainties in 3D simulation effects.', config=ConfigFile(Th=43.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 3.8266625653945834, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
