The beam is subjected to a uniform load on the outer half of the top face, and we need to consider the material properties and geometric constraints.\n\n1. **Understanding the Load and Material Properties:**\n   - The beam is 1000 mm long and 40 mm wide.\n   - The load is applied over the half-length area, i.e., from 500 mm to 1000 mm.\n   - The load magnitude is 1000/(L/2*w) N/mm², which simplifies to 1000/(500*40) = 0.05 N/mm².\n   - The material has a Young's modulus of 210,000 MPa and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3.\n\n2. **Displacement Criteria:**\n   - The maximum allowable displacement is 2 mm.\n   - The performance score is based on the ratio of the actual displacement to the allowable displacement.\n\n3. **Calculating the Required Thickness (Th):**\n   - The displacement of a cantilever beam under a uniform load can be estimated using beam theory. For a rectangular cross-section, the displacement is inversely proportional to the thickness cubed (Th^3).\n   - To ensure the displacement is less than 2 mm, we need to choose a thickness that provides sufficient stiffness.\n\n4. **Proposing a Thickness:**\n   - A reasonable starting point for the thickness can be estimated using the formula for maximum displacement of a cantilever beam: \n     \\[ \\delta_{max} = \\frac{qL^4}{8EI} \\]\n     where \\( q \\) is the load per unit area, \\( L \\) is the length, \\( E \\) is the Young's modulus, and \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia.\n   - The moment of inertia \\( I \\) for a rectangular section is \\( \\frac{wTh^3}{12} \\).\n   - Solving for Th to ensure \\( \\delta_{max} < 2 \\) mm, we can start with an initial guess and adjust based on the simulation results.\n\n5. **Initial Guess for Th:**\n   - Given the constraints and the need for a balance between stiffness and material usage, an initial guess for Th could be around 20 mm. This provides a reasonable starting point for the simulation to ensure the displacement is within the allowable limit while considering the material's stiffness and the applied load.", config=ConfigFile(Th=20.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 37.976202933596774, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
