Starting with the problem parameters (L=1000mm, w=40mm, distributed load of 0.05 N/mmÂ² on the outer half), I calculated the total force (1000N) and approximated it as acting at 3L/4 from the fixed end. Using the deflection formula for cantilever beams and solving for thickness to achieve approximately 80% of the allowed 2mm deflection (1.6mm), I calculated a required thickness of about 50.1mm. To account for 3D effects, distributed loading considerations, and to ensure we stay within the optimal 70-90% deflection range, I slightly increased this to 51mm.', config=ConfigFile(Th=51.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 2.2949824585870653, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
