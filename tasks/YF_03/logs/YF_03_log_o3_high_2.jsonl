The surface pressure is specified as p = 1000 /(L/2·w) = 1000 /(500·40) = 0.05 N/mm² and it acts only on the outer half of the beam (x = 500 – 1000 mm).\n2. Converting the pressure into a line load along the beam axis gives q = p·w = 0.05 × 40 = 2 N/mm distributed from x = 500 mm to x = 1000 mm; the inner half is unloaded.  Total vertical force F = q·(L/2) = 2 × 500 = 1000 N (checks with the statement).\n3. Model the member as a slender, prismatic, Euler–Bernoulli cantilever of length L = 1000 mm, width b = 40 mm and unknown height (thickness) Th.  The second moment of area is I = b·Th³ / 12.\n4. The elastic tip deflection produced by a uniform load acting over the outer half can be written (after piece-wise integration of the bending-moment equation) as:\n   δ_max = ( q·(L/2) )·[ (11L³ – 6L²·(L/2) + (L/2)³) ] /(24·E·I )\n   Substituting L = 1000 mm and simplifying gives the compact numerical form\n  \u2003\u2003δ_max (mm) ≈ 372 000 / I\n5. To earn full credit the displacement ratio δ_max / 2 mm should be between 0.70 and 0.90, i.e. δ_max ≈ 1.4 – 1.8 mm.  Choosing a mid-range target δ_target ≈ 1.6 mm gives the required inertia\n  \u2003\u2003I_req = 372 000 / 1.6 ≈ 2.33 × 10⁵ mm⁴.\n6. Converting back to thickness:\n  \u2003\u2003Th³ = 12 I_req / b = 12·2.33·10⁵ / 40 ≈ 6.98 × 10⁴ → Th ≈ 41 mm.\n7. A small upward adjustment (≈ 3 %) is applied to compensate for additional shear deformation captured in the full 3-D solid model and for possible mesh-related softening.  This leads to the final choice:\n  \u2003\u2003Th = 42 mm.\n8. With Th = 42 mm the estimated beam deflection is about 1.5 mm (≈ 75 % of the 2 mm limit), comfortably inside the 70–90 % optimum band while still leaving a safety margin below the 2 mm cap.  The section remains fairly compact (L/Th ≈ 24) and is practical for fabrication.', config=ConfigFile(Th=42.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 4.106581329515715, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
