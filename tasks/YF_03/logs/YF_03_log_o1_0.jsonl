{'completion_tokens': 3986, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A straightforward way to estimate a suitable height (Th) is by approximating the uniform load on the half‐span as a single equivalent force of 1000\u202fN acting near 750\u202fmm from the fixed end. Treating the cross-section as 40\u202fmm wide by Th\u202fmm thick (with the second moment of area I = 40·Th³/12), a classical beam deflection formula suggests that around 6\u202fmm thickness keeps the tip deflection near but below 2\u202fmm. Approximations using 5.5–6\u202fmm indicate a deflection ratio (i.e. deflection / 2\u202fmm) comfortably between 70% and 90%, balancing stiffness with material usage while meeting the <2\u202fmm deflection requirement.', config=ConfigFile(Th=6.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 1401.6457892059286, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
