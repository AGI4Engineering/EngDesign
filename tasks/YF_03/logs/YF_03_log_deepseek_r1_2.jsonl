{'completion_tokens': 6356, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The task requires selecting a beam thickness (Th) such that the maximum vertical displacement (uy) is between 70% (1.4 mm) and 90% (1.8 mm) of the 2 mm limit. Using beam deflection formulas for a cantilever with a partial uniform load, the analytical solution suggests Th ≈ 31–33 mm achieves this range. A thickness of 32 mm is chosen to balance stiffness and loading constraints, ensuring the displacement remains within the optimal scoring range while accounting for potential 3D simulation effects (e.g., shear deformation). This value prioritizes geometric efficiency and compliance with the performance criterion.', config=ConfigFile(Th=32.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 9.276364827392964, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
