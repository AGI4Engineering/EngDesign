{'completion_tokens': 6420, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The task requires determining a suitable thickness (Th) for a steel cantilever beam to limit vertical displacement under a specific load. Key considerations include the beam's stiffness, which depends on the moment of inertia (I ∝ Th³). The load is a uniform pressure on the outer half of the beam, leading to complex deflection behavior. Using beam theory and deflection formulas for partial uniform loads, the deflection δ is approximated as δ ≈ 305,060 / Th³ mm. To achieve δ between 1.4 mm (70% of 2 mm) and 1.8 mm (90% of 2 mm), solving for Th yields a range of ~55–60 mm. A thickness of 58 mm is selected as a midpoint, balancing stiffness and geometric constraints while ensuring the displacement falls within the 70–90% scoring range.", config=ConfigFile(Th=58.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 1.561341945213519, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 100.0}
