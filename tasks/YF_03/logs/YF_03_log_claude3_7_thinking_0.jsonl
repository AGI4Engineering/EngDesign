Using beam theory, I derived that the maximum deflection follows the formula δ(L) = 30.5/Th³, where Th is the beam thickness in mm. For optimal scoring, the deflection needs to be between 70% and 90% of the 2mm threshold (1.4-1.8mm). This requires a thickness between 2.57mm and 2.79mm. I chose 2.7mm, which gives a deflection of approximately 1.55mm (77.5% of threshold), comfortably within the optimal range.', config=ConfigFile(Th=2.7)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 15341.847237533439, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
