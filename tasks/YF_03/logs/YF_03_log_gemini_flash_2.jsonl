A larger thickness will increase the beam's stiffness, thus reducing displacement. Given the length (L = 1000 mm) and width (w = 40 mm) of the beam, and the applied load, an initial thickness of 20 mm is chosen to provide sufficient stiffness. The cantilever beam deflection is roughly related to the cube of the thickness, so a good starting value is important for this design space. Also, increasing thickness increases stiffness which in turn reduces displacement. Selecting a value that brings us close to the allowable threshold would improve efficiency.", config=ConfigFile(Th=20.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 37.976202933596774, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
