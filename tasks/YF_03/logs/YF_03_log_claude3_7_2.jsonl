For a cantilever beam with length L=1000mm, width w=40mm, and load of 1000N applied over the outer half, I derived that the deflection δ = 297.6/Th³ mm. To achieve 70-90% of the allowable 2mm deflection (1.4-1.8mm), I calculated the required thickness to be between 5.5-6.0mm. I selected Th=5.8mm, which should place us in the optimal displacement range while accounting for the limitations of the beam theory approximation versus full 3D analysis.', config=ConfigFile(Th=5.8)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 1551.5700200122633, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
