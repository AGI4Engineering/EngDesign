{'completion_tokens': 3489, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A straightforward estimate can be made by treating the load on the half‐length (from x = 500 mm to x = 1000 mm) as a single equivalently concentrated load of about 1000 N acting at x = 750 mm from the fixed end. For a cantilever with load P at distance a < L, the vertical tip displacement can be approximated by d = (P·a²·(3L − a)) / (6 E I), where E is Young’s modulus and I is the second moment of area. For a rectangular cross section of width w = 40 mm and thickness Th in the vertical direction, I = (w·Th³)/12.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, one finds that to keep d < 2 mm, Th must be slightly above 53 mm. Choosing Th near 55–56 mm keeps the maximum displacement under 2 mm and within about 70%–90% of that limit, maximizing the scoring criterion. This ensures enough stiffness under the given uniform load while avoiding unnecessary material usage.\n', config=ConfigFile(Th=55.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 1.8304557995601396, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 84.7721002199302}
