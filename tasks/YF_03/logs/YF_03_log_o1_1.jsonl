{'completion_tokens': 3420, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A straightforward way to estimate the beam’s deflection is to approximate the uniform load (applied from L/2 to L) as an equivalent single load acting around the three-quarter point. The total downward force is about 1000\u202fN, and the beam’s moment of inertia is (w × Th³)/12, with “Th” in the vertical direction. A short-form cantilever deflection formula suggests that a thickness near 49\u202fmm keeps the maximum deflection in the 1.7\u202fmm range, which is safely below the 2\u202fmm limit and within the preferred 70–90% displacement ratio range, ensuring maximum score. This choice also balances structural efficiency by avoiding excessive material use while maintaining adequate stiffness.', config=ConfigFile(Th=49.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 2.5872755147268043, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
