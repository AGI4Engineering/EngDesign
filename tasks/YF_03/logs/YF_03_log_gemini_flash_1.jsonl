Given that the length (L) is 1000 mm and a uniform load is applied, I'll choose a thickness that provides adequate stiffness without being excessively large.\n\nA thicker beam will exhibit higher stiffness and lower displacement. Based on experience with similar cantilever beam problems, a thickness around 20 mm to 30 mm is likely to provide a displacement within the desired range. I will choose Th = 25mm as a starting point. This value provides a balance between stiffness and material usage.
