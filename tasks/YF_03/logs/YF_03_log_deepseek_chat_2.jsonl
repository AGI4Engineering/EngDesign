{'completion_tokens': 376, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To determine a suitable thickness (Th) for the steel cantilever beam, we need to ensure that the maximum vertical displacement (uy) is less than 2 mm under the given load. The beam is subjected to a uniform load over the outer half of its length, and we must balance stiffness and geometric constraints. \n\n1. **Load Calculation**: The uniform load magnitude is given as 1000/(L/2 * w) N/mm². Substituting L = 1000 mm and w = 40 mm, the load magnitude is 1000/(500 * 40) = 0.05 N/mm². This load is applied over the area from L/2 to L (500 mm to 1000 mm).\n\n2. **Stiffness Consideration**: The stiffness of the beam is primarily influenced by its thickness (Th). A thicker beam will have higher stiffness, reducing displacement, but it must not be excessively thick to avoid unnecessary material usage.\n\n3. **Displacement Constraint**: The maximum allowable displacement is 2 mm. To ensure the displacement is between 70% and 90% of this threshold (1.4 mm to 1.8 mm), we aim for a thickness that achieves this range. Based on typical cantilever beam deflection formulas and material properties, a thickness of 20 mm is a reasonable starting point. This value is chosen to provide sufficient stiffness while staying within geometric and material constraints.\n\n4. **Justification**: A thickness of 20 mm is likely to keep the displacement within the desired range (1.4 mm to 1.8 mm) given the load and beam dimensions. This choice balances performance and material efficiency.', config=ConfigFile(Th=20.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 37.976202933596774, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
