The magnitude of the load is 1000/(L/2 * w) N/mm², which simplifies to 1000/(500 * 40) = 0.05 N/mm².\n\n2. **Stiffness Requirement**: The beam must not deflect more than 2 mm under the given load. The stiffness of a cantilever beam is influenced by its thickness (Th), with thicker beams being stiffer and deflecting less.\n\n3. **Geometric Constraints**: The width (w) is fixed at 40 mm, so the thickness (Th) is the primary variable affecting the beam's moment of inertia and thus its stiffness.\n\n4. **Initial Estimate**: For a cantilever beam under a uniform load over half its length, the maximum deflection occurs at the free end. Using simplified beam theory, the deflection is proportional to (load * length^4) / (Young’s modulus * moment of inertia). For a rectangular cross-section, the moment of inertia is (w * Th³)/12.\n\n5. **Trial and Adjustment**: Starting with an initial guess (e.g., Th = 20 mm), we can iteratively adjust the thickness to ensure the deflection is within 70-90% of the allowable 2 mm (i.e., 1.4 to 1.8 mm). This range ensures full points (100) for the design.\n\n6. **Final Proposal**: Based on the above reasoning and typical engineering practice, a thickness of 25 mm is proposed. This value is likely to keep the deflection within the desired range while maintaining a reasonable and manufacturable thickness.", config=ConfigFile(Th=25.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 19.447323208326562, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 0.0}
