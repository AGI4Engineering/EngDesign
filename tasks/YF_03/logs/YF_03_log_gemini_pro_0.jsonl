{'completion_tokens': 1013, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The thickness `Th` is determined to ensure the maximum vertical displacement `uy` is within an optimal range (1.4 mm to 1.8 mm), which is 70% to 90% of the allowable 2 mm limit, to achieve a full score. The aim is for a deflection of approximately 1.6 mm (80% of the limit).\n\n1.  **Load Calculation**: The beam (L=1000mm, w=40mm) is subjected to a uniform pressure `P = 1000 N / ((L/2) * w) = 1000 N / (500 mm * 40 mm) = 1000 N / 20000 mm^2 = 0.05 N/mm^2`. This pressure acts on the width `w=40mm`, resulting in a uniformly distributed line load `q = P * w = 0.05 N/mm^2 * 40 mm = 2 N/mm`. This load is applied on the outer half of the top face, from `x = L/2 = 500 mm` to `x = L = 1000 mm` (measured from the fixed cantilever end).\n\n2.  **Deflection Formula**: Using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever for a UDL `q` applied from `x=a` to `x=L` can be found by superimposing two load cases: (deflection due to UDL from 0 to L) - (deflection due to UDL from 0 to a). With `a=L/2`, this simplifies to `delta_max = (41 * q * L^4) / (384 * E * I)`.\n    -   Young's Modulus, `E = 210,000 MPa = 210,000 N/mm^2`.\n    -   Second moment of area, `I = (w * Th^3) / 12 = (40 * Th^3) / 12 = (10/3) * Th^3 mm^4`.\n\n3.  **Substituting Values**: Plugging in the known values into the deflection formula:\n    `delta_max = (41 * 2 N/mm * (1000 mm)^4) / (384 * 210000 N/mm^2 * (10/3) * Th^3 mm^4)`\n    `delta_max = (82 * 10^12 N*mm^3) / (268,800,000 N/mm^2 * Th^3 mm^4)`\n    `delta_max = 305059.5238 / Th^3 mm` (coefficient has units mm^3).\n\n4.  **Solving for Th**: To achieve the target deflection `delta_target = 1.6 mm`:\n    `1.6 mm = 305059.5238 mm^3 / Th^3`\n    `Th^3 = 305059.5238 mm^3 / 1.6 mm = 190662.202 mm^3`\n    `Th = (190662.202)^(1/3) mm ≈ 57.55 mm`.\n\n5.  **Proposed Thickness**: A value of `Th = 57.5 mm` is proposed.\n    This thickness is expected to result in a deflection of `delta_max = 305059.5238 / (57.5)^3 ≈ 1.6046 mm`.\n    This corresponds to `1.6046 mm / 2 mm = 80.23%` of the allowable limit, which falls comfortably within the 70-90% range for maximum score.\n    This choice based on 1D beam theory provides a structurally sound estimate. It also offers some margin for potential variations when evaluated using a 3D structural simulation, which might account for effects like shear deformation (though estimated to be small for L/Th ≈ 17.4).", config=ConfigFile(Th=57.5)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 1.6022879573594788, 'threshold': 2.0}, 'score': 100.0}
