{'completion_tokens': 4704, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To estimate the car’s peak forward and peak negative accelerations, first we compare the maximum force available at the driven wheels (or from the brakes) with the grip limit from the tires. Based on the car’s mass (mcar = 728 kg) and the longitudinal grip coefficient (gripx = 1.15), the friction-limited force is simply:\n\nF_friction_limit = gripx × mcar × g\n                 = 1.15 × 728 × 9.81 ≈ 8200 N\n\nDividing that force by the car’s mass yields the highest effective (friction-limited) acceleration:\n\namax_friction = F_friction_limit / mcar\n              = 8200 / 728 ≈ 11.3 m/s²\n\nOn the engine side, taking the peak engine torque (430 Nm) in first gear (gear ratio ≈ 10.0) and including the final efficiency reff = 0.95, the force at the contact patch could be even larger than 8200 N—so traction (i.e., the tire grip limit) is the deciding factor if the car is on good asphalt.\n\nSimilarly, for maximum deceleration under braking, the total braking torque mbrk = 7000 Nm is large. Converting that to force at the contact patch:\n\nF_brake = mbrk / rtyre\n        = 7000 / 0.32 ≈ 21875 N\n\ngives a theoretical deceleration of ~30 m/s² if only the brakes were limiting. But again, grip ultimately caps the braking force to about 8200 N on level ground without much aerodynamic downforce at low speeds:\n\nadecel = F_friction_limit / mcar\n       = 8200 / 728 ≈ 11.3 m/s²\n\nHence, in SI units, both the maximum acceleration and deceleration are about 11.3 m/s².', config=ConfigFile(max_acc=11.3, max_dec=11.3)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Max_acceleration_differnce': 0.4853556113606654, 'Max_deceleration_difference': 20.296638164170872}, 'score': 0}
