{'completion_tokens': 395, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To compute the maximum possible acceleration and deceleration of the car, we need to analyze the forces acting on the car. For maximum acceleration, we consider the maximum engine torque and the grip available. For maximum deceleration, we consider the braking force and the grip available.\n\n1. **Maximum Acceleration (Task 1):**\n   - The maximum engine torque is 430 Nm (from EngNm array).\n   - The effective radius of the wheel (rtyre) is 0.32 m.\n   - The gear ratio (rGearRat) for the first gear is 10.0.\n   - The efficiency (reff) is 0.95.\n   - The force at the wheels is calculated as (Engine Torque * Gear Ratio * Efficiency) / Wheel Radius.\n   - The maximum acceleration is then this force divided by the mass of the car (mcar = 728 kg).\n   - Calculation: (430 * 10.0 * 0.95) / 0.32 = 12781.25 N. Then, 12781.25 / 728 ≈ 17.56 m/s².\n\n2. **Maximum Deceleration (Task 2):**\n   - The maximum braking torque (mbrk) is 7000 Nm.\n   - The braking force is the braking torque divided by the wheel radius (0.32 m).\n   - The maximum deceleration is this force divided by the mass of the car.\n   - Calculation: 7000 / 0.32 = 21875 N. Then, 21875 / 728 ≈ 30.05 m/s².', config=ConfigFile(max_acc=17.56, max_dec=30.05)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Max_acceleration_differnce': -5.774644388639333, 'Max_deceleration_difference': 1.5466381641708722}, 'score': 0}
