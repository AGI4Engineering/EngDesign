{'completion_tokens': 375, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To compute the maximum possible acceleration and deceleration, we need to analyze the given parameters of the car. \n\n**Task 1: Maximum Acceleration**\nThe maximum acceleration is determined by the maximum force the car can generate divided by its mass. The maximum force is derived from the engine torque and the effective gear ratio. \n1. From the `EngNm` and `EngRpm`, we can see the peak torque is 430 Nm at 7000 rpm.\n2. The effective gear ratio (`reff`) is 0.95, and the first gear ratio (`rGearRat[0]`) is 10.0.\n3. The force at the wheels is calculated as `(Engine Torque * Gear Ratio * reff) / rtyre`.\n4. The mass of the car (`mcar`) is 728 kg.\n5. Thus, max acceleration = `(430 * 10.0 * 0.95) / (0.32 * 728)` ≈ 17.5 m/s².\n\n**Task 2: Maximum Deceleration**\nThe maximum deceleration is determined by the braking force divided by the mass of the car.\n1. The maximum braking torque (`mbrk`) is 7000 Nm.\n2. The braking force is `mbrk / rtyre`.\n3. Thus, max deceleration = `7000 / (0.32 * 728)` ≈ 30.0 m/s².\n\nNote: These are theoretical maxima assuming perfect traction and no other losses.', config=ConfigFile(max_acc=17.5, max_dec=30.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Max_acceleration_differnce': -5.714644388639334, 'Max_deceleration_difference': 1.596638164170873}, 'score': 0}
