It is 430 Nm.\n    *   Multiply the maximum engine torque by the gear ratio (`rGearRat`), and transmission efficiency (`reff`) to obtain the torque at the wheel.  Since we want *maximum* acceleration, we want the gear that provides the *highest* wheel torque. The first gear has the highest ratio. 430*10*0.95 = 4085 Nm.  We will use first gear ratio (10.0) for the calculations since we are focusing on the *maximum* possible acceleration, and the first gear ratio is the largest.\n\n3.  **Calculate the force at the wheels:**\n    *   Divide the wheel torque by the tyre radius (`rtyre`).  4085/0.32 = 12765.625 N.\n\n4.  **Calculate the maximum acceleration:**\n    *   Divide the force at the wheels by the mass of the car (`mcar`).  12765.625/728 = 17.535 m/s^2\n\n**Task 2: Maximum Deceleration**\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant factors:**\n    *   `mbrk`: Maximum braking torque.\n    *   `rtyre`: Tyre radius.\n    *   `mcar`: Mass of the car.\n\n2.  **Calculate braking force:**\n    *   Divide the maximum braking torque by the tyre radius (`rtyre`). 7000/0.32= 21875 N\n\n3.  **Calculate maximum deceleration:**\n    *   Divide the braking force by the mass of the car (`mcar`).  21875/728 = 30.048 m/s^2\n\nTherefore the maximum acceleration is 17.535 m/s^2 and maximum deceleration is 30.048 m/s^2", config=ConfigFile(max_acc=17.535, max_dec=30.048)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Max_acceleration_differnce': -5.749644388639334, 'Max_deceleration_difference': 1.5486381641708746}, 'score': 0}
