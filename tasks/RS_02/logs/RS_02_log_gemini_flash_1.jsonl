Then, I'll calculate the maximum acceleration and deceleration based on those parameters. Finally, I'll structure the response in the required JSON format.\n\n**Step 1: Extract relevant parameters**\n\nmcar (car mass): 728 kg\nmbrk (braking force): 7000 N\ngripx (grip in x direction): 1.15\ngripy (grip in y direction): 1.40\nloadEff (load transfer efficiency): 0.10\n\n**Step 2: Calculate maximum acceleration**\n\nThe maximum acceleration is limited by the engine force. However, the engine details are provided using engine torque and RPM which is not easily translatable to accelaration without more information. Therefore, I will use a simplification using grip and gravity.\n\nAssuming acceleration is only constrained by grip then \n\nF_max = mcar * g * gripx = 728 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 * 1.15 = 8197.842 N\nMax_acc = F_max / mcar = 8197.842 N / 728 kg = 11.26 m/s^2\n\n**Step 3: Calculate maximum deceleration**\n\nMax_dec = mbrk / mcar = 7000 N / 728 kg = 9.62 m/s^2\n\n**Step 4: Construct the JSON response**\n\nI will now combine the results into the required JSON structure.", config=ConfigFile(max_acc=11.26, max_dec=9.62)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Max_acceleration_differnce': 0.5253556113606663, 'Max_deceleration_difference': 21.976638164170872}, 'score': 0}
