{'completion_tokens': 363, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To compute the maximum possible acceleration and deceleration, we need to consider the forces acting on the car. For maximum acceleration, we look at the engine torque and the grip available. For maximum deceleration, we consider the braking force and the grip.\n\nTask 1: Maximum Acceleration\n1. The maximum engine torque is 430 Nm (from EngNm array).\n2. The effective radius of the tire is 0.32 m (rtyre).\n3. The force at the tire is torque / radius = 430 / 0.32 = 1343.75 N.\n4. The car's mass is 728 kg (mcar).\n5. Maximum acceleration is force / mass = 1343.75 / 728 ≈ 1.846 m/s².\n\nTask 2: Maximum Deceleration\n1. The maximum braking torque is 7000 Nm (mbrk).\n2. The force at the tire is torque / radius = 7000 / 0.32 = 21875 N.\n3. The car's mass is 728 kg (mcar).\n4. Maximum deceleration is force / mass = 21875 / 728 ≈ 30.05 m/s².\n\nNote: The deceleration value seems unusually high, which might indicate that the braking torque (mbrk) is not in Nm but possibly in another unit or there's a misunderstanding in the setup file. However, based on the given data, this is the computed value.", config=ConfigFile(max_acc=1.846, max_dec=30.05)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Max_acceleration_differnce': 9.939355611360666, 'Max_deceleration_difference': 1.5466381641708722}, 'score': 0}
