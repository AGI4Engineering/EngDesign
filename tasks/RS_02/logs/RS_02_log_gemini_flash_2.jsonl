{'completion_tokens': 500, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="Okay, let's break this down into steps. \n\n**Task 1: Calculate Maximum Acceleration**\n\nTo calculate the maximum acceleration, we need to determine the maximum force the engine can provide at the wheels and then divide by the car's mass.  The engine force depends on the engine torque and gear ratios.\n\n1.  **Engine Torque Curve:** The `EngNm` and `EngRpm` arrays define the engine's torque curve. I will simplify by using the maximum torque which is 430 Nm.\n2.  **Gear Ratios:** `rGearRat` array gives the gear ratios. The best acceleration will be in first gear, so I'll use the first gear ratio, which is 10.0.\n3.  **Wheel Torque:** Wheel torque is engine torque times gear ratio times final drive ratio (`reff`).  So, wheel torque = 430 Nm * 10.0 * 0.95 = 4085 Nm.\n4.  **Wheel Force:** Wheel force is wheel torque divided by the tire radius (`rtyre`). Wheel force = 4085 Nm / 0.32 m = 12765.625 N.\n5.  **Maximum Acceleration:** Maximum acceleration is wheel force divided by car mass (`mcar`).  Maximum acceleration = 12765.625 N / 728 kg = 17.535 m/s^2.\n\n**Task 2: Calculate Maximum Deceleration**\n\nThe maximum deceleration is determined by the braking force and the car's mass.\n\n1.  **Braking Force:**  `mbrk` is the maximum braking force = 7000 N.\n2.  **Maximum Deceleration:** Maximum deceleration is braking force divided by car mass. Maximum deceleration = 7000 N / 728 kg = 9.615 m/s^2\n\nNow, let's format the results into the JSON structure.", config=ConfigFile(max_acc=17.535, max_dec=9.615)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Max_acceleration_differnce': -5.749644388639334, 'Max_deceleration_difference': 21.981638164170874}, 'score': 0}
