For a car, this force comes from the engine power transmitted to the wheels.\n\nFrom the parameters:\n- `mcar` = 728 kg (car mass)\n- `EngNm` = [200, 300, 430, 380] Nm (engine torque at different RPMs)\n- `EngRpm` = [0, 3000, 7000, 10000] RPM (engine RPM values)\n- `rGearRat` = [10.0, 7.8, 6.1, 7.8, 5.2, 4.5, 4.0] (gear ratios)\n- `rtyre` = 0.32 m (tire radius)\n- `reff` = 0.95 (efficiency ratio)\n- `gripx` = 1.15 (longitudinal grip coefficient)\n\nThe maximum torque from the engine is 430 Nm at 7000 RPM.\n\nTo get maximum acceleration, I need to:\n1. Determine the maximum force at wheels\n2. Check if this force exceeds grip limits\n3. Calculate the resulting acceleration\n\nThe maximum force at wheels would be using the highest gear ratio (1st gear = 10.0):\n\nForce = (Torque × Gear ratio × Efficiency) / Tire radius\nForce = (430 Nm × 10.0 × 0.95) / 0.32 m\nForce = 12,797.5 N\n\nHowever, there's a grip limit. The maximum grip force is:\nGrip force = Mass × Gravity × Grip coefficient\nGrip force = 728 kg × 9.81 m/s² × 1.15\nGrip force = 8,214.4 N\n\nSince the engine can produce more force than the tires can grip, we are grip-limited.\n\nTherefore, maximum acceleration = Grip force / Mass\nMaximum acceleration = 8,214.4 N / 728 kg = 11.28 m/s²\n\n# Task 2: Maximum Deceleration\n\nFor maximum deceleration, we need to consider the braking force and the grip limit.\n\nFrom the parameters:\n- `mbrk` = 7000 (brake torque in Nm)\n- `gripy` = 1.40 (lateral grip coefficient, which can apply to braking)\n\nThe maximum brake force would be:\nBrake force = Brake torque / Tire radius\nBrake force = 7000 Nm / 0.32 m\nBrake force = 21,875 N\n\nThe maximum grip force during braking would be:\nGrip force = Mass × Gravity × Grip coefficient\nGrip force = 728 kg × 9.81 m/s² × 1.40\nGrip force = 10,001.7 N\n\nSince the brakes can produce more force than the tires can grip, we are grip-limited during braking too.\n\nTherefore, maximum deceleration = Grip force / Mass\nMaximum deceleration = 10,001.7 N / 728 kg = 13.74 m/s²\n\nSo, the maximum acceleration is 11.28 m/s² and the maximum deceleration is 13.74 m/s².", config=ConfigFile(max_acc=11.28, max_dec=13.74)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Max_acceleration_differnce': 0.5053556113606668, 'Max_deceleration_difference': 17.856638164170874}, 'score': 0}
