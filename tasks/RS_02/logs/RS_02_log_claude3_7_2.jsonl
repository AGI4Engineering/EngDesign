Engine force (propulsion)\n2. Aerodynamic drag force (resistance)\n3. Tire grip limitations (maximum force that can be transferred)\n\nLooking at the provided parameters:\n- `mcar` = 728 kg (car mass)\n- `gripx` = 1.15 (longitudinal grip coefficient)\n- `rGearRat` = [10.0, 7.8, 6.1, 7.8, 5.2, 4.5, 4.0] (gear ratios)\n- `rtyre` = 0.32 m (tire radius)\n- `reff` = 0.95 (efficiency)\n- `EngNm` = [200, 300, 430, 380] Nm (engine torque at different RPMs)\n- `EngRpm` = [0, 3000, 7000, 10000] RPM (engine RPM points)\n\nThe maximum acceleration will occur at the point where we have the maximum tractive force at the wheels. This is typically at the maximum torque point of the engine, transmitted through the highest gear ratio.\n\nMaximum engine torque = 430 Nm (at 7000 RPM)\nHighest gear ratio = 10.0 (first gear)\nTire radius = 0.32 m\nEfficiency = 0.95\n\nMaximum wheel force = (Engine torque × Gear ratio × Efficiency) / Tire radius\nMaximum wheel force = (430 × 10.0 × 0.95) / 0.32 = 12,765.63 N\n\nHowever, this force is limited by tire grip:\nMaximum grip force = car mass × gripx × g\nMaximum grip force = 728 × 1.15 × 9.81 = 8,225.2 N\n\nSince the tire grip force is lower than the potential wheel force, the maximum acceleration is limited by tire grip.\n\nMaximum acceleration = Maximum grip force / car mass\nMaximum acceleration = 8,225.2 / 728 = 11.30 m/s²\n\n# Task 2: Compute maximum possible deceleration\n\nThe maximum deceleration is determined by:\n1. Braking force capability\n2. Tire grip limitations\n\nFrom the parameters:\n- `mcar` = 728 kg (car mass)\n- `mbrk` = 7000 (appears to be brake torque in Nm)\n- `gripx` = 1.15 (longitudinal grip coefficient)\n- `rtyre` = 0.32 m (tire radius)\n\nMaximum brake force at wheels = Brake torque / Tire radius\nMaximum brake force = 7000 / 0.32 = 21,875 N\n\nMaximum grip-limited force = car mass × gripx × g\nMaximum grip-limited force = 728 × 1.15 × 9.81 = 8,225.2 N\n\nSince the grip-limited force is lower than the brake force capability, the maximum deceleration is limited by tire grip.\n\nMaximum deceleration = Maximum grip force / car mass\nMaximum deceleration = 8,225.2 / 728 = 11.30 m/s²\n\nTherefore, the maximum acceleration is 11.30 m/s² and the maximum deceleration is 11.30 m/s².", config=ConfigFile(max_acc=11.3, max_dec=11.3)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Max_acceleration_differnce': 0.4853556113606654, 'Max_deceleration_difference': 20.296638164170872}, 'score': 0}
