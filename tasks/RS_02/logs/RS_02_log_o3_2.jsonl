This exceeds the tyre/road limit, so again the tyres limit performance.\n        Therefore the limiting force is the same μx · m · g, giving\n        a_dec = μx · g ≈ 11.28 m/s², acting in the opposite direction (deceleration).\n\nStep-4  Aerodynamic down-force and drag would raise the achievable values at higher speeds, but the question asks for the maximum attainable figures in general terms; the lowest-speed, traction-limited values are the definitive ones unless a full speed-dependent analysis is requested.\n\nResult:\n        Maximum acceleration  ≈ 11.3 m/s²\n        Maximum deceleration  ≈ 11.3 m/s² (magnitude)', config=ConfigFile(max_acc=11.3, max_dec=11.3)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Max_acceleration_differnce': 0.4853556113606654, 'Max_deceleration_difference': 20.296638164170872}, 'score': 0}
