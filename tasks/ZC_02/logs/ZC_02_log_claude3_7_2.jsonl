The key is to check if the transfer function G(z) = C(zI-A)⁻¹B + D stays strictly inside the disk centered at (1/2, 0) with radius 1/2 in the complex plane for |z| > 1.\n\nGiven system matrices:\nA = [0.5 0; 1.0 0], B = [1; 0], C = [2.0 0.92], D = [0]\n\nStep 1: Calculate the transfer function G(z).\nG(z) = C(zI-A)⁻¹B (since D = 0)\n\nCalculating (zI-A):\nzI-A = [z-0.5 0; -1 z]\n\nThe determinant is det(zI-A) = (z-0.5)z\n\nThe inverse is:\n(zI-A)⁻¹ = [z/(z-0.5)z, 0; 1/(z-0.5)z, 1/z] = [1/(z-0.5), 0; 1/((z-0.5)z), 1/z]\n\nTherefore:\nG(z) = C(zI-A)⁻¹B = [2.0 0.92] × [1/(z-0.5); 0] × [1] = 2.0/(z-0.5)\n\nStep 2: Apply the Circle Criterion\nFor the sector [0,1], I need to check if:\n1 + G(z) ≠ 0 for |z| ≥ 1\n\nSubstituting our transfer function:\n1 + G(z) = 1 + 2.0/(z-0.5) = (z-0.5 + 2.0)/(z-0.5) = (z+1.5)/(z-0.5)\n\nThis expression is non-zero for |z| ≥ 1 since the numerator and denominator cannot be zero simultaneously when |z| ≥ 1.\n\nStep 3: Find the maximum value of α\nWhen we include α, our transfer function becomes:\nG(z,α) = αC(zI-A)⁻¹B = α×2.0/(z-0.5) = 2.0α/(z-0.5)\n\nFor the circle criterion in sector [0,1], we need:\n|G(e^jω,α) + 1/2| < 1/2 for all ω ∈ [0,π]\n\nThis means:\n|2.0α/(e^jω-0.5) + 1/2| < 1/2\n\nCalculating the maximum value where this inequality holds:\nAt ω = π (z = -1), we have the most critical point:\nG(-1,α) = 2.0α/(-1-0.5) = -2.0α/1.5 = -4α/3\n\nThe circle criterion requires:\n|-4α/3 + 1/2| < 1/2\n\nThis means -1/2 < -4α/3 + 1/2 < 1/2\nSo -1 < -4α/3 < 0\n3/4 > α > 0\n\nTherefore, α_max = 3/4 = 0.75.\n\nFor verification, we can also use the discrete-time Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma or directly check the system's eigenvalues with the maximum α value to confirm stability.", config=ConfigFile(alpha=0.75)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'alpha': 0.75}, 'score': 95.0}
