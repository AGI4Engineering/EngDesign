The problem involves a discrete-time Lurye feedback system with a linear time-invariant block and a nonlinear block.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the System Dynamics:**\n   - The system is described by the state-space equations:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{cases}\n       x_{k+1} = A x_k + \\alpha B w_k,\\\\\n       y_k = C x_k + D w_k,\n     \\end{cases}\n     \\]\n     where \\( w_k = \\phi(v_k) \\) and \\( v_k = d_k - y_k \\).\n   - The nonlinearity \\( \\phi \\) satisfies the sector condition: \\( 0 \\le \\frac{\\phi(v_1) - \\phi(v_2)}{v_1 - v_2} \\le 1 \\) for all \\( v_1 \\neq v_2 \\).\n\n2. **Formulate the Stability Condition:**\n   - The closed-loop system is absolutely stable if there exists a Lyapunov function \\( V(x) = x^T P x \\) with \\( P > 0 \\) such that the discrete-time Lyapunov inequality holds for all \\( \\phi \\) in the sector.\n   - The Lyapunov inequality for absolute stability in the sector \\( [0, 1] \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n       A^T P A - P & A^T P B \\\\\n       B^T P A & B^T P B - \\alpha^{-1} I\n     \\end{bmatrix} < 0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Use Semidefinite Programming (SDP):**\n   - The above inequality can be checked using SDP. We need to find the maximum \\( \\alpha \\) such that the inequality holds.\n   - This involves solving an optimization problem where \\( P \\) is a positive definite matrix and \\( \\alpha \\) is maximized.\n\n4. **Bisection Method:**\n   - Since the problem is non-convex in \\( \\alpha \\), we can use a bisection method to find the maximum \\( \\alpha \\).\n   - Start with an initial range for \\( \\alpha \\), say \\( [0, \\alpha_{max}] \\), and iteratively narrow down the range by checking the feasibility of the SDP for the midpoint of the range.\n\n5. **Numerical Values:**\n   - Given matrices are:\n     \\[\n     A = \\begin{bmatrix}0.5 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix},\n     B = \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix},\n     C = \\begin{bmatrix}2 & 0.92\\end{bmatrix},\n     D = [0].\n     \\]\n   - Use these matrices in the SDP formulation and perform the bisection to find \\( \\alpha_{max} \\).\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the maximum \\( \\alpha \\) for which the system remains absolutely stable.', config=ConfigFile(alpha=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'alpha': 0.5}, 'score': 70.0}
