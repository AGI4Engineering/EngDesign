{'completion_tokens': 944, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To improve the edge detection performance, I need to tune the parameters of the membership functions (sx, sy, wa, wb, wc, ba, bb, bc) to achieve:\n- MSE < 0.5\n- PSNR > 3 dB\n- SSIM > 0.05\n\nLet me first understand the role of each parameter:\n\n1. sx and sy: These are the standard deviations for the Gaussian membership functions for inputs Ix and Iy. Smaller values will make the membership function narrower, meaning the system will be more sensitive to small gradient changes.\n\n2. wa, wb, wc: These define the triangular membership function for the "white" output, which corresponds to non-edge regions.\n\n3. ba, bb, bc: These define the triangular membership function for the "black" output, which corresponds to edge regions.\n\nBased on the baseline code, the current parameters are:\n- sx = 0.01, sy = 0.01 (sensitivity to gradients)\n- wa = 0.5, wb = 0.5, wc = 1 (white/non-edge regions)\n- ba = 0.5, bb = 0.5, bc = 0.7 (black/edge regions)\n\nLooking at the current performance metrics:\n- MSE: 0.5958 (need to reduce below 0.5)\n- PSNR: 2.25 dB (need to increase above 3 dB)\n- SSIM: 0.0366 (need to increase above 0.05)\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\n1. For sx and sy:\n   - The current values are quite small (0.01). This means the system is already quite sensitive to gradients.\n   - Increasing them slightly might reduce false positives by making the system less sensitive to small noise gradients.\n   - I\'ll increase both to 0.015 to reduce sensitivity slightly.\n\n2. For the white membership function (wa, wb, wc):\n   - Currently (0.5, 0.5, 1) creates a right triangle.\n   - I\'ll adjust to (0.3, 0.45, 0.6) to create a more balanced triangle at lower intensity values.\n   - This will make non-edge regions appear more distinctly white (lower values).\n\n3. For the black membership function (ba, bb, bc):\n   - Currently (0.5, 0.5, 0.7) creates a right triangle.\n   - I\'ll change to (0.6, 0.75, 0.9) to shift the triangle toward higher intensity values.\n   - This will make edges appear more distinctly black (higher values).\n\nThis tuning approach aims to:\n- Reduce false edge detections (by increasing sx, sy)\n- Create better separation between edge and non-edge regions (by adjusting the membership functions)\n- Increase contrast between edges and non-edges (by separating the white and black membership functions)\n\nAfter analysis of the image structure, I believe these parameter adjustments will help improve all three metrics (MSE, PSNR, and SSIM) by creating clearer edge delineation and reducing noise in the edge detection output.\n\nMy final tuned parameters are:\n- sx = 0.015\n- sy = 0.015\n- wa = 0.3\n- wb = 0.45\n- wc = 0.6\n- ba = 0.6\n- bb = 0.75\n- bc = 0.9', config=ConfigFile(sx=0.015, sy=0.015, wa=0.3, wb=0.45, wc=0.6, ba=0.6, bb=0.75, bc=0.9)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'mse': 0.24773871383027773, 'psnr': 6.060061214355407, 'ssim': -0.051974003386260695, 'mse_pass': True, 'psnr_pass': False, 'ssim_pass': False, 'score': 30.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 30.0}
