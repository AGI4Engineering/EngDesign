First, sx and sy control the width of the Gaussian membership function for the input gradients Ix and Iy. These define how much of a gradient is considered "zero" (not an edge). Smaller values make the system more sensitive to small gradients, detecting more edges.\n\n2. The parameters wa, wb, wc define the triangular membership function for the "white" (non-edge) output. In the baseline, wa=wb=0.5 and wc=1 creates a right triangle that starts at 1 at x=0.5 and decreases to 0 at x=1.\n\n3. The parameters ba, bb, bc define the triangular membership function for the "black" (edge) output. In the baseline, ba=bb=0.5 and bc=0.7 creates a right triangle that starts at 1 at x=0.5 and decreases to 0 at x=0.7.\n\nTo improve performance, I need to make the system more sensitive to edges while maintaining good discrimination between edges and non-edges:\n\n- By reducing sx and sy, I\'ll make the system more sensitive to gradients, helping to detect more true edges and improve all metrics.\n\n- For the output membership functions, I\'ll adjust them to create better separation. By reducing ba and bb, the black function will cover more of the output range. By increasing bc, I\'ll make the black function less steep, allowing for more nuanced edge detection. I\'ll also reduce wc to make the white function less dominant.\n\nThese changes should help reduce MSE by detecting more true edges, increase PSNR by improving the signal-to-noise ratio, and increase SSIM by improving the structural similarity with the Canny edge detector reference.', config=ConfigFile(sx=0.007, sy=0.007, wa=0.5, wb=0.5, wc=0.8, ba=0.4, bb=0.4, bc=0.9)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'mse': 0.7644303875708945, 'psnr': 1.1666205723705343, 'ssim': 0.013014151963277756, 'mse_pass': False, 'psnr_pass': False, 'ssim_pass': False, 'score': 0.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 0.0}
