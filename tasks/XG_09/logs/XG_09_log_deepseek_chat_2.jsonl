{'completion_tokens': 655, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To improve the edge detection performance, we need to tune the parameters of the membership functions (sx, sy, wa, wb, wc, ba, bb, bc) to achieve the desired metrics (MSE < 0.5, PSNR > 3 dB, SSIM > 0.05). Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Parameters**:\n   - `sx` and `sy` control the spread of the Gaussian membership functions for the inputs `Ix` and `Iy`. A smaller value makes the function more sensitive to small changes, which is useful for detecting edges.\n   - `wa`, `wb`, `wc` define the triangular membership function for the 'white' output, representing uniform regions.\n   - `ba`, `bb`, `bc` define the triangular membership function for the 'black' output, representing edges.\n\n2. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The baseline values (sx=0.01, sy=0.01) are quite sensitive, which might lead to detecting noise as edges.\n   - The 'white' and 'black' membership functions are overlapping, which might reduce the distinction between edges and uniform regions.\n\n3. **Tuning Strategy**:\n   - Increase `sx` and `sy` slightly to reduce sensitivity to noise while still detecting edges.\n   - Adjust the 'white' and 'black' membership functions to reduce overlap and improve distinction.\n   - Ensure that the 'black' function is more aggressive in detecting edges by shifting its parameters.\n\n4. **Parameter Adjustments**:\n   - `sx` and `sy`: Increased to 0.02 to reduce noise sensitivity.\n   - `wa`, `wb`, `wc`: Adjusted to 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 to narrow the 'white' region.\n   - `ba`, `bb`, `bc`: Adjusted to 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 to shift the 'black' region towards higher intensities.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - Reduced MSE due to fewer false edges.\n   - Increased PSNR and SSIM due to better edge detection and less noise.\n\n6. **Final Parameters**:\n   - sx: 0.02\n   - sy: 0.02\n   - wa: 0.4\n   - wb: 0.5\n   - wc: 0.6\n   - ba: 0.6\n   - bb: 0.7\n   - bc: 0.8", config=ConfigFile(sx=0.02, sy=0.02, wa=0.4, wb=0.5, wc=0.6, ba=0.6, bb=0.7, bc=0.8)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'mse': 0.2912736854116593, 'psnr': 5.356987491407099, 'ssim': -0.06568478540033025, 'mse_pass': True, 'psnr_pass': False, 'ssim_pass': False, 'score': 30.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 30.0}
