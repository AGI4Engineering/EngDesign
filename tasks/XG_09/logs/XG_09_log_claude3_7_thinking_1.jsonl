Looking at the baseline metrics (MSE: 0.5958, PSNR: 2.25 dB, SSIM: 0.0366), I can see there\'s room for improvement.\n\nFirst, let me analyze what each parameter does:\n\n1. sx/sy: Standard deviations for the Gaussian membership functions for Ix and Iy. These control how sensitive the detector is to gradients.\n   - Smaller values: More sensitive to small changes (detecting more edges, including noise)\n   - Larger values: Less sensitive to small changes (detecting fewer, more significant edges)\n\n2. wa/wb/wc: Define the triangular membership function for "white" (non-edge pixels)\n   - The baseline uses [0.5, 0.5, 1.0], creating a right-angled triangle\n\n3. ba/bb/bc: Define the triangular membership function for "black" (edge pixels)\n   - The baseline uses [0.5, 0.5, 0.7], creating a narrow right-angled triangle\n\nI notice that in the baseline, there\'s significant overlap at 0.5 between white and black, creating ambiguity. Also, having wa=wb and ba=bb creates suboptimal triangular functions.\n\nI\'ll make these adjustments:\n\n1. Increase sx and sy to reduce sensitivity to small gradients, which should help filter out noise\n2. Create proper triangular membership functions with distinct points\n3. Establish better separation between white and black membership functions\n\nFor sx/sy: I\'ll double them from 0.01 to 0.02 to focus on more significant edges\n\nFor white membership: I\'ll use [0.0, 0.3, 0.6] to create a proper triangle focused on lower values\n\nFor black membership: I\'ll use [0.4, 0.7, 1.0] to create a proper triangle focused on higher values\n\nThis creates minimal overlap (0.4-0.6) between white and black, which allows for some fuzzy transition while still maintaining clear distinction between edges and non-edges.\n\nThese changes should make the detector less sensitive to small gradients (reducing false edges), improve the separation between edge and non-edge regions, and result in better alignment with the Canny edge detector used as ground truth.', config=ConfigFile(sx=0.02, sy=0.02, wa=0.0, wb=0.3, wc=0.6, ba=0.4, bb=0.7, bc=1.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'mse': 0.2946487699339445, 'psnr': 5.306953676080839, 'ssim': -0.06500411224260753, 'mse_pass': True, 'psnr_pass': False, 'ssim_pass': False, 'score': 30.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 30.0}
