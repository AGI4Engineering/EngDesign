{'completion_tokens': 845, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To tune the parameters for better edge detection performance, I need to understand how each parameter affects the fuzzy logic system:\n\n1. `sx` and `sy`: These are the standard deviations for the Gaussian membership functions for inputs Ix and Iy. Smaller values make the system more sensitive to small changes in intensity gradients.\n\n2. `wa`, `wb`, `wc`: These define the triangular membership function for "white" edges (non-edges).\n\n3. `ba`, `bb`, `bc`: These define the triangular membership function for "black" edges (edge pixels).\n\nLet\'s analyze the current parameters and how they might be improved:\n\nCurrent parameters:\n- sx = 0.01, sy = 0.01 (Gaussian MF parameters for inputs)\n- wa = 0.5, wb = 0.5, wc = 1 (triangle MF for white/non-edge)\n- ba = 0.5, bb = 0.5, bc = 0.7 (triangle MF for black/edge)\n\nWith these parameters, the performance metrics are:\n- MSE: 0.5958\n- PSNR: 2.25 dB\n- SSIM: 0.0366\n\nWe need to improve to:\n- MSE < 0.5\n- PSNR > 3 dB\n- SSIM > 0.05\n\nLooking at the image data, I can see it has moderate contrast and various edge structures. Here\'s my approach to tuning the parameters:\n\n1. For `sx` and `sy`:\n   - Decreasing these values will make the system more sensitive to small gradients, potentially detecting more edges\n   - I\'ll try values around 0.005-0.008 to increase sensitivity without being too noisy\n\n2. For white membership function (`wa`, `wb`, `wc`):\n   - The current triangle starts at 0.5 and ends at 1.0\n   - I\'ll adjust these to make non-edges more clearly defined\n   - Trying values that start a bit lower to increase contrast\n\n3. For black membership function (`ba`, `bb`, `bc`):\n   - The current range is quite narrow (0.5 to 0.7)\n   - I\'ll widen this range to better differentiate edges\n\nLet me try these parameter adjustments:\n- sx = 0.007, sy = 0.007 (increase sensitivity to gradients)\n- wa = 0.3, wb = 0.4, wc = 0.8 (redefine white/non-edge range)\n- ba = 0.4, bb = 0.6, bc = 0.9 (widen the edge detection range)\n\nThis configuration should:\n1. Increase sensitivity to edges with the reduced sx/sy values\n2. Create more contrast between edge and non-edge regions\n3. Provide a broader range for edge classification\n\nThese adjustments should help improve all three metrics by creating cleaner edges and reducing noise in uniform regions, effectively lowering MSE, increasing PSNR, and improving structural similarity (SSIM).', config=ConfigFile(sx=0.007, sy=0.007, wa=0.3, wb=0.4, wc=0.8, ba=0.4, bb=0.6, bc=0.9)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'mse': 0.17219916299971333, 'psnr': 7.639689638317789, 'ssim': 0.0023331962119228075, 'mse_pass': True, 'psnr_pass': False, 'ssim_pass': False, 'score': 30.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 30.0}
