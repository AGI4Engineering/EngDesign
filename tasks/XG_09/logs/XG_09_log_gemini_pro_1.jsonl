{'completion_tokens': 1258, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The baseline fuzzy edge detection system has an MSE of 0.5958, PSNR of 2.25 dB, and SSIM of 0.0366. The goal is to improve these metrics to MSE < 0.5, PSNR > 3 dB, and SSIM > 0.05 by tuning the membership function parameters `sx, sy, wa, wb, wc, ba, bb, bc`.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Baseline Output Membership Functions (Iout):**\n    The primary reason for poor baseline performance lies in the parameters for the output membership functions (`wa, wb, wc` for 'white' and `ba, bb, bc` for 'black').\n    -   'white' MF: `wa = 0.5, wb = 0.5, wc = 1`. This defines a triangular membership function `trimf(Iout, [0.5, 0.5, 1.0])`. It is 1 at `Iout = 0.5` and 0 at `Iout = 1.0`. The centroid of this MF is approximately 0.667.\n    -   'black' MF: `ba = 0.5, bb = 0.5, bc = 0.7`. This defines `trimf(Iout, [0.5, 0.5, 0.7])`. It is 1 at `Iout = 0.5` and 0 at `Iout = 0.7`. The centroid of this MF is approximately 0.567.\n    This setup has critical issues:\n    *   **Inverted Logic:** Non-edge regions ('white') are assigned a higher output value (~0.667) than edge regions ('black', ~0.567). Typically, edges are represented by higher values (e.g., 1) and non-edges by lower values (e.g., 0).\n    *   **Poor Contrast:** The output values for 'white' and 'black' are very close (0.667 and 0.567), leading to a low-contrast edge map.\n    *   **Misalignment with Ground Truth:** Canny edge maps (pseudo-ground-truth) are typically binary (0 for non-edge, 1 for edge). The baseline outputs are far from this, leading to high MSE.\n\n2.  **Proposed Output Membership Function Parameters:**\n    To address these issues, the output MFs should be redefined so that 'white' (no edge) corresponds to an output near 0 and 'black' (edge) corresponds to an output near 1.\n    -   For 'white' (no edge): `wa = 0.0, wb = 0.0, wc = 0.2`. This `trimf(Iout, [0.0, 0.0, 0.2])` peaks at `Iout = 0` and extends to `Iout = 0.2`. The centroid is ~0.067.\n    -   For 'black' (edge): `ba = 0.8, bb = 1.0, bc = 1.0`. This `trimf(Iout, [0.8, 1.0, 1.0])` peaks at `Iout = 1` and starts from `Iout = 0.8`. The centroid is ~0.933.\n    These changes will produce a high-contrast edge map with values aligned with a typical 0/1 ground truth representation.\n\n3.  **Proposed Input Membership Function Parameters (Ix, Iy):**\n    The baseline parameters `sx = 0.01` and `sy = 0.01` define very narrow Gaussian MFs for 'zero' gradient. This makes the system highly sensitive to small changes in intensity, potentially classifying noise as edges.\n    The Canny edge detector is generally robust and aims to identify significant edges. To make the fuzzy system behave more like Canny (less sensitive to minor variations), the 'zero' MFs should be wider. This can be achieved by increasing `sx` and `sy`.\n    -   Proposed `sx = 0.1`\n    -   Proposed `sy = 0.1`\n    These larger values will make the system require a more substantial gradient to classify a pixel as 'not zero' (and thus an edge), potentially reducing noise and false positives.\n\n4.  **Expected Outcome:**\n    With the proposed parameters:\n    -   The output edge map will have clear distinctions between edges (near 1) and non-edges (near 0).\n    -   MSE is expected to decrease significantly because the output values will be much closer to the binary ground truth values.\n    -   PSNR, being inversely related to MSE (`PSNR = -10 * log10(MSE)` for MAX_I=1), will increase substantially.\n    -   SSIM should improve as the structural content of the fuzzy edge map will more closely resemble the cleaner, Canny-like edges.\n    These changes are anticipated to meet the target performance metrics: MSE < 0.5, PSNR > 3 dB, and SSIM > 0.05.", config=ConfigFile(sx=0.1, sy=0.1, wa=0.0, wb=0.0, wc=0.2, ba=0.8, bb=1.0, bc=1.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'mse': 0.5905444582509468, 'psnr': 2.2874740161310916, 'ssim': -0.08244812330092481, 'mse_pass': False, 'psnr_pass': False, 'ssim_pass': False, 'score': 0.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 0.0}
