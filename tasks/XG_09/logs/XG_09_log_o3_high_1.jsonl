{'completion_tokens': 1401, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Baseline performance was poor largely because the rule base produced low (dark) output values when a pixel was judged to be an edge, i.e. the consequents were semantically inverted with respect to the binary edge-map expected from Canny (edges should be bright / 1, background dark / 0).  \n\nStep-by-step tuning that yields the required improvements:\n1. Broaden the Gaussian MFs for Ix and Iy (sx, sy).  The original very narrow σ=0.01 labelled virtually every non-zero gradient as “non-zero”, so a great deal of noise was classified as edge.  Setting σ≈0.02–0.03 keeps genuine step changes flagged, while treating small texture and sensor noise as uniform area.\n2. Invert the output semantics by swapping the numerical locations (but not the names) of the ‘white’ and ‘black’ triangular MFs.  We simply move the ‘black’ triangle to peak at 1 and the ‘white’ triangle to peak at 0.  The rule base stays unchanged; its consequents now yield bright values for edges.\n3. Make the two output triangles narrow and well separated ([0 0 0.3] for background and [0.7 1 1] for edges).  This reduces fuzziness in the final binary image and improves PSNR and SSIM with respect to the crisp Canny map.\n\nWith these parameters the fuzzy system generates an almost binary edge map: thin bright contours on a dark background.
