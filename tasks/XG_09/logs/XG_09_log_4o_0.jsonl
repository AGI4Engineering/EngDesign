{'completion_tokens': 437, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To improve the edge detection performance using fuzzy logic, we need to adjust the parameters of the membership functions for the inputs (Ix, Iy) and the output (Iout). The goal is to achieve MSE < 0.5, PSNR > 3 dB, and SSIM > 0.05. The baseline parameters are: sx = 0.01, sy = 0.01 for the Gaussian membership functions of Ix and Iy, and wa = 0.5, wb = 0.5, wc = 1, ba = 0.5, bb = 0.5, bc = 0.7 for the triangular membership functions of Iout. \n\nTo achieve better performance, we can try the following adjustments:\n1. Increase the spread of the Gaussian membership functions (sx, sy) to make them less sensitive to small intensity differences, which might help in reducing false edges due to noise.\n2. Adjust the parameters of the triangular membership functions (wa, wb, wc, ba, bb, bc) to better distinguish between edge and non-edge regions. This can be done by increasing the range of the 'white' membership function and decreasing the range of the 'black' membership function to make the system more sensitive to actual edges.\n\nLet's try the following new parameters:\n- sx = 0.02, sy = 0.02: This increases the spread of the Gaussian functions, making them less sensitive to noise.\n- wa = 0.4, wb = 0.6, wc = 1.0: This adjusts the 'white' membership function to be more inclusive.\n- ba = 0.4, bb = 0.6, bc = 0.8: This adjusts the 'black' membership function to be more exclusive, focusing on stronger edges.", config=ConfigFile(sx=0.02, sy=0.02, wa=0.4, wb=0.6, wc=1.0, ba=0.4, bb=0.6, bc=0.8)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'mse': 0.44040240324641877, 'psnr': 3.5615031977791913, 'ssim': 0.06492049868068464, 'mse_pass': True, 'psnr_pass': False, 'ssim_pass': False, 'score': 30.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 30.0}
