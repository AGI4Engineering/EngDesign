{'completion_tokens': 1635, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Below is an example of updated parameters for the input Gaussian membership functions on Ix and Iy, as well as the triangular membership functions for the output (Iout). The idea is to slightly broaden the Gaussian widths (sx and sy) so that very small differences in neighboring pixels are more likely to be considered as part of a smooth (white) region rather than an edge, and to adjust the output membership functions so that transitions to black (edge) are more selective. These adjustments often help reduce false positives and improve alignment with the Canny-derived pseudo ground truth, thereby helping you meet the specified MSE, PSNR, and SSIM targets.\n\nProposed parameter set:\n• sx = 0.05\n• sy = 0.05\n• wa = 0.2\n• wb = 0.4\n• wc = 0.6\n• ba = 0.5\n• bb = 0.75\n• bc = 1.0\n\nNote that these are example values; real tuning may require further iterations, but these suggested parameters should serve as a sound starting point to achieve MSE < 0.5, PSNR > 3 dB, and SSIM > 0.05.', config=ConfigFile(sx=0.05, sy=0.05, wa=0.2, wb=0.4, wc=0.6, ba=0.5, bb=0.75, bc=1.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'mse': 0.4416539557831685, 'psnr': 3.549178753434417, 'ssim': -0.08743031868250942, 'mse_pass': True, 'psnr_pass': False, 'ssim_pass': False, 'score': 30.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 30.0}
