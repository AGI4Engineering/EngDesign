The baseline parameters (sx=0.01, sy=0.01, wa=0.5, wb=0.5, wc=1, ba=0.5, bb=0.5, bc=0.7) achieve MSE: 0.5958, PSNR: 2.25 dB, SSIM: 0.0366. Our goal is MSE < 0.5, PSNR > 3 dB, SSIM > 0.05. We adjust the parameters as follows:\n\n1. **sx and sy**: These control the spread of the Gaussian membership functions for Ix and Iy. Increasing them makes the membership functions broader, allowing more pixels to be considered as part of an edge. We set sx=0.02 and sy=0.02.\n\n2. **wa, wb, wc**: These define the triangular membership function for 'white' (uniform region). We adjust them to wa=0.4, wb=0.5, wc=0.6 to make the uniform region membership stricter.\n\n3. **ba, bb, bc**: These define the triangular membership function for 'black' (edge). We adjust them to ba=0.4, bb=0.6, bc=0.8 to make the edge membership more inclusive.\n\nThese adjustments should better differentiate between edges and uniform regions, improving the metrics.", config=ConfigFile(sx=0.02, sy=0.02, wa=0.4, wb=0.5, wc=0.6, ba=0.4, bb=0.6, bc=0.8)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'mse': 0.21275710583508872, 'psnr': 6.7211592608035335, 'ssim': -0.03204645588477713, 'mse_pass': True, 'psnr_pass': False, 'ssim_pass': False, 'score': 30.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 30.0}
