{'completion_tokens': 910, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To improve the edge detection performance, I need to tune the parameters of the membership functions to achieve the desired metrics: MSE < 0.5, PSNR > 3 dB, and SSIM > 0.05.\n\nThe baseline code uses these parameters:\n- sx = 0.01 (parameter for the membership function Ix)\n- sy = 0.01 (parameter for the membership function Iy)\n- wa = 0.5, wb = 0.5, wc = 1 (parameters for the "white" membership function Iout)\n- ba = 0.5, bb = 0.5, bc = 0.7 (parameters for the "black" membership function Iout)\n\nThe current performance metrics are:\n- MSE: 0.5958\n- PSNR: 2.25 dB\n- SSIM: 0.0366\n\nLet me analyze how each parameter affects the edge detection:\n\n1. sx and sy: These parameters control the width of the Gaussian membership function for inputs Ix and Iy. Smaller values make the "zero" membership function narrower, meaning fewer pixels will be classified as belonging to a uniform region (not an edge). Larger values make it wider, leading to more pixels being classified as not edges.\n\n2. wa, wb, wc: These define the triangular membership function for "white" for output Iout. White corresponds to non-edge pixels.\n\n3. ba, bb, bc: These define the triangular membership function for "black" for output Iout. Black corresponds to edge pixels.\n\nBased on the metrics, we need to improve edge detection by making adjustments:\n\nFor sx and sy:\n- Increasing these values would make the "zero" membership function wider, meaning more pixels would be considered uniform (not edges).\n- This could help reduce false edge detections and improve our metrics.\n\nFor the output membership functions:\n- Adjusting these parameters affects how the input gradients are mapped to the output intensity.\n- Fine-tuning the triangular membership functions for both "white" and "black" can help create clearer edges.\n\nBased on my analysis of the image (which shows clear structural elements but somewhat noisy content), I\'ll try the following parameter changes:\n\n1. Increase sx and sy slightly to reduce false edge detections (from 0.01 to 0.025)\n2. Adjust the "white" membership function (wa, wb, wc) to better differentiate non-edges\n3. Adjust the "black" membership function (ba, bb, bc) to make edge detections more precise\n\nMy parameter choices:\n- sx = 0.025 (increased from 0.01)\n- sy = 0.025 (increased from 0.01)\n- wa = 0.3 (reduced from 0.5)\n- wb = 0.4 (reduced from 0.5)\n- wc = 0.9 (reduced from 1.0)\n- ba = 0.6 (increased from 0.5)\n- bb = 0.7 (increased from 0.5)\n- bc = 0.85 (increased from 0.7)\n\nThe increased sx and sy values should help reduce false edges, while the adjusted output membership functions should better differentiate between edges and non-edges. The shifted "black" membership function should create more pronounced edges where actual boundaries exist.', config=ConfigFile(sx=0.025, sy=0.025, wa=0.3, wb=0.4, wc=0.9, ba=0.6, bb=0.7, bc=0.85)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'mse': 0.4660108068856297, 'psnr': 3.3160401181563297, 'ssim': -0.07695394588603806, 'mse_pass': True, 'psnr_pass': False, 'ssim_pass': False, 'score': 30.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 30.0}
