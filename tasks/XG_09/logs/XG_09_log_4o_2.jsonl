{'completion_tokens': 500, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To improve the edge detection performance using fuzzy logic, we need to adjust the parameters of the membership functions. The baseline code uses Gaussian membership functions for the inputs (Ix and Iy) and triangular membership functions for the output (Iout). The parameters to be tuned are sx, sy for the Gaussian functions, and wa, wb, wc, ba, bb, bc for the triangular functions. The goal is to achieve MSE < 0.5, PSNR > 3 dB, and SSIM > 0.05.\n\n1. **Understanding the Parameters:**\n   - `sx` and `sy` are the standard deviations for the Gaussian membership functions for Ix and Iy. Smaller values make the function more sensitive to small changes in intensity, which can help in detecting edges more accurately.\n   - `wa`, `wb`, `wc` define the triangular membership function for the 'white' output, which represents non-edges.\n   - `ba`, `bb`, `bc` define the triangular membership function for the 'black' output, which represents edges.\n\n2. **Strategy for Tuning:**\n   - Decrease `sx` and `sy` slightly to make the system more sensitive to intensity changes, which can help in better edge detection.\n   - Adjust `wa`, `wb`, `wc` to ensure that non-edges are correctly classified as 'white'.\n   - Adjust `ba`, `bb`, `bc` to ensure that edges are correctly classified as 'black'.\n\n3. **Proposed Values:**\n   - `sx = 0.005`, `sy = 0.005`: Decreasing these values to increase sensitivity.\n   - `wa = 0.4`, `wb = 0.5`, `wc = 0.9`: Adjusting to better classify non-edges.\n   - `ba = 0.6`, `bb = 0.7`, `bc = 0.8`: Adjusting to better classify edges.\n\nBy implementing these changes, we aim to improve the edge detection performance and meet the specified evaluation metrics.", config=ConfigFile(sx=0.005, sy=0.005, wa=0.4, wb=0.5, wc=0.9, ba=0.6, bb=0.7, bc=0.8)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'mse': 0.17887591805006067, 'psnr': 7.47448124284281, 'ssim': 0.006868161161478613, 'mse_pass': True, 'psnr_pass': False, 'ssim_pass': False, 'score': 30.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 30.0}
