In this task, you will be given a set of 2D points.

## Task Description
You are given a list of (x, y) pairs that roughly follow a quadratic (second-order) polynomial relationship, but include some noise.

Your task is to estimate the best-fit second-order polynomial function of the form:
    y = a * x^2 + b * x + c

where:
- a, b, c are real-valued coefficients.

You must provide the estimated coefficients (a, b, c) and minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the fit.

## Output Format
You must provide the following:

### coefficients
    a
    b
    c

## Data points:
x = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]
y = [7.9, 2.0, 0.1, 2.2, 6.0, 12.1]
