Build the design matrix for a quadratic model: each row is [x_i^2, x_i, 1].\n3. Form the normal-equation system (X^T X)·[a b c]^T = X^T y.\n   • Σx   = 3,  Σx² = 19,  Σx³ = 27,  Σx⁴ = 115\n   • Σy   = 30.3, Σxy = 32.7, Σx²y = 168.7\n   • The 3×3 normal matrix and RHS vector are:\n        [115  27  19] [a]   [168.7]\n        [ 27  19   3] [b] = [ 32.7]\n        [ 19   3   6] [c]   [ 30.3]\n4. Solve the system exactly (Gaussian elimination on integer-scaled equations):\n   • Convert to integers by multiplying every equation by 10 to avoid decimals.\n   • After elimination, two reduced equations in b and c are obtained:\n        8b − 3c = −984/175\n        168b − 329c = −1396/5\n   • Solving gives:  c = 106/175 ≈ 0.6057142857,  b = −333/700 ≈ −0.4757142857.\n   • Substitute back to get a:  a = 207/140 ≈ 1.4785714286.\n5. The fitted quadratic is therefore y ≈ 1.47857 x² − 0.47571 x + 0.60571.\n6.
