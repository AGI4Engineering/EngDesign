Task: Estimate coefficients a, b, c for a quadratic polynomial y = a * x^2 + b * x + c that best fits the given (x, y) data points by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n\n2. Method: This is a linear least squares regression problem. We aim to find the coefficient vector β = [a, b, c]^T that minimizes the squared Euclidean norm of the residual vector ||Y - Xβ||^2. The solution is given by the normal equation: β = (X^T * X)^(-1) * X^T * Y.\n\n3. Data Points:\nx = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]\ny = [7.9, 2.0, 0.1, 2.2, 6.0, 12.1]\n\n4. Matrix Formulation:\nFor each data point (x_i, y_i), the model is y_i ≈ a * x_i^2 + b * x_i + c.\nThis can be written in matrix form Y ≈ Xβ.\nThe design matrix X is constructed with rows [x_i^2, x_i, 1]:\nX = [[(-2)^2, -2, 1],    [[ 4, -2, 1],\n     [(-1)^2, -1, 1],     [ 1, -1, 1],\n     [( 0)^2,  0, 1],  =  [ 0,  0, 1],\n     [( 1)^2,  1, 1],     [ 1,  1, 1],\n     [( 2)^2,  2, 1],     [ 4,  2, 1],\n     [( 3)^2,  3, 1]]     [ 9,  3, 1]]\n\nThe observation vector Y is:\nY = [[7.9],\n     [2.0],\n     [0.1],\n     [2.2],\n     [6.0],\n     [12.1]]\n\n5. Solving for Coefficients:\nThe coefficients β = [a, b, c]^T are determined by solving the normal equations. This involves calculating X^T*X, X^T*Y, then (X^T*X)^(-1), and finally β = (X^T*X)^(-1) * X^T*Y. Numerically, this is robustly solved using computational libraries (e.g., `numpy.linalg.lstsq` in Python which often uses SVD or QR decomposition).\n\nIntermediate calculations yield:\nX^T*X = [[115,  27, 19],\n         [ 27,  19,  3],\n         [ 19,   3,  6]]\n\nX^T*Y = [[168.7],\n         [ 32.7],\n         [ 30.3]]\n\nSolving the system (X^T*X)β = X^T*Y for β = [a, b, c]^T yields the estimated coefficients:\na ≈ 1.478571428571428\nb ≈ -0.4757142857142853\nc ≈ 0.6057142857142884\n\nThese coefficients define the quadratic polynomial that best fits the provided data points in the least squares sense.', config=ConfigFile(a=1.478571428571428, b=-0.4757142857142853, c=0.6057142857142884)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'Coefficient a is correct': np.True_, 'Coefficient b is correct': np.True_, 'Coefficient c is correct': np.True_, 'Errors in the fit are within acceptable limits': np.True_}, 'score': 100}
