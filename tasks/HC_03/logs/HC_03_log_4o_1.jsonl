The goal is to find the coefficients a, b, and c that minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted y values and the actual y values.\n\nThe given data points are:\n- x = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]\n- y = [7.9, 2.0, 0.1, 2.2, 6.0, 12.1]\n\nWe will use the method of least squares to fit a quadratic polynomial of the form:\n    y = a * x^2 + b * x + c\n\nSteps:\n1. Set up the design matrix X for the quadratic model, where each row corresponds to a data point and has the form [x^2, x, 1].\n2. Use the normal equation to solve for the coefficients: (X^T * X) * [a, b, c]^T = X^T * y\n3.
