{"completion_tokens": 833, "response": "reasoning='1. **Total Refresh Frequency:** Each of the 4 digits needs to be refreshed at 60Hz. Therefore, the total refresh frequency is 4 * 60Hz = 240Hz.\\n2. **Division Ratio:** The FPGA clock frequency is 50 MHz. To achieve a 240Hz refresh rate, the division ratio is 50,000,000 / 240 = 208333.33. Since we need an integer, we round up to 208334.\\n3. **Minimum Counter Bits:** We need to find the smallest integer `n` such that `2^n >= 208334`. `2^17 = 131072` and `2^18 = 262144`. Therefore, `n = 18`.\\n4. **Digit Select Bits:** We need two bits to select one of the four digits. The bits should cycle through all four possible values: 00, 01, 10, and 11.  We select the two most significant counter bits, i.e. counter[16:15], as illustrated in the provided SystemVerilog example.\\n5. **Digit Bit Selection Justification:** Selecting consecutive bits ensures that each digit is displayed for roughly the same duration, thereby enabling smooth cycling between the 4 digits.\\n6. **Maximum Delay Calculation:**\\n   * Nominal refresh period: 1 / 240Hz = 4.16666667 ms.\\n   * Clock frequency variation: 50 MHz * 0.0001 = 5 kHz. So, frequency can vary between 49.995 MHz and 50.005 MHz.\\n   * Worst-case refresh rate: 50.005 MHz / 208334 = 240.0287 Hz (approximately). Refresh period = 1 / 240.0287 Hz = 4.16616 ms\\n   * Best-case refresh rate: 49.995 MHz / 208334 = 239.9713Hz (approximately). Refresh period = 1 / 239.9713 Hz = 4.16757 ms\\n   * Additional delay: 5 clock cycles. At 49.995 MHz, 5 clock cycles take 5 / 49.995 MHz = 100.01 microseconds (0.0001 s = 0.1ms). The worst case delay from one refresh of the same digit to the next is then approximately 4 * 4.16757 +0.1 = 16.77 ms.\\n7. **Flicker Determination:**  The maximum delay (16.77 ms) is less than 33.33 ms (the threshold for 30Hz flicker).
