{'completion_tokens': 3057, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. We have 4 digits, each must refresh ≥60 Hz. Using time‐division multiplexing, we cycle through 4 digits sequentially. To give each digit 60 Hz, we need a cycle rate = 4 × 60 Hz = 240 Hz.\n2. With a 50 MHz clock, division_ratio = 50 000 000 Hz / 240 Hz ≈ 208 333.33, so we choose an integer ratio of 208 333 (yielding a multiplex rate ≈240.00 Hz).\n3. Find minimum n such that 2^n ≥ 208 333. 2^17=131 072<208 333, 2^18=262 144≥208 333 ⇒ n=18 bits.\n4. We need two bits from the free‐running 18‐bit counter to cycle through 4 states. The two most significant bits [17:16] will naturally count 00,01,10,11 cyclically as the counter increments.\n5. Reasoning: Bits [17:16] toggle at a rate of clock/(2^(17)) and clock/(2^(16)), producing evenly spaced 4‐phase selection and maximizing display dwell time uniformity.\n6. The base period between repeats of the same digit = 1/240 Hz ≈4.1667 ms. Accounting for ±100 ppm clock tolerance: 4.1667 ms×(1+0.0001)≈4.1671 ms, plus up to 5 cycles of logic delay (5/50 MHz =0.1 µs≈0.0001 ms), total ≈4.1672 ms.\n7. 4.17 ms ≪33.33 ms (30 Hz flicker threshold), so perceptible flicker is not possible.\n', config=ConfigFile(counter_bits=18, division_ratio=208333, digit_select_bits=[17, 16], bit_select_reasoning='Selecting the two MSBs of the 18-bit free-running counter yields a natural 4-state binary cycle (00→01→10→11) at equal time intervals, ensuring uniform multiplex phases without extra comparator logic.', max_delay_ms=4.1672, is_flicker_possible=False, mitigation_strategy='None required; refresh period well below flicker threshold.')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'counter_bits': '18 bits is within acceptable engineering range (17-19)', 'division_ratio': '208333 is within ±1000 of 208333', 'digit_select_bits': '[17, 16] are valid consecutive high-order bits', 'max_delay': 'Maximum delay calculation of 4.1672ms is incorrect', 'flicker_assessment': 'Incorrect assessment of flicker possibility'}, 'score': 80}
