These two bits cycle through 00,01,10,11 while the counter counts.  The length of one complete 4-state cycle is 2¹⁷ clock ticks, therefore\nF_cycle = 50 MHz / 2¹⁷ ≈ 381.47 Hz  → per-digit refresh ≈381 Hz.\n\nStep-5  (Why bits 16 & 15, not the top two bits)\nIf we had taken bits 17 & 16 the cycle frequency would be 50 MHz/2¹⁸ ≈190.7 Hz, which is **below** the 240 Hz total-cycle requirement calculated in step-1.  Bits 16 & 15 yield a comfortable safety margin while still allowing an 18-bit counter (bit 17 is simply not used for multiplexing).\n\nStep-6  (Worst-case delay between two activations of the same digit)\nNominal cycle period:  T_nom = 2¹⁷ / 50 MHz = 131 072 / 50 000 000 ≈ 2.62144 ms.  \nSlowest clock (-100 ppm):  Fmin = 50 MHz ×(1-0.0001)=49 995 000 Hz ⇒ T_slow ≈ 2.62144 ms /0.9999 ≈ 2.62170 ms.  \nAdd logic latency of 5 clock cycles at Fmin: 5 / 49 995 000 ≈ 100.01 ns = 0.000100 ms.  \nMax_delay = 2.62170 ms + 0.000100 ms ≈ 2.62180 ms.\n\nStep-7  (Flicker check)\n30 Hz flicker threshold means a period of 33.33 ms.
