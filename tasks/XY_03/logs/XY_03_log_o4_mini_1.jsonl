{'completion_tokens': 1733, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Total refresh frequency: Each of the four digits must refresh at least 60 Hz to avoid flicker, so the time‐division multiplexing scan rate must be 4 × 60 Hz = 240 Hz.\n2. Division ratio: To generate a 240 Hz strobe from a 50 MHz clock we need 50,000,000 Hz / 240 Hz ≃ 208,333.33. Since a counter can only count integer cycles, we choose a division_ratio of 208,333 clock ticks per full scan cycle.\n3. Counter bits: We need the smallest n such that 2^n ≥ 208,333. 2^17 = 131,072 is too small; 2^18 = 262,144 covers 208,333. So counter_bits = 18.\n4. Digit‐select bits: To divide the full scan period into four equal time slots we can use the two most significant bits of an 18-bit binary counter, namely counter[17] and counter[16]. These bits cycle through 00, 01, 10, 11 once every 2^18 counts, yielding four evenly spaced intervals.\n5. Bit selection justification: The MSBs toggle at one-quarter and one-half of the full count period, giving four equal subdivisions of the scan period with no additional logic.\n6. Maximum delay between successive refreshes of the same digit: The ideal period is 1/240 Hz = 4.166667 ms. Accounting for a worst‐case slow clock tolerance of +100 ppm increases this by 0.01% to 4.167083 ms. Adding up to 5 extra clock cycles of logic delay (5 × 20 ns = 0.1 μs) gives ≃ 4.167183 ms.\n7. Flicker check: The worst‐case 4.167 ms is well below the 33.33 ms threshold for visible flicker at 30 Hz.
