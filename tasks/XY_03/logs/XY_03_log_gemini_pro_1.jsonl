{"completion_tokens": 940, "response": "reasoning='1. **Total Refresh Frequency:** Each of the 4 digits needs to be refreshed at 60Hz, so the total refresh frequency is 4 * 60Hz = 240Hz.\\n2. **Division Ratio:** The FPGA clock is 50 MHz (50,000,000 Hz).  To get a refresh frequency of 240 Hz, the division ratio is 50,000,000 / 240 = 208333.33. Since we must use an integer divider, we should round to the nearest integer, giving 208333.\\n3. **Counter Bits:** We need to find the smallest integer `n` such that `2^n >= 208333`.  `2^17 = 131072` and `2^18 = 262144`. Therefore, we need 18 counter bits.\\n4. **Digit Select Bits:** To select one of the 4 digits, we need 2 bits. Bits [16:15] are selected from the counter for digit selection. This allows for easy indexing and ensures that each digit gets refreshed in turn.  The hex_driver example uses these bits.\\n5. **Bit Select Justification:** Using the most significant bits of the counter ensures that each digit is displayed for approximately the same amount of time. Using lower order bits would create a rapidly changing display which is not desired.\\n6. **Maximum Delay Calculation:**\\n    *   Nominal Refresh Period: 1/240 Hz = 4.16666667 ms.\\n    *   Clock Tolerance: 100 ppm = 0.0001. Frequency variation = 50 MHz * 0.0001 = 5000 Hz.  The clock can vary from 49.995 MHz to 50.005 MHz.\\n        Refresh Rate variation will be (Clock Frequency / Division Ratio).\\n        At 49.995Mhz, refresh is (49.995 * 10^6) / 208333  = 239.9756 Hz. Period = 4.16708ms\\n        At 50.005Mhz, refresh is (50.005 * 10^6) / 208333 = 240.0244 Hz. Period = 4.16625ms\\n    *   Worst-case refresh period = 4.16708 ms.\\n    *   Additional Delay: 5 clock cycles = 5 / 49.995MHz = 0.00000010001 * 5  seconds or 0.0000010001 seconds or 0.0010001 ms.\\n    *   Total Max Delay = 4.16708 + 0.0010001 = 4.1680801ms.\\n7. **Flicker Check:**  The maximum delay between refreshes of the same digit is 4.1680801 ms.  The flicker threshold is 33.33 ms (1/30 Hz).
