We will use exact code judgment to evaluate the correctness of LLM responses.

The evaluation will verify:
1. The accuracy of the counter bit calculations including division ratio
2. The correctness of the maximum delay calculations
3. The mathematical reasoning and formulas used
4, The Maximum delay calculation accuracy: 10 points
5. The Correct flicker assessment: 10 points

The evaluation will use a Python script to compare the LLM's calculated values against the correct solutions and award points according to the rubric.
