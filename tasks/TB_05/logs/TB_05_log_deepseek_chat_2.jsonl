{"completion_tokens": 667, "response": "reasoning='To design a Common-Source amplifier with a resistive load that meets the given specifications, we need to carefully select the parameters for the NMOS transistor (W1, L1, M1), the resistor (R0, M0), and the voltage source (V0). The key steps are as follows:\\n\\n1. **DC Gain Calculation**: The DC gain of a common-source amplifier with resistive load is given by -gm * RL, where gm is the transconductance of the NMOS transistor and RL is the load resistance. The target gain is -5 V/V, so we need to ensure gm * RL = 5.\\n\\n2. **Transconductance (gm)**: gm depends on the NMOS dimensions (W1, L1, M1) and the bias current. We need to choose W1 and L1 such that the transistor operates in saturation and provides the required gm.\\n\\n3. **Load Resistor (RL)**: RL is chosen to set the gain. Given gm, RL is calculated as RL = 5 / gm.\\n\\n4. **Bias Voltage (V0)**: The bias voltage VGS sets the operating point of the NMOS transistor. We need to ensure that the output voltage is 900 mV, which implies a certain drain current (ID) through RL. V0 is adjusted to achieve this ID.\\n\\n5. **Bandwidth**: The 3 dB bandwidth is determined by the output pole, which is 1/(RL * CL). Given CL = 2 pF, RL must be chosen such that the bandwidth is \u2265 50 Mrad/s (\u2248 8 MHz).\\n\\n6. **Parameter Selection**: After calculations, we choose W1 = 10u, L1 = 0.18u, M1 = 1, R0 = 1k, M0 = 1, and V0 = 0.9V to meet all specifications.' config=ConfigFile(netlist='// Library name: MP1\\n// Cell name: cs_amp\\n// View name: schematic\\nsubckt cs_amp VDD VSS vin_a vin_b vout\\n    NO (vout vin_a VSS VSS) tsmc18dN w=10u l=0.18u as=10u * 2.5 * (180.0n) ad=10u * 2.5 * (180.0n) \\\\\\n         ps=(2 * 10u) + (5 * (180.0n)) pd=(2 * 10u) + (5 * (180.0n)) m=1 \\\\\\n        region=sat\\n    V0 (vin_b VSS) vsource type=dc dc=0.9\\n    R0 (VDD vout) resistor r=1k m=1\\nends cs_amp\\n// End of subcircuit definition.\\n\\n// Library name: MP1\\n// Cell name: dut\\n// View name: schematic\\nI0 (net1 net2 net3 net4 net5) cs_amp')", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"metrics": {"dc_gain_vv": 3.369, "bw_mrads": 609.164, "vout_mv": 0.637}, "sub_scores": {"dc_gain": 0, "bandwidth": 35, "vout": 0}, "score": 35, "passed": false}, "score": 35}
