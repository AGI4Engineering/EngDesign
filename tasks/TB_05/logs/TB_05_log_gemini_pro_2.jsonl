{"completion_tokens": 2280, "response": "reasoning='The user wants a JSON output containing a Spectre netlist for a common-source amplifier. I need to determine the values for placeholders W1, L1M, M1 (for NMOS N0), R0, M0 (for resistor R0), and V0 (for voltage source V0) based on the provided specifications and template.\\n\\nDesign Steps & Calculations:\\n1.  **Specifications Review**:\\n    *   VDD = 1.8 V, CL = 2 pF.\\n    *   DC Gain (Av) = -5 V/V \u00b1 2%.\\n    *   3 dB Bandwidth (\u03c9_3dB) \u2265 50 Mrad/s.\\n    *   Output DC Voltage (Vout_DC) = 900 mV \u00b1 2%.\\n    *   NMOS model: tsmc18dN.\\n    *   Testbench: Unity-gain feedback (Vout to inverting input vin_a). This implies V_GS,Q = V_in,DC = V_out,DC.\\n\\n2.  **Operating Point (V_GS,Q and V_out,DC)**:\\n    *   From unity-gain feedback and Vout_DC spec: V_GS,Q = V_out,DC = 0.9 V.\\n    *   The NMOS N0 (vout vin_a VSS VSS) must be in saturation. V_DS,Q = V_out,DC = 0.9 V. V_GS,Q = 0.9 V. Assuming Vth_N ~ 0.4-0.5V, V_DS,Q > V_GS,Q - Vth_N (0.9 > 0.9 - Vth_N), so saturation is satisfied if Vth_N > 0.\\n\\n3.  **Load Resistor (R0) and Drain Current (I_D,Q)**:\\n    *   From bandwidth spec: \u03c9_3dB = 1/(R_out * C_L) \u2265 50 Mrad/s. Assuming R_out primarily determined by R_L (R0).\\n    *   R0 \u2264 1 / (50 Mrad/s * 2 pF) = 1 / (50e6 * 2e-12) = 1 / 100e-6 = 10 k\u2126.\\n    *   To meet the minimum BW, we choose R0 = 10 k\u2126. (Placeholder R0 value = 10k, M0 = 1).\\n    *   Drain current I_D,Q = (VDD - V_out,DC) / R0 = (1.8 V - 0.9 V) / 10 k\u2126 = 0.9 V / 10 k\u2126 = 90 \u00b5A.\\n\\n4.  **Transconductance (gm) and NMOS Sizing (W1, L1M, M1)**:\\n    *   The DC gain is Av = -gm * R_out. R_out = R0 || r_o (output resistance of N0).\\n    *   To estimate r_o, we need to choose a length L. Let\\'s choose L (placeholder L1M) = 0.36u (twice Lmin for better r_o than Lmin=0.18u).\\n    *   For L = 0.36u, typical Early voltage V_A could be around 3-4V. E.g. if V_A = 3.6V, r_o = V_A / I_D,Q = 3.6 V / 90 \u00b5A = 40 k\u2126.\\n    *   R_out = 10k || 40k = (10*40)/(10+40) = 400/50 = 8 k\u2126.\\n    *   With R_out = 8 k\u2126, the required gm = |Av| / R_out = 5 / 8 k\u2126 = 0.625 mS = 625 \u00b5S.\\n    *   The bandwidth with this R_out is \u03c9_3dB = 1 / (8 k\u2126 * 2 pF) = 1 / (16 ns) = 62.5 Mrad/s, which is \u2265 50 Mrad/s.\\n    *   Overdrive voltage V_OV = V_GS,Q - Vth_N. Also, gm = 2 * I_D,Q / V_OV.\\n    *   V_OV = (2 * 90 \u00b5A) / 625 \u00b5S = 180 / 625 = 0.288 V.\\n    *   Assuming typical k\\'_n (\u00b5n*Cox) for tsmc18dN is ~250 \u00b5A/V^2.\\n    *   I_D,Q = 0.5 * k\\'_n * (W/L) * V_OV^2.\\n    *   W/L = (2 * I_D,Q) / (k\\'_n * V_OV^2) = (2 * 90\u00b5) / (250\u00b5 * (0.288)^2) = 180 / (250 * 0.082944) = 180 / 20.736 \u2248 8.68.\\n    *   With L = 0.36 \u00b5m (placeholder L1M), W = 8.68 * 0.36 \u00b5m \u2248 3.1248 \u00b5m. Rounding to 3.13 \u00b5m.\\n    *   So, placeholder W1 = 3.13u, L1M = 0.36u, M1 = 1.\\n\\n5.  **Voltage Source (V0)**:\\n    *   The template includes `V0 (vin_b VSS) vsource type=dc dc=V0`.\\n    *   The problem description mentions \"an ideal voltage source VGS\". This likely refers to the V0 parameter.\\n    *   The V_GS,Q of the amplifying transistor N0 is 0.9V. So, set placeholder V0 = 0.9.\\n\\n6.  **Netlist Construction**:\\n    *   The template from the problem description is followed. Placeholders W1, L1M, M1, R0, M0, V0 are replaced with derived values.\\n    *   The `l=L1M` syntax in the template means L1M is the placeholder for length.\\n    *   Expressions for `as`, `ad`, `ps`, `pd` are maintained, with W1 replaced by its value.\\n    *   Indentation and line continuations (`\\\\`) are preserved as per the template.\\n    *   The comment `// End of subcircuit definition.` is omitted based on the strict formatting rules provided in the JSON schema description (points 1-5 for netlist structure), which takes precedence over the raw template snippet\\'s content regarding this specific comment line.\\n\\n7.  **Port Usage Constraint**:\\n    *   The rule \"Ensure that VDD VSS vin_a vin_b vout are explicitly used in the transistor gate connections... as they are differential inputs\" is problematic for a CS amplifier using the given template. Only `vin_a` is a gate connection for N0. `VSS` is its bulk connection. All ports (VDD, VSS, vin_a, vin_b, vout) are used in the subcircuit. The interpretation is that the template and CS amplifier type are the primary constraints, and the rule might be a remnant from a different problem type (e.g., differential amplifier).\\n\\nFinal values for placeholders:\\n*   W1: \"3.13u\"\\n*   L1M: \"0.36u\"\\n*   M1: \"1\"\\n*   R0: \"10k\"\\n*   M0: \"1\"\\n*   V0 (for dc voltage): \"0.9\"\\n' config=ConfigFile(netlist='// Library name: MP1\\n// Cell name: cs_amp\\n// View name: schematic\\nsubckt cs_amp VDD VSS vin_a vin_b vout\\n    NO (vout vin_a VSS VSS) tsmc18dN w=3.13u l=0.36u as=3.13u * 2.5 * (180.0n) ad=3.13u * 2.5 * (180.0n) \\\\\\n         ps=(2 * 3.13u) + (5 * (180.0n)) pd=(2 * 3.13u) + (5 * (180.0n)) m=1 \\\\\\n        region=sat\\n    V0 (vin_b VSS) vsource type=dc dc=0.9\\n    R0 (VDD vout) resistor r=10k m=1\\nends cs_amp\\n// Library name: MP1\\n// Cell name: dut\\n// View name: schematic\\nI0 (net1 net2 net3 net4 net5) cs_amp')", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"metrics": {"dc_gain_vv": 1.192, "bw_mrads": 210.842, "vout_mv": 0.223}, "sub_scores": {"dc_gain": 0, "bandwidth": 35, "vout": 0}, "score": 35, "passed": false}, "score": 35}
