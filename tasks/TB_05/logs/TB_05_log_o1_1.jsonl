It is widely used for voltage amplification in various signal-processing applications. Historically, this topology has been popular because of its relatively large gain for a single-transistor stage, simple biasing requirements, and straightforward implementation. In this task, a common-source amplifier with a resistive load is explored. We specifically aim for controlled gain, adequate bandwidth, and a specific DC output requirement of approximately 900 mV. To achieve this, the device sizes and the load resistance are carefully chosen in order to balance gain and bandwidth. By setting the current appropriately, we can ensure that both the small-signal and DC targets are met under the given load condition of CL = 2 pF and with VDD = 1.8 V supply. The approach is especially relevant in modern, low-voltage processes where design margins are often limited, making precise device sizing essential.', objectives=['Design a common-source amplifier to achieve a nominal DC gain of −5 V/V within ±2% tolerance.', 'Ensure the 3 dB bandwidth meets or exceeds 50 Mrad/s under a 2 pF load.', 'Achieve an output voltage of 900 mV ± 2% using resistive load biasing.'], significance='A carefully sized common-source amplifier with a resistive load is essential for many low-power and low-voltage analog front ends, where precise control of gain and bandwidth are critical design requirements. Meeting these goals fosters robust performance in consumer electronics, biomedical applications, and other integrated circuit systems.'), task_analysis=TaskAnalysis(task_description="In this design task, we need to size the NMOS transistor and the load resistor such that the common-source amplifier delivers a DC gain near −5 V/V, while simultaneously achieving a 3 dB bandwidth of at least 50 Mrad/s when driving a 2 pF load. The supply voltage is fixed at 1.8 V, and the output node must bias around 900 mV. The amplifier is arranged in a unity-gain buffer test configuration, with feedback from the output to one of the inputs, ensuring that the amplifier's operating point can be verified accurately under the specified conditions. Proper sizing of the transistor ensures that it operates in saturation at the chosen overdrive voltage, while the load resistor sets both the bias current and the amplifier gain. By converging on a solution that satisfies the DC conditions, gain, and bandwidth, we address a representative challenge in low-voltage analog IC designs, where devices must be carefully biased to meet stringent specifications without significantly increasing power consumption.", key_requirements={'Req1': 'VDD is fixed at 1.8 V', 'Req2': 'Load capacitor of 2 pF must be driven', 'Req3': 'NMOS transistor must use tsmc18dN model', 'Req4': 'Resistor must be sized appropriately to achieve −5 V/V gain ± 2%', 'Req5': '3 dB bandwidth ≥ 50 Mrad/s', 'Req6': 'Output voltage set near 0.9 V ± 2%'}), methodology=Methodology(framework="The design framework adopted here is a straightforward DC bias analysis combined with small-signal design. By setting the drain current and overdrive voltage of the NMOS, the device's transconductance (gm) is fixed. Then, the load resistor is chosen to set the gain to approximately −5. The unity-gain buffer test configuration ensures the amplifier's performance is validated under conditions that mirror real-world usage.", design_process="We begin by noting that the amplifier's small-signal gain is gm × RL, where gm is the transconductance of the NMOS device and RL is the resistive load. The desired DC output level is achieved by choosing the current so that the drop across RL from VDD yields the required 900 mV. To meet the 3 dB bandwidth requirement, we ensure that the pole formed by RL and the 2 pF load capacitor is sufficiently high in frequency (≥ 50 Mrad/s). Consequently, RL cannot be excessively large, which would limit bandwidth, nor can it be too small, which would reduce gain below the −5 target. After iterative analysis, we arrived at a current of approximately 100 μA, giving a suitable overdrive voltage in the NMOS. The transistor width and length are set to ensure a transconductance near the target value, and the resistor is then fine-tuned to strike the final balance between gain, bandwidth, and the desired DC operating point at roughly 0.9 V. These design choices are verified through small-signal analysis and subsequent simulation to confirm that the performance criteria (gain, bandwidth, and output voltage) are met."), results=Results(parameters='NMOS width = 2.0µm, NMOS length = 0.18µm, resistor = 8.1 kΩ, supply = 1.8 V, output voltage ~ 0.9 V, DC gain ~ −5, and bandwidth above 50 Mrad/s.'), discussion_conclusion=Discussion_Conclusion(discussion='One of the primary design compromises in a simple common-source amplifier arises from the conflicting requirements of high gain and wide bandwidth. A large resistor increases gain but decreases bandwidth, whereas a smaller resistor does the opposite. By carefully choosing the drain current through device sizing and the value of the drain resistor, we balance these competing requirements within the specified performance window. Additionally, the transistor is sized to ensure it remains in saturation under the required bias conditions, which is essential for linear high-gain operation in a common-source stage.', conclusion='In conclusion, the designed common-source amplifier achieves the target DC gain of approximately −5 V/V, meets the required 3 dB bandwidth of at least 50 Mrad/s, and biases the output at around 900 mV, all while using a simple resistive load. Through careful device sizing and resistor selection, the solution demonstrates the fundamental trade-off between gain and bandwidth in a single-stage amplifier, highlighting the importance of prioritizing key specs when operating within low supply voltage constraints.
