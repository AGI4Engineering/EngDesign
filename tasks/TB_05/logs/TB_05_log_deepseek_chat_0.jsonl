{"completion_tokens": 453, "response": "reasoning='To design a Common-Source amplifier with a resistive load, we need to meet the specifications for DC gain, bandwidth, and output voltage. The DC gain is given by -gm * RL, where gm is the transconductance of the NMOS transistor and RL is the load resistor. The 3 dB bandwidth is determined by the RC time constant at the output node, which includes the load resistor RL and the load capacitance CL. The output voltage is set by the DC bias point, which depends on the gate-source voltage VGS and the drain current through the NMOS transistor. We will adjust the width (W1), length (L1), and multiplier (M1) of the NMOS transistor, the resistance (R0) and multiplier (M0) of the load resistor, and the DC voltage (V0) of the ideal voltage source to meet the specifications.' config=ConfigFile(netlist='// Library name: MP1\\n// Cell name: cs_amp\\n// View name: schematic\\nsubckt cs_amp VDD VSS vin_a vin_b vout\\n    NO (vout vin_a VSS VSS) tsmc18dN w=3.0u l=0.18u as=3.0u * 2.5 * (180.0n) ad=3.0u * 2.5 * (180.0n) \\\\\\n         ps=(2 * 3.0u) + (5 * (180.0n)) pd=(2 * 3.0u) + (5 * (180.0n)) m=1 \\\\\\n        region=sat\\n    V0 (vin_b VSS) vsource type=dc dc=0.9\\n    R0 (VDD vout) resistor r=1.0k m=1\\nends cs_amp\\n// End of subcircuit definition.\\n\\n// Library name: MP1\\n// Cell name: dut\\n// View name: schematic\\nI0 (net1 net2 net3 net4 net5) cs_amp')", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"metrics": {"dc_gain_vv": 1.289, "bw_mrads": 525.612, "vout_mv": 1.394}, "sub_scores": {"dc_gain": 0, "bandwidth": 35, "vout": 0}, "score": 35, "passed": false}, "score": 35}
