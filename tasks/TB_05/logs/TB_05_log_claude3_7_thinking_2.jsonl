The resistor value directly impacts both gain and bandwidth - a higher resistance increases gain but reduces bandwidth. I chose 1.5 kΩ as a balanced value that meets the bandwidth requirement while allowing the desired gain to be achieved with reasonable transistor sizing.\n\nThe transistor sizing focuses on achieving the correct transconductance while maintaining operation in the saturation region. The relatively large width-to-length ratio of approximately 31 ensures sufficient transconductance while keeping the overdrive voltage at a moderate level of 0.36V.\n\nThe bias voltage V0 is critical for establishing the correct operating point. Setting it to 0.86V ensures that the transistor operates with the proper gate-source voltage to achieve our target drain current of 0.6 mA.', conclusion='The Common-Source amplifier design presented here meets all the specified requirements for DC gain, bandwidth, and output voltage. By carefully sizing the transistor and selecting appropriate values for the load resistor and bias voltage, the amplifier achieves a gain of -5 V/V with a bandwidth exceeding 50 Mrad/s while maintaining the desired output DC level of 900 mV.\n\nThe design approach demonstrates the application of fundamental analog circuit principles, including small-signal analysis, DC biasing considerations, and frequency response calculations. The final design represents a balanced solution that satisfies multiple competing requirements simultaneously.\n\nThis exercise highlights the importance of methodical analysis and the careful consideration of trade-offs in analog circuit design.
