{'completion_tokens': 1062, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To implement the `write` function, we need to follow a series of steps to ensure that the data is correctly written to the file system image. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Locate the File**: First, we need to find the inode associated with the file name provided. This involves traversing the directory structure to match the file name to its corresponding inode.\n\n2. **Validate the File**: Once the inode is found, we need to check if it is indeed a file and not a directory. If it is a directory, we raise an `IsADirectoryError`. If the file does not exist, we raise a `FileNotFoundError`.\n\n3. **Validate the Position**: We need to ensure that the position `pos` is within the valid range. If `pos` is negative or greater than the current file size, we raise a `ValueError`.\n\n4. **Encode Data**: Convert the input string `data` into UTF-8 encoded bytes.\n\n5. **Calculate Write Range**: Determine the range of bytes that need to be written, starting from `pos` and extending to `pos + len(data_bytes)`.\n\n6. **Allocate Blocks**: If the write operation extends beyond the current file size, we need to allocate additional blocks using `fs_img.allocate_block()`. Update the inode's `direct_blocks` list to include these new blocks.\n\n7. **Write Data**: For each block that needs to be written to, calculate the appropriate byte range within the block and write the data. This may involve overwriting existing data or appending new data.\n\n8. **Update Inode Size**: After writing, update the inode's size to reflect the new file size, which is the maximum of the old size and `pos + len(data_bytes)`.\n\n9. **Return Updated FileSystemImage**: Finally, return the modified `fs_img` so that the changes can be inspected.\n\nThe implementation of this logic will ensure that the `write` function correctly modifies the file system image according to the specified parameters.", config=ConfigFile(write='def write(fs_img: FileSystemImage, name: str, pos: int, data: str) -> FileSystemImage:\n    # Step 1: Locate the file\n    # Traverse directories to find the inode for the file name\n    inode_number = None\n    for dir_inode, entries in fs_img.directories.items():\n        for entry in entries:\n            if entry.name == name:\n                inode_number = entry.inode\n                break\n        if inode_number is not None:\n            break\n\n    # Step 2: Validate the file\n    if inode_number is None:\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File \'{name}\' not found.")\n\n    inode = fs_img.inodes[inode_number]\n    if inode.is_dir:\n        raise IsADirectoryError(f"\'{name}\' is a directory.")\n\n    # Step 3: Validate the position\n    if pos < 0 or pos > inode.size:\n        raise ValueError("Position is out of bounds.")\n\n    # Step 4: Encode data\n    data_bytes = data.encode(\'utf-8\')\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate write range\n    end_pos = pos + len(data_bytes)\n\n    # Step 6: Allocate blocks if necessary\n    while len(inode.direct_blocks) * fs_img.superblock.block_size < end_pos:\n        new_block_idx = fs_img.allocate_block()\n        inode.direct_blocks.append(new_block_idx)\n\n    # Step 7: Write data\n    block_size = fs_img.superblock.block_size\n    current_pos = pos\n    for block_idx in inode.direct_blocks:\n        block_start = (block_idx - inode.direct_blocks[0]) * block_size\n        block_end = block_start + block_size\n\n        if current_pos >= end_pos:\n            break\n\n        if current_pos < block_start:\n            current_pos = block_start\n\n        write_start = max(current_pos, block_start)\n        write_end = min(end_pos, block_end)\n\n        if write_start < write_end:\n            block_offset = write_start - block_start\n            data_offset = write_start - pos\n            data_length = write_end - write_start\n\n            # Write data to the block\n            block_data = fs_img.data_blocks[block_idx] or b\'\'\n            block_data = (block_data[:block_offset] +\n                          data_bytes[data_offset:data_offset + data_length] +\n                          block_data[block_offset + data_length:])\n            fs_img.data_blocks[block_idx] = block_data\n\n        current_pos = write_end\n\n    # Step 8: Update inode size\n    inode.size = max(inode.size, end_pos)\n\n    # Step 9: Return updated FileSystemImage\n    return fs_img')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'write': 'correctly raised error for non-existent file', 'read': 'Error in read content check '}, 'score': 20}
