{'completion_tokens': 1100, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To implement the `write` function, we need to follow a series of steps to ensure that the data is correctly written to the file system image. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Locate the File**: First, we need to find the inode associated with the file name provided. This involves traversing the directory structure to match the file name to its corresponding inode. If the file does not exist, we raise a `FileNotFoundError`. If the name refers to a directory, we raise an `IsADirectoryError`.\n\n2. **Validate Position**: Check if the provided position `pos` is valid. It should not be negative or greater than the current size of the file. If it is, raise a `ValueError`.\n\n3. **Encode Data**: Convert the input string `data` into UTF-8 encoded bytes. This is necessary because the file system stores data in byte format.\n\n4. **Extend File if Necessary**: If the write operation extends beyond the current end of the file, we need to allocate new blocks. This involves:\n   - Calculating how many additional blocks are needed.\n   - Using `fs_img.allocate_block()` to allocate these blocks.\n   - Updating the inode's `direct_blocks` list to include these new blocks.\n\n5. **Calculate Block and Byte Ranges**: Determine which blocks and byte ranges within those blocks correspond to the target file range `[pos, pos + len(bytes))`. This involves calculating the starting block and offset within that block, as well as any subsequent blocks that will be affected by the write operation.\n\n6. **Write Data**: For each block that is affected by the write operation, update the corresponding entry in `fs_img.data_blocks`. This may involve overwriting existing data or appending new data.\n\n7. **Update Inode Size**: After writing the data, update the inode's `size` to reflect the new size of the file. This is the maximum of the old size and `pos + len(bytes)`.\n\n8. **Return Updated FileSystemImage**: Finally, return the modified `fs_img` so that the changes can be inspected for correctness.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the `write` function correctly modifies the file system image to reflect the new data.", config=ConfigFile(write='def write(fs_img: FileSystemImage, name: str, pos: int, data: str) -> FileSystemImage:\n    # Step 1: Locate the file\n    # Traverse the directory structure to find the inode\n    inode_number = None\n    for dir_inode, entries in fs_img.directories.items():\n        for entry in entries:\n            if entry.name == name:\n                inode_number = entry.inode\n                break\n        if inode_number is not None:\n            break\n    \n    if inode_number is None:\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File \'{name}\' not found.")\n\n    inode = fs_img.inodes[inode_number]\n    if inode.is_dir:\n        raise IsADirectoryError(f"\'{name}\' is a directory.")\n\n    # Step 2: Validate position\n    if pos < 0 or pos > inode.size:\n        raise ValueError("Position is out of bounds.")\n\n    # Step 3: Encode data\n    data_bytes = data.encode(\'utf-8\')\n    data_length = len(data_bytes)\n\n    # Step 4: Extend file if necessary\n    end_pos = pos + data_length\n    if end_pos > inode.size:\n        # Calculate number of additional blocks needed\n        additional_blocks_needed = (end_pos - inode.size + fs_img.superblock.block_size - 1) // fs_img.superblock.block_size\n        for _ in range(additional_blocks_needed):\n            new_block_idx = fs_img.allocate_block()\n            inode.direct_blocks.append(new_block_idx)\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate block and byte ranges\n    block_size = fs_img.superblock.block_size\n    start_block = pos // block_size\n    start_offset = pos % block_size\n\n    # Step 6: Write data\n    bytes_written = 0\n    while bytes_written < data_length:\n        block_idx = inode.direct_blocks[start_block]\n        block_data = fs_img.data_blocks[block_idx] or b\'\'\n\n        # Calculate how much data to write in this block\n        write_offset = start_offset if bytes_written == 0 else 0\n        write_length = min(block_size - write_offset, data_length - bytes_written)\n\n        # Update block data\n        new_block_data = block_data[:write_offset] + data_bytes[bytes_written:bytes_written + write_length] + block_data[write_offset + write_length:]\n        fs_img.data_blocks[block_idx] = new_block_data\n\n        bytes_written += write_length\n        start_block += 1\n\n    # Step 7: Update inode size\n    inode.size = max(inode.size, end_pos)\n\n    # Step 8: Return updated FileSystemImage\n    return fs_img')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'write': 'correctly raised error for non-existent file', 'read': 'Error in read content check '}, 'score': 20}
