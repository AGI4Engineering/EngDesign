{'completion_tokens': 24951, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To calculate the force on a driver's neck during cornering, I need to determine the maximum lateral acceleration the car can achieve and multiply it by the combined mass of the head and helmet. The car has a lateral grip coefficient (gripy) of 1.40 and a load sensitivity effect (loadEff) of 0.10. For a race car at high speed, downforce can be about 3 times the car's weight, making the total normal force 4 times the weight. However, grip doesn't increase linearly with load due to tire physics. Using the loadEff parameter, the effective grip coefficient is reduced by a factor of (4)^(-0.10) = 0.8706. This gives a maximum lateral acceleration of 4.875g or 47.82 m/s². With the head (5kg) and helmet (2kg) having a combined mass of 7kg, the force on the neck during maximum cornering is 7kg × 47.82 m/s² = 334.77 N.", config=ConfigFile(force_on_neck=334.77)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'corner_acceleration_differnce': -115.77494751736657}, 'score': 0}
