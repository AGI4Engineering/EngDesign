{'completion_tokens': 19555, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To calculate the maximum force on a driver's neck during cornering, I need to use the parameters from SetupFile.json. The key parameters affecting cornering are the car's mass (mcar = 728 kg), lateral grip coefficient (gripy = 1.40), load effect on grip (loadEff = 0.10), and downforce coefficient (clt = 3.1). The force on the neck equals the mass of head and helmet (5 kg + 2 kg = 7 kg) multiplied by the maximum lateral acceleration. The maximum lateral acceleration is determined by the baseline grip and additional grip from downforce. After analyzing how downforce affects grip at different speeds and accounting for how the loadEff parameter modifies the grip with increasing load, I calculated that the maximum lateral acceleration the car can achieve is approximately 59.8 m/s². Therefore, the maximum force on the driver's neck is 7 kg × 59.8 m/s² ≈ 418.6 N.", config=ConfigFile(force_on_neck=418.6)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'corner_acceleration_differnce': -199.6049475173666}, 'score': 0}
