{'completion_tokens': 206, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To compute the maximum possible load on the neck of the driver when the car is cornering, we need to consider the lateral force (centripetal force) acting on the head and helmet. The lateral force is given by F = m * a, where m is the mass of the head and helmet combined, and a is the lateral acceleration. The lateral acceleration can be derived from the gripy parameter (lateral grip coefficient) and gravitational acceleration (g = 9.81 m/s²). The combined mass of the head and helmet is 5 kg + 2 kg = 7 kg. The lateral acceleration is a = gripy * g. Therefore, the force on the neck is F = 7 kg * (1.40 * 9.81 m/s²) = 7 * 13.734 = 96.138 N.', config=ConfigFile(force_on_neck=96.138)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'corner_acceleration_differnce': 122.8570524826334}, 'score': 0}
