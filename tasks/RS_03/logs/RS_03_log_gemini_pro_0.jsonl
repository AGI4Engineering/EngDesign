{'completion_tokens': 604, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The task is to compute the maximum possible load (force) on the neck of the driver when the car is cornering. This force is a result of the lateral acceleration experienced by the driver's head and helmet.\n\nThe calculation proceeds in the following steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the total mass being accelerated by the neck:**\n    *   Mass of the driver's head (`m_head`) = 5 kg (given).\n    *   Mass of the helmet (`m_helmet`) = 2 kg (given).\n    *   The total mass whose inertia must be overcome by the neck muscles is `m_total_head` = `m_head` + `m_helmet` = 5 kg + 2 kg = 7 kg.\n\n2.  **Determine the maximum lateral acceleration of the car:**\n    *   The `SetupFile.json` provides car parameters. The key parameter for maximum lateral acceleration during cornering is `gripy`.\n    *   From the provided file content, `gripy` = 1.40.\n    *   This parameter (`gripy`) is interpreted as the maximum lateral acceleration the car can sustain, expressed in Gs (multiples of the acceleration due to gravity, `g`). This value is assumed to be an effective grip limit, potentially incorporating typical aerodynamic contributions without needing explicit aerodynamic calculations (which would require further parameters like car speed, frontal area, and corner radius, not all of which are unambiguously provided or specified).\n    *   The standard acceleration due to gravity (`g`) is taken as 9.81 m/s².\n    *   Therefore, the maximum lateral acceleration (`a_lat_max`) = `gripy` × `g`.\n    *   `a_lat_max` = 1.40 × 9.81 m/s² = 13.734 m/s².\n\n3.  **Calculate the maximum force (load) on the neck:**\n    *   The force on the neck (`F_neck`) is calculated using Newton's second law of motion: Force = Mass × Acceleration.\n    *   `F_neck` = `m_total_head` × `a_lat_max`.\n    *   `F_neck` = 7 kg × 13.734 m/s².\n    *   `F_neck` = 96.138 N.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible load on the neck of the driver when the car is cornering at its limit is 96.138 Newtons.", config=ConfigFile(force_on_neck=96.138)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'corner_acceleration_differnce': 122.8570524826334}, 'score': 0}
