The motor's maximum speed is 4000 rpm. The linear velocity (v) is related to the wheel diameter (d) and gear ratio (r) by the formula: v = (motor_rpm * π * d) / (60 * r). Rearranging for r: r = (motor_rpm * π * d) / (60 * v). Using v = 3.0 m/s and assuming a wheel diameter of 0.1 m (a reasonable guess for a lightweight robot), we get r ≈ 6.98. We can round this to r = 7 for simplicity.\n\n2. **Incline Climbing Constraint (10-degree incline)**: The robot must overcome gravity and rolling resistance to climb the incline. The force required to climb is F = m * g * sin(θ) + m * g * cos(θ) * μ, where θ is the incline angle (10 degrees) and μ is the rolling resistance coefficient (0.015). The torque required at the wheel is T = F * (d/2). The motor torque is amplified by the gear ratio, so the motor must provide T_motor = T / r. Using m = 10 kg (a reasonable mass for a lightweight robot), we find F ≈ 17.3 N, T ≈ 0.865 Nm, and T_motor ≈ 0.124 Nm, which is within the motor's max torque of 0.3 Nm.\n\n3. **Battery Capacity Constraint (30 minutes at 2.5 m/s)**: The power required to maintain cruising speed is P = F_rolling * v, where F_rolling = m * g * μ. For m = 10 kg, F_rolling ≈ 1.47 N, and P ≈ 3.68 W. Accounting for motor efficiency (80%), the electrical power required is P_elec ≈ 4.6 W. For 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the energy required is E = P_elec * t ≈ 2.3 Wh. To ensure some margin, we can choose a battery capacity of C = 10 Wh.\n\n4. **Final Parameter Check**: With r = 7, d = 0.1 m, C = 10 Wh, and m = 10 kg, all constraints are satisfied:\n   - Top speed: ≈3.0 m/s\n   - Incline climbing: motor torque requirement is within limits\n   - Battery capacity: sufficient for 30 minutes of cruising with margin.", config=ConfigFile(battery_capacity=10.0, gear_ratio=7.0, wheel_diameter=0.1, body_mass=10.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'v_max_mps': 2.9919930034188504, 'T_wheel_Nm': 1.6800000000000002, 'T_required_Nm': 0.9242015418841666, 'C_required_Wh': 2.2992187499999996, 'C_given': 10.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 70}
