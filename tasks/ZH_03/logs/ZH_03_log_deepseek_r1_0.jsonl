For top speed, the gear ratio and wheel diameter were chosen to ensure the motor's RPM translates to \u22653.0 m/s. Incline climbing required verifying that motor torque, amplified by the gear ratio, overcomes gravitational and rolling resistance forces. Battery capacity was calculated based on energy consumed during 30 minutes of cruising, considering motor efficiency.
