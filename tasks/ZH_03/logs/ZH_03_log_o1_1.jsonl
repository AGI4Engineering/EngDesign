{'completion_tokens': 4315, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Below is a consistent example showing how one can choose the four design parameters to meet all three requirements:\n\n1. Top speed ≥ 3.0 m/s:\n   - With the motor spinning at 4000 rpm = 66.67 revolutions per second, the linear speed of the wheel at a 1:1 ratio would be (66.67 × π × d). By choosing gear_ratio = 4 and d = 0.06 m, the wheel’s linear speed is (66.67 × π × 0.06) / 4 ≈ 3.14 m/s, which exceeds 3.0 m/s.\n\n2. Incline climb (10°) capability:\n   - For mass = 7 kg, the force to climb 10° includes mg sin(10°) plus rolling friction. mg sin(10°) ≈ 7 × 9.81 × 0.1736 ≈ 11.9 N, rolling friction = 0.015 × 7 × 9.81 × cos(10°) ≈ 1.1 N, so total ≈ 13.0 N.\n   - The torque at the wheel needed is 13.0 N × (0.06 / 2) = 0.39 Nm.\n   - The gear train delivers wheel torque = (motor torque) × (gear ratio) × (efficiency) = 0.3 Nm × 4 × 0.8 = 0.96 Nm, enough to climb the slope.\n\n3. 30 minutes of level cruising at 2.5 m/s:\n   - On flat ground at 2.5 m/s for a 7 kg robot, the rolling friction force is ~ (0.015 × 7 × 9.81) = 1.03 N, plus a small aerodynamic drag (≈ 0.19 N assumed), total ~1.22 N.\n   - Mechanical power = 1.22 N × 2.5 m/s ≈ 3.05 W. With 80% motor efficiency, the electrical input is ~3.05 / 0.8 = 3.81 W. Over 30 min (0.5 h), this is 1.9 Wh required. Choosing a 10 Wh battery comfortably covers 30 min.\n', config=ConfigFile(battery_capacity=10.0, gear_ratio=4.0, wheel_diameter=0.06, body_mass=7.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'v_max_mps': 3.1415926535897927, 'T_wheel_Nm': 0.96, 'T_required_Nm': 0.38816464759134994, 'C_required_Wh': 1.6094531249999997, 'C_given': 10.0, 'passed': True}, 'score': 100}
