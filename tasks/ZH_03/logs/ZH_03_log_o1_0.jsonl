{'completion_tokens': 3218, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Below is a concise illustration of how one can arrive at a feasible design:\n\n1) Top Speed ≥ 3.0 m/s:\n   The motor runs at about 4000 rpm (≈ 419 rad/s). After gearing by r, the wheel’s angular speed is ω_wheel = (419 / r). With a wheel radius of d/2, the linear speed is v = ω_wheel × (d/2). We want at least 3.0 m/s.\n\n2) Ability to Climb a 10° Incline:\n   The required wheel torque is T_req = m × g × sin(10°) × (d/2). The motor can supply up to 0.3 Nm, which is multiplied by the gear ratio r, so T_out = 0.3 × r must exceed T_req.\n\n3) Battery Life for 30 Minutes at 2.5 m/s:\n   On flat ground, the main losses are rolling resistance, F_roll = c_rr × m × g, plus aerodynamic drag, which is modest for a low-speed, small-cross-section robot. The mechanical power is P_mech = F_total × v, and the battery must supply P_batt = P_mech / η, where η=80% is motor efficiency. For 30 minutes, battery energy must be ≥ P_batt × 0.5 hours.\n\nChosen Parameters:\n• Gear ratio r = 7\n• Wheel diameter d = 0.15 m\n• Mass m = 15 kg\n• Battery capacity C = 60 Wh\n\nThese values achieve:\n• Top speed of about 4.5 m/s (exceeding the 3.0 m/s requirement)\n• Enough torque at the wheel to handle a 10° climb\n• Ample battery capacity to cruise 30 minutes at 2.5 m/s', config=ConfigFile(battery_capacity=60.0, gear_ratio=7.0, wheel_diameter=0.15, body_mass=15.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'v_max_mps': 4.487989505128275, 'T_wheel_Nm': 1.6800000000000002, 'T_required_Nm': 2.0794534692393745, 'C_required_Wh': 3.448828125, 'C_given': 60.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 60}
