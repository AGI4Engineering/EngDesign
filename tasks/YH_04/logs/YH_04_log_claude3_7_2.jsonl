These definitions ensure that the dimensions are treated as constants during synthesis, allowing the compiler to optimize accordingly.\n\nFor the interface design, I applied HLS pragmas to specify the AXI interfaces. The three matrices A, B, and C were each assigned to separate AXI4 master interfaces (using m_axi pragmas with different bundle names) to enable concurrent memory access. The function itself was configured with an AXI4-Lite slave interface for control signals.\n\nTo optimize performance, I structured the loops to maximize locality and enable efficient pipelining. The innermost loop, which performs the dot product computation, was explicitly pipelined using the HLS PIPELINE pragma with an initiation interval (II) of 1, allowing a new iteration to start every clock cycle.\n\nFor memory access optimization, I considered the access patterns of the matrices. In typical GEMM operations, matrix A is accessed row-wise, matrix B is accessed column-wise, and matrix C is accessed for both reading (initialization) and writing (result storage). To improve memory access efficiency, I added local accumulators to reduce the frequency of global memory accesses.\n\nThe core computation follows the standard matrix multiplication formula: C[i][j] = ∑(A[i][k] * B[k][j]) for all k from 0 to K_SIZE-1. This accumulation is performed using floating-point operations, as specified by the float data type in the function signature.\n\nThe implementation takes into account the resource constraints of the VCK5000 board, particularly in terms of DSP slices (which are heavily used for floating-point operations) and memory bandwidth (crucial for matrix operations with large data sets).'), results=Results(parameters='The final GEMM implementation has the following key parameters and characteristics:\n\n1.
