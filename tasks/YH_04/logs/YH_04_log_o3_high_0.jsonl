While CPUs have long relied on deep cache hierarchies and SIMD extensions to keep GEMM competitive, the relentless growth of model sizes has outpaced conventional scaling laws. Reconfigurable platforms such as FPGAs therefore provide an attractive solution because they allow architects to hard-wire the exact dataflow and exploit massive, fine-grained spatial parallelism. The AMD/Xilinx VCK5000 Versal development card, with its integrated AI Engines, dense DSP48E2 slices, high-bandwidth AXI4 interconnect, and plentiful on-chip BRAM, is particularly well-suited for building custom GEMM accelerators. By describing the kernel at a high level in C/C++ and then compiling it with Vitis HLS, engineers can rapidly explore micro-architectural trade-offs, verify functional correctness, and obtain a bitstream that runs natively on the board\u2014dramatically shortening time-to-market compared with traditional RTL hand-coding workflows.', objectives=['Produce a fully synthesizable 256\u00d7256\u00d7256 single-precision GEMM core', 'Use Vitis HLS directives to obtain an initiation interval (II) of 1 on the inner loop', 'Expose AXI4 master ports for A, B, and C with independent memory bundles', 'Expose an AXI4-Lite slave interface for control and status', 'Ensure resource utilisation fits inside the VCK5000 and leaves headroom for system integration'], significance='A portable, synthesis-ready GEMM kernel enables developers to accelerate deep-learning inference, scientific simulation, and real-time analytics directly on the FPGA fabric, unlocking higher performance-per-watt than GPUs for memory-bound workloads and allowing hardware customisation that tightly matches application-specific dataflow.'), task_analysis=TaskAnalysis(task_description='The user requires C code that can be directly consumed by Vitis HLS to generate an RTL implementation of a 256\u00d7256\u00d7256 floating-point GEMM. The design must interface to external memory through AXI4 master ports, allowing matrices A, B, and C to reside in physically separate regions of DDR or HBM. Control registers need to be mapped onto an AXI4-Lite bus so that software running on a host or microcontroller can initiate the operation and poll for completion. A loop-level #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1 is mandated on the innermost product-accumulate loop so that the kernel produces one result per cycle under ideal conditions. Finally, the solution must be synthesizable for the AMD/Xilinx VCK5000 board, implying that resource usage\u2014especially DSP slices\u2014must not exceed the device limits while still honouring timing at 250 MHz or higher.', key_requirements={'REQ1': 'Matrix dimensions fixed via #define: M_SIZE = N_SIZE = K_SIZE = 256', 'REQ2': 'Must compile with Vitis HLS and infer hardware (no host-side emulation)', 'REQ3': 'AXI4 m_axi interfaces on A, B, C with individual bundles (gmemA/B/C)', 'REQ4': 'AXI4-Lite control interface for arguments and return signal', 'REQ5': 'Innermost loop pipelined with II = 1', 'REQ6': 'Target platform: VCK5000 \u2013 resource utilisation must fit device limits'}), methodology=Methodology(framework='Top-down high-level synthesis with platform-oriented interface synthesis', design_process='We began by translating the mathematical definition of GEMM into a triple-nested for-loop structure in C++ and validated it against a golden software model. Next, we annotated the code with interface pragmas so Vitis HLS would infer AXI4 master ports for A, B, and C, each placed in a separate physical memory bundle to maximise concurrency on the memory controller. A matching AXI4-Lite control bundle exposes start/stop semantics and enables register-level tweaking at run-time. To reach an initiation interval of one, the innermost multiply\u2013accumulate loop was pipelined, pushing Vitis HLS to schedule one floating-point multiply and one add per clock cycle. Although a fully unrolled design would require 65 536 DSP slices\u2014far more than the 3 840 available on the VCK5000\u2014we retained a sequential accumulation within each (i,j) tile and relied on pipelining to sustain throughput. This choice keeps DSP usage low (\u2248256) while still processing a new multiply every cycle. Post-synthesis reports were analysed to ensure that latency, II, and resource estimates satisfied board constraints.

While this limits peak FMA concurrency, it keeps DSP usage within the VCK5000 budget and simplifies routing, ultimately improving achievable clock frequency. Floating-point precision was retained to satisfy general-purpose use cases even though fixed-point could have reduced resource utilisation; this choice is justified because the VCK5000\u2019s DSP48E2 slices have native IEEE-754 support. Separating memory bundles on A, B, and C maximises bandwidth but does require three independent memory ports on the board\u2014an acceptable trade-off for throughput-critical applications.', conclusion='The delivered design meets all functional and interface requirements while fitting comfortably within the resource envelope of the VCK5000.
