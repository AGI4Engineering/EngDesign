Early FPGA users wrote RTL by hand, which was time-consuming and error-prone, especially for complex compute kernels such as matrix multiplication. Vitis HLS from Xilinx allows C/C++ kernels to be synthesized directly into RTL, significantly accelerating design cycles. The Versal VCK5000 board, featuring AI engines and abundant programmable logic, provides an ideal platform for deploying high-throughput linear algebra routines in hardware.', objectives=['Implement a 256\u00d7256\u00d7256 GEMM operation in C for HLS synthesis', 'Use AXI4 master interfaces for matrices A, B, and C', 'Pipeline the inner multiplication loop to achieve an initiation interval of 1', 'Ensure AXI4-Lite control interface and compatibility with VCK5000 board'], significance='Efficient matrix multiplication is the cornerstone of many HPC and ML workloads.
