The GEMM function was written in C, with adherence to high-level synthesis constraints and optimization practices. AXI4 interfaces were implemented for matrices A, B, and C to facilitate high-throughput data transfer, and an AXI4-Lite interface was added for function control. To achieve the desired performance, the innermost loop responsible for the computation was pipelined using the #pragma HLS PIPELINE directive with II=1. This ensured that new operations in the loop could begin execution every cycle, maximizing the hardware's computational capabilities.
