We utilized C language to describe the functionality of matrix multiplication. The code was structured to define matrix dimensions as constants using #define directives. The matrices A, B, and C were defined as input/output interfaces with the AXI4 protocol. The algorithm was implemented within nested loops to traverse rows and columns of the matrices and compute the dot product for multiplication.
