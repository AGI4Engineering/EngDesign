By limiting loop unrolling and focusing pipelining on the innermost loop, the implementation uses minimal DSPs and logic while still achieving II=1.

This design demonstrates how high-level synthesis can efficiently map C code to FPGA hardware, achieving a good compromise between resource utilization and performance.
