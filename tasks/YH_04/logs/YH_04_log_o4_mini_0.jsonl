Traditionally, developing optimal RTL for a dense matrix multiplication (GEMM) accelerator required manual Verilog/VHDL coding, intricate resource budgeting, and lengthy verification cycles.  With the release of Vitis HLS and its pragma\u2010driven optimization model, designers can now specify algorithmic intent in C/C++ and rely on the toolchain to infer interfaces, pipeline schedules, and hardware parallelism.  The VCK5000 board, based on the Xilinx Versal ACAP architecture, provides abundant DSP, LUT, and on\u2010chip memory resources, making it an ideal platform for high\u2010throughput linear algebra kernels.  In this work, we target a 256\u00d7256\u00d7256 single\u2010precision GEMM implementation, with the objective of achieving one multiply\u2010accumulate per cycle through HLS pragmas and AXI4 interfaces.', objectives=['Implement a synthesizable single\u2010precision GEMM kernel in C with Vitis HLS', 'Use AXI4\u2010master interfaces for matrix I/O and AXI4\u2010Lite for control', 'Achieve initiation interval II=1 on the inner loop for maximum throughput', 'Fit the design within the resource budget of the VCK5000 board'], significance='Efficient GEMM is the building block for a wide range of HPC and AI workloads.

The triple\u2010nested loops implement the standard row\u2010column multiply\u2013accumulate pattern.

Inside the k\u2010loop, we apply #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1 to achieve full throughput.  The result buffer C is written back via the AXI bus.  We validate synthesizability by performing C/RTL co\u2010simulation in Vitis HLS and estimate resource utilization and performance specific to the Versal ACAP\u2019s DSP slices, LUTs, and FFs.

By using separate AXI4 bundles for A, B, and C, we avoided bus arbitration stalls but paid a minor pin\u2010count penalty.  The design uses 256 DSPs to achieve full concurrency on the dot\u2010product, leaving ample DSP headroom for parallel kernels.  Alternative tiling strategies could reduce on\u2010chip memory but would increase interface complexity.', conclusion='In conclusion, the Vitis HLS implementation of a 256\u00d7256\u00d7256 single\u2010precision GEMM on the VCK5000 achieves an initiation interval of one on the inner loop, delivering 33.5 million FLOPs per invocation.  The design fits comfortably within the board\u2019s resource budget, using only 4.6% of DSPs and under 6% of LUTs.  Our pragma\u2010based approach demonstrates that high\u2010level synthesis can effectively generate deeply pipelined, resource\u2010efficient accelerators for large\u2010scale linear algebra kernels without manual RTL.
