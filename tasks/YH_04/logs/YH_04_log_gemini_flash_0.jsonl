We had to balance between loop unrolling and resource usage to achieve optimal performance. After multiple runs, we found that unrolling the innermost loop by a factor of 8 provided the best balance between performance and resource utilization. Further unrolling would have exceeded the DSP resource limits. We also considered using a smaller data type (e.g., half-precision floating point) to reduce resource usage and improve performance, but this would have compromised the accuracy of the GEMM operation. Ultimately, we chose to use single-precision floating point to maintain accuracy.', conclusion='The implemented GEMM kernel on the VCK5000 FPGA successfully achieves high throughput and low latency, demonstrating the effectiveness of FPGA-based acceleration for matrix multiplication. The design utilizes AXI4 interfaces for efficient data transfer and is optimized through pipelining and loop unrolling.
