First, I calculated the resultant force from the applied traction [10, -20, 0] N/mm² over the face area. Next, I estimated the in-plane deflection using cantilever beam theory, considering the L-shaped geometry with dimensions Lh = 50mm, Lv = 80mm, and Rf = 20mm. Since the load has no z-component, the z-displacement will result from Poisson's effect. Using the relationship δz ≈ -ν × Δin-plane × (Height/L), I derived that δz ≈ -968/Th² mm. Setting this equal to 0.08mm (middle of the optimal range), I calculated Th ≈ 15.6mm. Therefore, I recommend a thickness of 16mm, which should provide a maximum z-displacement within the desired 0.07-0.09mm range.", config=ConfigFile(Th=16.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_z': 0.02865021816679363, 'threshold': 0.1}, 'score': 40.92888309541947}
