Two orthogonal legs of length Lh = 50 mm and Lv = 80 mm meet at a 20 mm fillet.  The wall thickness Th is the only design variable.  The 3-D solid is 50 mm long in the z-direction, one end (Face-4) is fixed, and the opposite end (Face-5) is loaded by a uniform surface traction [10, −20, 0] N mm⁻².\n\nStep-2  |  Resultant forces and torsional moment\nArea of the 2-D contour  A(Th) ≃ Th·(Lh+Lv−Th) ≈ Th·(130 − Th)  (mm²)\nResultant forces  Fx = 10·A ,  Fy = −20·A  (N)\nBecause the centroid of a thin-walled L lies roughly at (x̄≈10 mm , ȳ≈25 mm) from the inside corner, those forces generate an out-of-plane torsional moment\n  T ≈ | x̄·Fy − ȳ·Fx | ≈ 438·A  ≈ 438·Th·130  ≈ 5.7·10⁴·Th   N·mm\n\nStep-3  |  St-Venant torsional stiffness\nFor an open thin-walled L-section the St-Venant torsion constant is\n  J ≈ (1/3)·Th³·(Lh+Lv−Th) ≈ 43.3·Th³  (mm⁴)\nThe elastic (shear) modulus is  G = E/[2(1+ν)] = 21 000 / 2.6 ≃ 8077 MPa = 8.08·10³ N mm⁻².\n\nStep-4  |  End rotation produced by torsion\n  θ = T·Height / (G·J) ≈ (5.7·10⁴·Th·50) / (8.08·10³·43.3·Th³)\n                = 8.13 / Th²   (radians)\n\nStep-5  |  Out-of-plane tip displacement (wanted quantity)\nThe point farthest from the shear centre is approx. e ≈ 68 mm away.  The maximum warping displacement is\n  uz,max ≈ θ·e ≈ (8.13·68) / Th² ≈ 553 / Th²   (mm)\n\nRequiring uz,max ≤ 0.1 mm gives  Th ≥ √(553/0.1) ≈ 7.4 mm.\n\nStep-6  |  Selecting a target value\nTo aim for the scoring ‘sweet-spot’ (70 – 90 % of the 0.1 mm limit) we set uz,target ≈ 0.08 mm, giving\n  Th_target ≈ √(553/0.08) ≈ 6.7 mm.\nRounding to a practical dimension we adopt  Th = 6.5 mm.\n\nStep-7  |  Expected performance\nSubstituting Th = 6.5 mm into the expression above:\n  uz,est ≈ 553 / 6.5² ≈ 0.088 mm → 88 % of the 0.1 mm ceiling.\nThis sits neatly inside the 70 – 90 % band, so the design should obtain the full score while avoiding unnecessary weight and material cost.\n\nHence the proposed wall thickness for the L-beam is 6.5 mm.', config=ConfigFile(Th=6.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_z': 0.13977370224563207, 'threshold': 0.1}, 'score': 0.0}
