{'completion_tokens': 4000, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Below is a simple approximate calculation using the idea that the maximum deflection under bending scales inversely with the cube of the thickness (all other dimensions and the applied load held the same). We first assume that at a reference thickness of 4 mm, the maximum displacement might be about 0.12 mm—slightly above the 0.1 mm limit. If we denote the deflection at thickness T by δ(T), then:\n\n  δ(T) ≈ δ(4 mm) × (4 / T)³ = 0.12 × (4 / T)³.\n\nWe want δ(T) < 0.1 mm. Substituting into the above:\n\n  0.12 × (4 / T)³ < 0.1\n  ⇒ (4 / T)³ < 5/6 ≈ 0.833,\n  ⇒ 4 / T < 0.943,\n  ⇒ T > 4 / 0.943 ≈ 4.24 mm,\n\nso any thickness above about 4.24 mm should keep the deflection below 0.1 mm. However, to earn the highest score, the maximum deflection must not be too far below 0.1 mm—namely between 70% and 90% of 0.1 mm (i.e., 0.07 to 0.09 mm). This corresponds to:\n\n  0.12 × (4 / T)³ ∈ [0.07, 0.09].\n\nSolving these bounds shows that T must be roughly between 4.4 mm and 4.8 mm. A well-rounded choice in this range is 4.5 mm, which should yield a max deflection around 0.08–0.09 mm—comfortably between 70% and 90% of the 0.1 mm limit, and thus provides a balanced design with sufficient stiffness and good scoring potential.', config=ConfigFile(Th=4.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_z': 0.24950347102758166, 'threshold': 0.1}, 'score': 0.0}
