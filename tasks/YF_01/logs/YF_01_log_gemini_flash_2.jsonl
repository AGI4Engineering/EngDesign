The design variables are `Lh = 50` mm, `Lv = 80` mm, `Rf = 20` mm, and `Height = 50` mm.  The material properties are: Young’s modulus: 21,000 MPa and Poisson’s ratio: 0.3. The external surface traction: `[10, -20, 0]` N/mm² is applied to Face ID = 5 and Face ID = 4 is fixed. \n\nSince we want the `uz` to be less than 0.1 mm, we are looking for stiffness sufficient to resist the applied load and limit deflection. We can use the simplified bending stress equation to guide our thickness selection.\n\nTo begin, let's simplify the problem and estimate the load and equivalent bending moment on the L-beam. The applied traction is equivalent to force per area, so we need to estimate the area the force acts upon. Assume the face to which the external force is applied has roughly dimensions equal to the height times the thickness, so  `Area = H * Th`. Therefore, the force will be `Force = Traction * Area`. However, the traction varies in x and y directions, thus, `Force_x = 10 * H * Th` and `Force_y = -20 * H * Th`. The total force is then `Force = sqrt(Force_x^2 + Force_y^2) = sqrt(10^2 + (-20)^2) * H * Th = 22.36 * H * Th = 22.36 * 50 * Th = 1118 * Th`. \n\nThe exact bending moment depends on the position of the applied forces and the supports. Assuming the beam is fixed at one end and the force is applied at the free end, and assuming the length is approximately the horizontal length `Lh` since `Lv` will affect the moment negligibly since the load direction will be similar. Then `M = Force * Lh = 1118 * Th * Lh = 1118 * Th * 50 = 55900 * Th`.\n\nThe bending stress `sigma = M * y / I`, where y is the distance from the neutral axis and `I` is the second moment of area. `I = (b*h^3)/12`, where b is width and h is thickness. Since `H` and `Th` both influence the moment of area, let's assume that `Th` represents the h in the moment of area calculation, and that `b = Lh + Lv - 2*Rf + Th = 50 + 80 - 40 + Th = 90 + Th`. Therefore `I = ((90+Th) * Th^3) / 12`. \n\nThe simplified deflection equation can be given by `deflection = (F * L^3) / (3 * E * I)`.\n\nGiven that the maximum deflection `uz` should be less than 0.1 mm, we can set up the following equation: `0.1 = (F * L^3) / (3 * E * I)`. Thus, `0.1 = (1118*Th * 50^3) / (3 * 21000 * ((90+Th) * Th^3) / 12)`. So `0.1 = (1118* 12 * Th * 50^3) / (3 * 21000 * (90+Th) * Th^3)`. Reducing the constants gives `0.1 = (559000000 * Th) / (63000*(90+Th)*Th^3)`. Therefore, `0.1 = 8873.01587 * Th / ((90+Th) * Th^3)`. Further simplification `0.1 * (90 + Th) * Th^3 = 8873.01587 * Th`. `(90+Th)*Th^2 = 88730.1587`. \n\nWe can solve the cubic equation `Th^3 + 90*Th^2 - 88730.1587 = 0`. Solve the equation we get that `Th = 27.25`. To be on the safe side, we are going to select `Th = 30`.
