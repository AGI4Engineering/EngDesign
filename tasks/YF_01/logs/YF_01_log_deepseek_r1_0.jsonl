The primary goal is to limit the maximum z-displacement (uz) to below 0.1 mm, targeting ~0.09 mm for optimal scoring. The beam's stiffness against torsion and bending is critical. Using simplified torsional stiffness calculations, the displacement uz is inversely proportional to Th³. Starting with an estimated Th=5 mm yielding uz≈0.2 mm, scaling by (0.2/0.09)^(1/3)≈1.3 gives Th≈6.5 mm. Rounding to a practical value and ensuring a safety margin, Th=8 mm is selected. This balances stiffness and material efficiency, likely keeping uz near the 0.09 mm target.", config=ConfigFile(Th=8.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_z': 0.10257308825089274, 'threshold': 0.1}, 'score': 0.0}
