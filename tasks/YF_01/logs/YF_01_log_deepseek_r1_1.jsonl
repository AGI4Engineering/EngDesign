The analysis focused on torsional and bending stiffness due to the applied traction [10, -20, 0] N/mm² on Face 5. The vertical arm (Lv = 80 mm) resists torsion from the horizontal arm's load, while the extrusion height (50 mm) amplifies z-displacement via angular twist. Using simplified torsion mechanics: torque T = Fy * Lh = (-1000 * Th) * 50 = -50,000 Th N·mm. Shear modulus G = 21,000 / (2*(1+0.3)) ≈ 8077 MPa. Polar moment J ≈ (50/3) * Th³ mm⁴. Angle of twist θ = T * Lv / (G * J) ≈ 29.73 / Th² radians. Resulting uz ≈ θ * 50 mm ≈ 1486.5 / Th² mm. Setting uz ≈ 0.08 mm yields Th ≈ √(1486.5/0.08) ≈ 136 mm, which is impractical. Re-evaluating bending effects and geometric constraints, a pragmatic Th = 20 mm is proposed, balancing stiffness and manufacturability, assuming minor model simplifications underestimate stiffness.", config=ConfigFile(Th=20.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_z': 0.015784691888750077, 'threshold': 0.1}, 'score': 22.549559841071538}
