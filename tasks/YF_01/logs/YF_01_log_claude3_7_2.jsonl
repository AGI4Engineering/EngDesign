The moment of inertia is proportional to the thickness cubed (t³) for a rectangular cross-section.\n\nSince we have an L-beam with a fillet, the exact analytical solution is complex, but I can approximate using beam theory.\n\nFor an L-beam, the maximum displacement can be estimated using:\nδ ∝ F·L³/(E·I)\nwhere I ∝ Th³\n\nTherefore: δ ∝ F·L³/(E·Th³)\n\nRearranging: Th ∝ ³√(F·L³/(E·δ))\n\nThe applied load has components [10, -20, 0] N/mm². The resultant magnitude is √(10² + (-20)²) = √(500) ≈ 22.36 N/mm².\n\nThe effective length can be estimated as the longer dimension plus half the shorter dimension: 80 + 50/2 = 105 mm.\n\nUsing these values and targeting a displacement of 0.08 mm (80% of threshold):\n\nTh ∝ ³√(22.36 × 105³/(21000 × 0.08))\n\nCalculating:\n22.36 × 105³ = 22.36 × 1,157,625 = 25,884,495\n21000 × 0.08 = 1,680\n25,884,495/1,680 = 15,407.4\n³√15,407.4 ≈ 24.9 mm\n\nThis is an approximation. Since the actual beam has a fillet and complex geometry, I'll adjust this value slightly.\n\nConsidering the complex geometry and the desire to achieve 70-90% of the threshold (0.07-0.09 mm displacement), I'll propose a thickness of 25 mm. This thickness should provide adequate stiffness while staying within the optimal performance range.", config=ConfigFile(Th=25.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_z': 0.006087041562967571, 'threshold': 0.1}, 'score': 8.695773661382244}
