Identify the loaded and fixed faces:\n   - Face 5 is the free lateral face of the horizontal leg (normal in +y), Area A₅ = Lh × Height = 50 mm × 50 mm = 2500 mm².\n   - Face 4 is the opposite lateral face (normal in –y) and is fixed; separation between faces = Th.\n\n2. Compute net forces on face 5 from the applied traction t = [10, –20, 0] N/mm²:\n   - Fₓ = 10 N/mm² × 2500 mm² = 25 000 N (normal)\n   - Fᵧ = –20 N/mm² × 2500 mm² = –50 000 N (shear)\n\n3. Decompose z-displacement across the thickness Th into two contributions:\n\n   a) Poisson effect (normal traction → lateral contraction in z):\n      σₓ = Fₓ/A₅ = 10 N/mm², σᵧ ≈ 0 on average →\n      ε_z = –ν/E·(σₓ+σᵧ) = –0.3/21000·10 = –1.43×10⁻⁴\n      ⇒ δ_z,Poisson = |ε_z|·Th ≃ 1.43×10⁻⁴·Th\n\n   b) Bending across thickness (shear force Fᵧ acting at a cantilever of length Th):\n      Approximate second moment of area of the extruded L-section about centroidal x-axis as I_x ≃ 9.19×10⁴·Th (mm⁴).\n      Using the cantilever tip-deflection formula δ = |Fᵧ|·Th³/(3·E·I_x):\n         δ_z,bend = 50 000·Th³/(3·21000·9.19×10⁴·Th) ≃ 7.97×10⁻⁵ mm (independent of Th to first order)\n\n4. Choose Th so that δ_z,total = δ_z,Poisson + δ_z,bend < 0.1 mm, and also satisfy manufacturing and geometric constraints:\n   - Poisson term → δ_z,Poisson = 1.43×10⁻⁴·Th. To keep this <0.1 mm ⇒ Th < 700 mm (no issue).\n   - For practical minimum thickness (avoiding buckling/slenderness) choose Th ≥ 5 mm.\n   - Fillet-to-thickness ratio Rf/Th = 20/5 = 4 keeps a smooth inside corner.\n\n5. For Th = 5 mm:\n   - δ_z,Poisson ≃ 1.43×10⁻⁴·5 = 7.14×10⁻⁴ mm\n   - δ_z,bend ≃ 7.97×10⁻⁵ mm\n   - δ_z,total ≃ 8.0×10⁻⁴ mm ≪ 0.1 mm\n\nThus Th = 5 mm gives a very stiff section, meets geometric/fillet and manufacturing constraints, and predicts δ_z ≪ 0.1 mm.', config=ConfigFile(Th=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_z': 0.21073990272367016, 'threshold': 0.1}, 'score': 0.0}
