Geometry of the beam\n2. Applied load\n3. Material properties\n4. Thickness of the beam\n\nFor a cantilever beam (which this approximates with one face fixed), the maximum deflection is proportional to:\nδ ∝ FL³/(3EI)\n\nWhere:\n- F is the applied force\n- L is the beam length\n- E is Young's modulus\n- I is the moment of inertia, which is proportional to thickness³ for a rectangular cross-section\n\nSince the deflection is inversely proportional to the thickness cubed:\nδ ∝ 1/Th³\n\nI'll approach this problem analytically first to get an estimate.\n\nFor an L-shaped beam, the maximum displacement would typically occur at the free end. The effective length of the beam can be approximated as the sum of the horizontal and vertical segments minus some overlap for the fillet: approximately 50 + 80 - 20 = 110 mm.\n\nThe applied surface traction is [10, -20, 0] N/mm², which means there's a significant load in both x and y directions, but none in the z-direction directly. However, this loading will cause twisting that creates z-displacement.\n\nThe moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section is:\nI = (b × h³)/12\nwhere b is the width and h is the thickness.\n\nFor our L-shaped beam, the calculation is more complex, but the principle that deflection is inversely proportional to thickness cubed still applies.\n\nLet's estimate that for a thickness of 10 mm, the maximum z-displacement might be around 0.05 mm (this is a rough estimate).\n\nSince displacement scales with 1/Th³:\nIf Th₁ gives displacement δ₁, then Th₂ would give displacement δ₂ where:\nδ₂/δ₁ = (Th₁/Th₂)³\n\nWe want to target a displacement of about 0.08 mm (80% of allowable):\n0.08/0.05 = (10/Th)³\n1.6 = (10/Th)³\n(10/Th) = ∛1.6\n(10/Th) = 1.17\nTh = 10/1.17 ≈ 8.55 mm\n\nLet's refine this. Since the beam has a complex L-shape with a fillet, the simple beam equations aren't perfectly accurate. The thickness should be sufficient to:\n1. Resist bending from the applied loads\n2. Minimize torsional effects that cause z-displacement\n3. Provide adequate stiffness at the connection point\n\nConsidering the dimensional constraints and loading conditions, a thickness of 8.5 mm should provide:\n- Sufficient stiffness to limit z-displacement to ~80% of allowable\n- Reasonable material usage\n- Adequate resistance to the applied surface traction\n\nTherefore, I propose a thickness (Th) of 8.5 mm for the L-shaped beam.", config=ConfigFile(Th=8.5)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_z': 0.0930529321689986, 'threshold': 0.1}, 'score': 69.47067831001408}
