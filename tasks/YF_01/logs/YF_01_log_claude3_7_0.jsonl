Using beam theory as an approximation, I analyzed the effect of the surface traction [10, -20, 0] N/mm² on the L-shaped beam with dimensions Lh=50mm, Lv=80mm, Rf=20mm, and Height=50mm. \n\nI first estimated the area of the loaded face as approximately (Lh + Lv - Rf) × Th = 110 × Th mm², resulting in force components Fx = 1100 × Th N and Fy = -2200 × Th N. Using a simplified cantilever beam deflection formula δz ≈ FyL³/(3EI) where I = Height × Th³/12, I derived that δz ≈ -18.43/Th². \n\nTargeting a displacement of 0.08 mm (80% of the threshold), I solved for Th = √(18.43/0.08) = 15.18 mm. Considering the complex geometry with fillet and 3D effects, I rounded to 15 mm as the final thickness value, which should keep the maximum z-displacement within the desired 70-90% range of the 0.1 mm threshold.', config=ConfigFile(Th=15.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_z': 0.033060680570469514, 'threshold': 0.1}, 'score': 47.22954367209931}
