Its stiffness grows rapidly with increasing thickness (roughly proportional to Th³ for elastic bending).\n\n2) Suppose that a thinner trial beam (say Th = 4 mm) is estimated—by a quick hand calculation or prior experience—to yield a maximum deflection of around 0.25 mm in the z-direction. Since deflection scales inversely with the cube of thickness:\n   δ ∝ 1 / Th³\n\n3) We want a final deflection δ ≈ 0.08 mm. Setting up a proportionality:\n   0.25 mm × (4 mm / Th)³ = 0.08 mm\n   => (4 mm / Th)³ = 0.08 / 0.25 = 0.32\n   => (4 mm / Th) = ³√0.32 ≈ 0.68\n   => Th ≈ 4 / 0.68 ≈ 5.9 mm\n\n4) Rounding to a convenient value, we propose Th = 6 mm. That should keep the peak displacement below 0.1 mm but near the 70–90% range of the limit to maximize score.\n', config=ConfigFile(Th=6.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_z': 0.15689381656034126, 'threshold': 0.1}, 'score': 0.0}
