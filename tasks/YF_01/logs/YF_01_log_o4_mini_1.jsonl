Identify the critical bending: the vertical leg of the L acts like a cantilevered plate of height a=80 mm, width (into the page) b=50 mm, thickness t=Th, loaded by the vertical component of the traction p=20 N/mm² on its free end.  \n2. For a cantilevered plate (edge‐load), the tip deflection is approximately  \n   w_max = (3 p a⁴) / (2 E b t³).  \n3. We target w_max ≈ 0.08 mm (80% of the 0.1 mm limit).  \n4. Solve for t:  \n   t³ = (3 p a⁴) / (2 E b w_max)  \n   = [3·20·(80)⁴] / [2·21000·50·0.08]  \n   ≃ 1.4607×10⁴ mm³  \n   ⇒ t ≃ (1.4607×10⁴)^(1/3) ≃ 24.2 mm.  \n5. Rounding up for safety and manufacturability gives Th ≃ 25 mm.  \n\nAt Th=25 mm, the estimated peak deflection is  \n   w_max ≃ (3·20·80⁴)/(2·21000·50·25³) ≃ 0.075 mm  \n(≈75% of the 0.1 mm limit, within the 70–90% window).', config=ConfigFile(Th=25.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_z': 0.006087041562967571, 'threshold': 0.1}, 'score': 8.695773661382244}
