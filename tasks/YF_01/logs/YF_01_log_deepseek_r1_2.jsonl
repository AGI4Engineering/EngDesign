{'completion_tokens': 8130, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To determine a suitable thickness (Th) for the L-beam, we consider the requirement that maximum z-displacement (uz) must be between 70% (0.07 mm) and 90% (0.09 mm) of the 0.1 mm threshold. Using simplified beam bending and Poisson’s effect analysis:\n\n1. **Load Calculation**: The traction force on Face 5 (area = 80 mm × 50 mm = 4000 mm²) yields Fy = -20 N/mm² × 4000 mm² = -80,000 N.\n2. **Bending Analysis**: The vertical leg acts as a cantilever. Moment of inertia (I) for the L-beam’s cross-section is approximated as I ≈ 92,894.27·Th mm⁴ (parallel axis theorem).\n3. **Strain in z-direction**: From bending stress σ = M·y/I and Poisson’s ratio, ε_z ≈ 0.0341/Th. Displacement uz = ε_z × extrusion height ≈ 1.705/Th mm.\n4. **Solve for Th**: Setting uz ≈ 0.08 mm (mid-range target) gives Th ≈ 21.3 mm. To ensure compliance with the 70–90% range, Th = 20 mm is selected, yielding uz ≈ 0.085 mm (85% of threshold), achieving full points.', config=ConfigFile(Th=20.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_z': 0.015784691888750077, 'threshold': 0.1}, 'score': 22.549559841071538}
