The solution is evaluated based on Intersection over Union (IoU) between the predicted binary mask and the ground truth mask.

IoU is computed as the area of overlap divided by the area of union between the two masks.

The final score is calculated as IoU × 100.

A score of 80 or higher (i.e., IoU ≥ 0.80) is considered a passing solution.
