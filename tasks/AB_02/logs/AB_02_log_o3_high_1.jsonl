Provide a top-level "config" object whose structure matches the $defs.CodeSolutionOutput schema.  That means the object must contain two required string members: "reasoning" and "solution_code".\n3. The embedded "solution_code" string must hold the complete, runnable Python program that implements watershed segmentation on the hard-coded file path images/8_of_hearts.png and returns a binary mask.\n4. The embedded "reasoning" string (inside config) must explain, step-by-step, how the code fulfils each implementation requirement.\n\nThe following JSON fulfils all of the above constraints.', config=CodeSolutionOutput(reasoning="Step-by-step explanation of the Watershed segmentation pipeline implemented in the code:\n\n1. Image loading – The function segment_image() tries to read the picture from the hard-coded path 'images/8_of_hearts.png' with cv2.imread.  If reading fails, it returns None so the caller immediately knows there was an I/O problem.\n\n2. Grayscale conversion – Watershed needs single–channel data for thresholding, so we convert the BGR image returned by OpenCV to gray with cv2.cvtColor.\n\n3. Binary inverse Otsu threshold – cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 255, THRESH_BINARY_INV | THRESH_OTSU) converts the white background to black (0) and the red symbols to white (255).  Using Otsu automatically selects the best threshold value.\n\n4. Morphological opening – A 3×3 kernel is applied twice (iterations=2) to remove isolated noise pixels that may have been produced by thresholding while leaving the bigger card symbols intact.\n\n5. Sure background – We obtain a background mask by dilating the cleaned-up binary image three times.  Dilation guarantees that the background region really covers everything that is certainly background.\n\n6. Sure foreground – We run cv2.distanceTransform on the cleaned-up binary image, then threshold at 70 % of the maximum distance.  Pixels above that value are well inside each object and are marked as sure foreground.\n\n7. Unknown zone – The pixels that are in the sure background but not in the sure foreground are considered unknown.  They form the watershed ‘valleys’ where the algorithm will cut the regions apart.\n\n8. Marker labelling – cv2.connectedComponents assigns a unique integer (>0) to each foreground blob.  We then add 1 to every label so that the background becomes 1 instead of 0 (OpenCV watershed needs background ≥1).  Unknown pixels get the label 0 so Watershed knows they have to be resolved.\n\n9. Watershed – cv2.watershed is executed on the original colour image together with our marker matrix.  After completion, marker = –1 marks the final region boundaries, marker > 1 indicates foreground regions and marker == 1 indicates background.\n\n10. Mask extraction – We build a blank uint8 mask and write 255 wherever markers > 1 (all foreground objects).  Boundaries (–1) and background (1) remain 0.\n\n11. Return value – The binary mask (uint8, foreground = 255, background = 0) is returned to the caller.  The function never saves or shows any files, exactly as the task demands.\n\nAll mandatory operations (threshold, morphology, distance transform, connectedComponents, *cv2.watershed*) appear in precisely the order requested, and the code contains the required error handling and no I/O other than the single image read.", solution_code='import cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\n\ndef segment_image():\n    """Segment hearts and numerals from \'images/8_of_hearts.png\' with Watershed.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    mask : numpy.ndarray or None\n        Binary mask (uint8) where foreground is 255 and background/borders are 0.\n        Returns None if the image cannot be loaded.\n    """\n    img_path = \'images/8_of_hearts.png\'\n\n    # 1.
