Import libraries\n   import cv2 and numpy as np – OpenCV supplies the watershed, morphology, thresholding and distance-transform functions, while NumPy is used for array manipulations and kernels.\n\n2. Hard-coded image loading\n   The segment_image function starts by reading 'images/8_of_hearts.png'.  If cv2.imread fails, the function returns None as a basic error-handling measure.\n\n3. Convert to grayscale\n   Watershed works on single-channel data for the pre-processing stages, so the BGR image is converted to grayscale.\n\n4. Global Otsu binary threshold (inverse)\n   cv2.threshold(..., THRESH_BINARY_INV + THRESH_OTSU) turns the light card background into black (0) and the red hearts / numerals into white (255).  The inversion is important because later distance-transform requires foreground to be non-zero.\n\n5. Morphological opening (noise removal)\n   A 3×3 kernel is used with two iterations to eliminate tiny speckles that could be mis-classified as independent markers.\n\n6. Sure background\n   Further dilation of the cleaned binary image (three iterations) guarantees that everything definitely belonging to the background is covered.\n\n7. Sure foreground\n   • A Euclidean distance transform (cv2.DIST_L2, mask size 5) is run on the cleaned binary image.\n   • Pixels whose distance is at least 70 % of the global maximum distance are kept – this leaves only the central regions of the hearts/numerals where we are very confident they belong to the objects.\n\n8. Unknown region\n   The difference between the sure background and sure foreground gives the “unknown” border zone that Watershed will resolve.\n\n9. Connected-components labelling\n   cv2.connectedComponents on the sure foreground assigns a unique integer label to each separated heart or numeral.  These labels are then incremented by one (so that background becomes label 1).\n   All unknown pixels are set to 0, fulfilling OpenCV’s Watershed marker convention.\n\n10. Watershed segmentation (mandatory core step)\n    cv2.watershed is applied to the original 3-channel colour image together with the prepared marker matrix.  After running, boundary pixels are assigned label −1, object interiors keep positive labels (>1), and background is 1.\n\n11. Generating the final binary mask\n    A zero-initialised uint8 mask is created.  Pixels whose final marker value is larger than 1 are marked foreground (255).  Boundaries (−1), background (1) and unknown (0) stay 0.\n\n12. Return value\n    The function returns this mask array (uint8, 0/255).  No images are shown or written to disk, complying with the output specifications.\n\nThis pipeline exactly mirrors the list of required operations and crucially uses cv2.watershed for segmentation.", solution_code='import cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\n\ndef segment_image():\n    """Segment hearts and numerals from \'images/8_of_hearts.png\' using Watershed.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    np.ndarray or None\n        Binary mask (uint8) where foreground == 255 and background == 0.\n        Returns None if the image cannot be read.\n    """\n\n    img_path = \'images/8_of_hearts.png\'\n    img = cv2.imread(img_path)\n    if img is None:\n        # Image not found or cannot be opened\n        return None\n\n    # 1.
