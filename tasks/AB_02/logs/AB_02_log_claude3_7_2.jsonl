The Watershed algorithm is particularly useful for this task as it can separate objects that are touching. Let me approach this step by step, following the required implementation steps.", config=CodeSolutionOutput(reasoning='To implement the Watershed algorithm for segmenting the playing card image, I\'ll follow these steps:\n\n1. First, I\'ll load the image from the specified path \'images/8_of_hearts.png\' and convert it to grayscale. This simplifies the initial processing by reducing the image to a single channel.\n\n2. I\'ll apply thresholding to separate potential foreground and background. Since we\'re dealing with a high-contrast image (red objects on white background), Otsu\'s thresholding with THRESH_BINARY_INV will work well to identify the dark objects.\n\n3. To clean up the thresholded image, I\'ll apply morphological opening which will remove small noise while preserving the shape of the larger objects (hearts and numerals).\n\n4. Next, I need to identify the "sure background" area by dilating the image. This expansion ensures that the background is well-defined.\n\n5. For the "sure foreground" identification, I\'ll use distance transform. This calculates how far each foreground pixel is from the background. Pixels with high distance values are definitely foreground (far from any background).\n\n6. By thresholding the distance transform at 70% of its maximum value, I can isolate the areas that are certainly foreground objects.\n\n7. The "unknown" region will be identified as the difference between the sure background and sure foreground - these are boundary regions that need to be resolved by watershed.\n\n8. I\'ll use connected components labeling on the sure foreground to mark distinct objects with different integer labels.\n\n9. I\'ll prepare markers for watershed by adding 1 to the labels (to ensure background is 1, not 0) and setting the unknown region to 0, which is the area watershed will work on.\n\n10. Finally, I\'ll apply the cv2.watershed algorithm on the original color image with our prepared markers. The watershed algorithm will assign the unknown region pixels to the appropriate segment.\n\n11. From the watershed result, I\'ll create a final binary mask where all foreground objects (hearts and numerals) are white (255) and the background is black (0).\n\nThis approach handles the segmentation problem effectively because:\n- The thresholding provides a good initial separation\n- Morphological operations clean up noise and improve object definitions\n- The distance transform helps identify object cores that are definitely foreground\n- The watershed algorithm resolves the ambiguous regions and provides clean boundaries', solution_code='import cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef segment_image():\n    # Load the image directly from the hardcoded path\n    try:\n        img = cv2.imread(\'images/8_of_hearts.png\')\n        if img is None:\n            print("Error: Could not load image from \'images/8_of_hearts.png\'")\n            return None\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f"Error loading image: {e}")\n        return None\n    \n    # Convert to grayscale\n    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n    \n    # Apply thresholding\n    _, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV | cv2.THRESH_OTSU)\n    \n    # Noise removal using morphological opening\n    kernel = np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8)\n    opening = cv2.morphologyEx(thresh, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel, iterations=2)\n    \n    # Sure background area - dilate the image\n    sure_bg = cv2.dilate(opening, kernel, iterations=3)\n    \n    # Finding sure foreground area using distance transform\n    dist_transform = cv2.distanceTransform(opening, cv2.DIST_L2, 5)\n    \n    # Calculate threshold as 70% of the maximum distance\n    _, sure_fg = cv2.threshold(dist_transform, 0.7 * dist_transform.max(), 255, 0)\n    sure_fg = np.uint8(sure_fg)\n    \n    # Finding unknown region (sure_bg - sure_fg)\n    unknown = cv2.subtract(sure_bg, sure_fg)\n    \n    # Marker labelling\n    _, markers = cv2.connectedComponents(sure_fg)\n    \n    # Add 1 to all labels so that background is 1, not 0\n    markers = markers + 1\n    \n    # Mark the unknown region with 0\n    markers[unknown == 255] = 0\n    \n    # Apply watershed algorithm\n    cv2.watershed(img, markers)\n    \n    # Create the final binary mask from watershed result\n    # Foreground objects will be 255 (white), background and boundaries will be 0 (black)\n    final_mask = np.zeros_like(gray, dtype=np.uint8)\n    final_mask[markers > 1] = 255  # All regions except background (1) and boundaries (-1)\n    \n    return final_mask\n')), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'solution_code_extracted': True, 'ground_truth_loaded': True, 'solution_function_loaded': True, 'prediction_mask_generated': True, 'iou_score': np.float64(0.8336422896720309), 'pass_threshold': 0.8, 'temp_file_cleaned': True}, 'score': 83.36422896720309}
