The steps are:\n1. Load the color image and exit if loading fails.\n2. Convert to grayscale for thresholding.\n3. Apply Otsu’s binary inverse threshold to separate foreground from background.\n4. Use morphological opening to clean noise.\n5. Dilate the opened image to obtain the sure background.\n6. Compute the distance transform of the opened image to find sure foreground by thresholding at 70% of its max value.\n7. Identify the unknown region by subtracting sure foreground from sure background.\n8. Label connected components in the sure foreground, shift labels by one so the background is labeled 1, and mark unknowns as 0.\n9. Run cv2.watershed on the original color image with those markers; watershed will label boundary pixels with -1.\n10.
