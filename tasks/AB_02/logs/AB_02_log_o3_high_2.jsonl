Image loading – The function `segment_image` loads the image from the **hard-coded** path `images/8_of_hearts.png`.  If loading fails, it returns `None` so that downstream code can react gracefully.\n\n2. Gray conversion – Watershed works on single-channel data when we create preliminary masks.  We therefore convert the BGR image to grayscale.\n\n3. Initial threshold – We apply Otsu’s adaptive threshold in an *inverse* binary mode (`THRESH_BINARY_INV`) so that the red symbols (hearts and the number 8) become white (255) and the white card background becomes black (0).  This gives us a rough foreground estimate.\n\n4. Noise cleaning – A 3×3 morphological **opening** is run twice to remove tiny speckles that Otsu may have mis-classified.\n\n5. Sure background – We dilate the cleaned mask three times.  Dilation makes sure every pixel that is not close to an object is certainly background.\n\n6. Sure foreground – The distance transform (`cv2.distanceTransform`) is computed from the cleaned binary mask.  Pixels that lie deeper inside objects have larger distance values.  We threshold this map at 70 % of its maximum value to keep only the innermost pixels – these are guaranteed foreground.\n\n7. Unknown area – Subtracting the sure foreground from the sure background yields an ‘unknown’ band that surrounds object borders.  Watershed will later label those pixels properly.\n\n8. Marker labelling – We call `cv2.connectedComponents` on the sure-foreground image.  Each connected blob gets a unique integer label (background = 0).  We add 1 to all labels so that background becomes 1 and real objects start at 2.  Unknown pixels are explicitly set to 0 to mark them as needing a decision.\n\n9. Watershed – The prepared marker image is passed, together with the **original colour image**, to `cv2.watershed`.  OpenCV will flood-fill from every marker and delineate touching objects; watershed borders are written back into the marker array with the value −1.\n\n10. Final binary mask – All pixels whose final marker value is larger than 1 belong to segmented objects.  They are written as 255 in an 8-bit mask; every other pixel (background or watershed ridge) is 0.  The function finally returns this mask.\n\nThe algorithm therefore strictly follows the sequence demanded by the assignment, uses `cv2.watershed` as the core segmentation step, employs only OpenCV / NumPy, and contains no file I/O or UI calls besides the mandatory image read.', solution_code='import cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\n\ndef segment_image():\n    """Segment the hearts and numeral 8 symbols from the background of\n    images/8_of_hearts.png using OpenCV\'s watershed algorithm.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    numpy.ndarray or None\n        Binary mask (uint8) with foreground = 255, background = 0.\n        Returns None if the image cannot be loaded.\n    """\n\n    # 1.
