We hardcode the image path, convert to grayscale, apply Otsu’s threshold (inverted) to separate foreground from background, clean up small noise with morphological opening, find sure background by dilation, find sure foreground via distance transform and thresholding at 70% of the max distance, compute the unknown region, label connected components of the sure foreground, prepare the marker image (increment labels, set unknown to zero), apply cv2.watershed on the original color image, and finally build a binary mask where all watershed pixels belonging to true objects (marker>1) are set to 255. The function returns this mask or None on load failure.', config=CodeSolutionOutput(reasoning="Step-by-step code explanation:\n1. Load the color image from 'images/8_of_hearts.png'. If loading fails, return None.\n2. Convert the loaded image to grayscale for thresholding operations.\n3. Apply Otsu’s thresholding with binary inversion (THRESH_BINARY_INV|THRESH_OTSU) to separate red shapes (foreground) as white on black.\n4. Remove small noise via morphological opening with a 3×3 kernel, 2 iterations.\n5. Dilate the opened image (3×3 kernel, 3 iterations) to get the sure background region.\n6. Compute the distance transform (L2) on the opened image and threshold it at 0.7×max(distance) to obtain the sure foreground.\n7. Convert sure foreground to uint8 and subtract it from sure background to find the unknown region.\n8. Label the sure foreground connected components with cv2.connectedComponents; increment labels by 1 so background=1.\n9. Mark the unknown region’s pixels as 0 in the marker array.\n10. Call cv2.watershed with the original color image and the markers; watershed will label boundary pixels with –1.\n11.
