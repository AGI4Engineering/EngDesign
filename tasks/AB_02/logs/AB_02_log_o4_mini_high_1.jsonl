Load the image from the hardcoded path 'images/8_of_hearts.png'. If loading fails, return None.\n2. Convert the loaded color image to grayscale for easier thresholding.\n3. Apply Otsu's thresholding in inverted binary mode to separate foreground shapes (hearts and numerals) from the white background.\n4. Perform morphological opening with a 3Ã—3 kernel to remove small noise artifacts.\n5. Dilate the opened result to obtain the sure background region.\n6. Compute the distance transform on the opened image to highlight the centers of foreground blobs.\n7. Threshold the distance-transformed image at 70% of its maximum to get the sure foreground region, then convert it to uint8.\n8. Subtract the sure foreground from the sure background to isolate the unknown region.\n9. Label connected components in the sure foreground to create initial markers, then increment labels so the background is 1, and set unknown pixels to 0.\n10. Apply OpenCV's cv2.watershed on the original color image with the prepared markers. Watershed will mark boundaries with -1 and assign labels to regions.\n11.
