{'completion_tokens': 2034, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The task is to navigate a 2x2 robot on a 30x30 grid from a starting point (17,2) to visit two goals, A (5,20) and B (25,24), in any order. The robot must avoid static rectangular obstacles and three moving pedestrians whose trajectories are given. The robot's maximum speed is 2 units in x and 2 units in y per time step.\n\nStrategy:\n1.  **Parse Environment**: The grid dimensions, static obstacle locations, and pedestrian trajectories (for t=0 to t=29) are defined. Robot and pedestrian sizes are 2x2.\n    - Static Obstacles: O1: ((5,0)-(7,15)), O2: ((10,20)-(20,30)), O3: ((15,5)-(30,10)). When considering the 2x2 robot, its bottom-left corner (rx,ry) means it occupies cells [rx, rx+2) x [ry, ry+2). An obstacle (ox1,oy1)-(ox2,oy2) occupies [ox1,ox2)x[oy1,oy2).\n    - Pedestrians: Their bottom-left positions (px,py) at each time t are given. They occupy [px,px+2)x[py,py+2).\n2.  **Collision Checking**: \n    - Static: Collision if robot's occupied area overlaps with any static obstacle's area.\n    - Dynamic: Collision if robot's occupied area at time t overlaps with any pedestrian's occupied area at time t. This is true if abs(rx-px) < 2 and abs(ry-py) < 2.\n    - Boundary: Robot's bottom-left (rx,ry) must satisfy 0 <= rx <= 28 and 0 <= ry <= 28.\n3.  **Goal Order**: Two possible sequences: Start->A->B or Start->B->A. A preliminary assessment suggested S->A->B might be shorter or fit better within the t=0-29 timeframe of pedestrian data. The path S->A->B was explored.\n4.  **Path Planning (Manual/Guided A* approach for S->A->B)**:\n    A path was constructed step-by-step, ensuring each step adheres to the speed limit (max |dx| <= 2, max |dy| <= 2) and avoids collisions.\n    *   **Segment 1: Start (17,2) to Goal A (5,20)**\n        -   t=0, current=(17,2).\n        -   To avoid O3 ([15,30)x[5,10)), move left first: (17,2) -> (15,2) -> (13,2). At t=2, pos=(13,2). Robot occupies [13,15)x[2,4), clear of O3.\n        -   To avoid O2 ([10,20)x[20,30)) while moving towards A=(5,20), move up from (13,2) to (13,18). At (13,18), robot occupies [13,15)x[18,20). This is below O2's y-range [20,30) if x overlaps. (t=2 to t=10, reaching (13,18)).\n        -   Move left from (13,18) to (5,18). At t=14, pos=(5,18). Robot occupies [5,7)x[18,20). This is clear of O1 ([5,7)x[0,15)) due to y-separation, and clear of O2 due to x-separation.\n        -   Move up from (5,18) to (5,20) (Goal A). At t=15, pos=(5,20). Robot occupies [5,7)x[20,22). Clear of O1 and O2.\n    *   **Segment 2: Goal A (5,20) at t=15 to Goal B (25,24)**\n        -   Current=(5,20) at t=15. To move towards B=(25,24), must pass O2 ([10,20)x[20,30)). Moving directly right at y=20 (e.g. to (9,20)) would cause collision with O2.\n        -   Move down from (5,20) to (5,18) to create vertical clearance from O2. At t=16, pos=(5,18). Robot [5,7)x[18,20).\n        -   Move right from (5,18) to (25,18). This path is clear of O1, O2, O3. At t=26, pos=(25,18). Robot [25,27)x[18,20).\n        -   Move up from (25,18) to (25,24) (Goal B). At t=29, pos=(25,24). Robot [25,27)x[24,26). Clear of O2 and O3.\n5.  **Verification**: The constructed path starts at (17,2) at t=0, reaches (5,20) at t=15, and (25,24) at t=29. All movements adhere to speed limits. Static and dynamic collision checks were performed for the chosen path points (implicitly, an A* would do this exhaustively; for manual, key points and obstacle interactions were checked). The path completes within t=29, matching pedestrian data availability.\n\nThe final path consists of points (t, x, y).", config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=15, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=13, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=13, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=13, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=13, y=8), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=13, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=13, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=13, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=13, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=13, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=11, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=9, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=7, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=5, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=5, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=5, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=7, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=9, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=11, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=20, x=13, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=21, x=15, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=22, x=17, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=23, x=19, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=24, x=21, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=25, x=23, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=26, x=25, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=27, x=25, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=28, x=25, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=29, x=25, y=24)])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'Start position correct': True, 'Hit Goal A': True, 'Hit Goal B': True, 'Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'Over Speed limit': False}, 'score': 100}
