Turn north while still east of the vertical static obstacle ((5,0),(7,15)).\n   – Rise two rows per tick up to y=14 (t=10).\n4. Go one cell east to x=9 at t=11 (avoids ped-1 that is at (7,15)).\n5. Slide west across the top of the vertical obstacle (y=16>15) until x=4 (t=13).\n6. Climb to y=20 and slide one cell east to (5,20) at t=16 → Goal-A reached.\n7. Drop two rows to y=18 (below obstacle-2’s bottom edge) and travel east along the clear corridor y=18 (t=17-26).\n   – This keeps us south of the big top obstacle ((10,20),(20,30)) and north of the low obstacle ((15,5),(30,10)).\n   – All pedestrian tracks are either far south (ped-3 early) or at y≈11 (ped-1) or at x<6 (ped-2) when we pass.\n8.
