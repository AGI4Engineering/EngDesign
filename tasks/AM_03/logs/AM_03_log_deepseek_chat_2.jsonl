{'completion_tokens': 1129, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To solve this problem, we need to navigate the robot from its starting position at (17, 2) to both Goal A (5, 20) and Goal B (25, 24) without colliding with static obstacles or pedestrians, while adhering to the speed limit. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Environment**: The map is a 30x30 grid with three static obstacles and three pedestrians moving along predefined paths. The robot and pedestrians are 2x2 in size, meaning we need to avoid any overlap in their positions.\n\n2. **Static Obstacles**: The obstacles are rectangles defined by their bottom-left and top-right corners. We need to ensure the robot's path does not intersect these areas.\n\n3. **Pedestrian Paths**: Pedestrians move along specific trajectories. We need to check the robot's position at each time step to ensure it doesn't overlap with any pedestrian's position.\n\n4. **Speed Limit**: The robot can move at most 2 units in either the x or y direction (or a combination) between time steps.\n\n5. **Path Planning**: We need to find a path that:\n   - Starts at (17, 2) at t=0.\n   - Visits both Goal A and Goal B in any order.\n   - Avoids obstacles and pedestrians.\n   - Adheres to the speed limit.\n\n6. **Strategy**: Given the positions of the obstacles and pedestrians, a viable path is to first move towards Goal A, avoiding the central obstacle, then proceed to Goal B, staying clear of the other obstacles and pedestrians.\n\n7. **Execution**: The robot's trajectory is planned as follows:\n   - From (17, 2), move upwards and to the left to approach Goal A, avoiding the central obstacle.\n   - After reaching Goal A, navigate around the top-right obstacle to reach Goal B.\n   - Ensure at each step that the robot's 2x2 area does not overlap with any pedestrian's current position or the static obstacles.\n\n8. **Verification**: Each step is checked for collisions and speed compliance. The final trajectory is a list of (t, x, y) positions that meet all constraints.", config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=16, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=15, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=14, y=8), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=13, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=12, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=11, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=10, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=9, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=8, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=7, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=6, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=5, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=6, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=7, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=8, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=9, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=10, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=11, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=12, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=20, x=13, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=21, x=14, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=22, x=15, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=23, x=16, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=24, x=17, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=25, x=18, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=26, x=19, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=27, x=20, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=28, x=21, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=29, x=22, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=30, x=23, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=31, x=24, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=32, x=25, y=24)])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'error': 'list index out of range'}, 'score': None}
