The robot (size 2×2) must keep its whole footprint outside these ranges.\n2. Pedestrians – their 2×2 footprints are taken from the given tables.  A time-synchronised check shows plenty of clearance if we keep roughly to the centre corridor, go to Goal A first, then skirt below the top obstacle and head right to Goal B.\n3. Speed limit – every move was crafted so that |Δx| ≤ 2 and |Δy| ≤ 2 between consecutive seconds.\n4. Collision test – each time-step was inspected; the robot’s footprint never overlaps any pedestrian or static obstacle (including shared edge cases), and it always stays inside the 30×30 map.\n5. Goals – the path reaches Goal A (5,20) at t = 14 and Goal B (25,24) at t = 28.\n6. The previous reply failed JSON validation because of inline comments; they have been removed below.
