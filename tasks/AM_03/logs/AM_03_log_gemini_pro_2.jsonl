{'completion_tokens': 1488, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The problem requires navigating a 2x2 robot on a 30x30 grid from a start position (17,2) to two goals, A (5,20) and B (25,24), in any order, while avoiding static obstacles and moving pedestrians (also 2x2). The robot has a speed limit of 2 units in x and 2 units in y per time step.\n\nStep-by-step solution approach:\n1.  **State Representation**: A state is defined as `(t, x, y)`, where `t` is the time in seconds, and `(x, y)` are the coordinates of the robot\'s bottom-left corner.\n2.  **Collision Checking**: A function `is_valid_state(t, x, y)` checks if the robot at `(x,y)` at time `t` is valid. This involves:\n    *   **Map Boundaries**: Ensuring `0 <= x <= 28` and `0 <= y <= 28` (since robot is 2x2 and grid is 30x30, so max coordinate for bottom-left is 28).\n    *   **Static Obstacles**: Checking for overlap between the robot\'s footprint `[x, x+2) x [y, y+2)` and any of the three static obstacles: `((5,0),(7,15))`, `((10,20),(20,30))`, `((15,5),(30,10))`. An overlap occurs if `rx1 < ox2 AND rx2 > ox1 AND ry1 < oy2 AND ry2 > oy1`.\n    *   **Pedestrians**: Checking for overlap with any of the three pedestrians at time `t`. Pedestrian positions are given for `t` from 0 to 29. If `t >= 30`, pedestrians are no longer considered. Overlap check is similar to static obstacles, using pedestrian\'s position `(px, py)` at time `t` to define its footprint `[px, px+2) x [py, py+2)`.\n3.  **Pathfinding Algorithm**: The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest-time path between two points. \n    *   **Nodes**: `(t, x, y)`.\n    *   **Cost (g-score)**: The time `t` to reach the node.\n    *   **Heuristic (h-score)**: Manhattan distance `abs(x - goal_x) + abs(y - goal_y)` to the current segment\'s goal.\n    *   **Neighbors**: From `(t, x, y)`, neighbors are `(t+1, x+dx, y+dy)` where `dx, dy` are in `{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}`. Only valid neighbor states are considered.\n4.  **Multi-Goal Strategy**: Two scenarios are evaluated:\n    *   Scenario 1: Start -> Goal A -> Goal B.\n        *   Path P1_A = A*(start_pos, t=0, Goal A_pos)\n        *   If P1_A found, Path P1_B = A*(Goal A_pos, t_at_A, Goal B_pos)\n    *   Scenario 2: Start -> Goal B -> Goal A.\n        *   Path P2_B = A*(start_pos, t=0, Goal B_pos)\n        *   If P2_B found, Path P2_A = A*(Goal B_pos, t_at_B, Goal A_pos)\n5.  **Path Selection**: The complete path (e.g., P1_A combined with P1_B) that reaches the final goal in the minimum total time is chosen. If one scenario fails to find a path, the other is used. If both fail, no solution is found (though the problem implies a solution exists).\n6.  **Output Format**: The final trajectory is a list of `{"t": time, "x": x_coord, "y": y_coord}` objects.\n\nApplying this methodology, a path was found. The chosen path is Start -> Goal A -> Goal B. The robot reaches Goal A at t=11 and Goal B at t=22.', config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=15, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=13, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=11, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=9, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=7, y=8), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=7, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=7, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=7, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=7, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=5, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=5, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=5, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=7, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=9, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=11, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=13, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=15, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=17, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=19, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=20, x=21, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=21, x=23, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=22, x=25, y=24)])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'Start position correct': True, 'Hit Goal A': True, 'Hit Goal B': True, 'Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'Over Speed limit': False}, 'score': 100}
