{'completion_tokens': 724, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To navigate the robot from the starting position (17, 2) to the goals A (5, 20) and B (25, 24) without collisions, we need to consider both static obstacles and moving pedestrians. The robot's speed limit is 2 units per time step in both x and y directions.\n\n1. **Initial Position and Goals**: The robot starts at (17, 2). It needs to reach both goals A (5, 20) and B (25, 24). The order of reaching these goals is flexible.\n\n2. **Static Obstacles**: The robot must avoid the following static obstacles:\n   - ((5, 0), (7, 15))\n   - ((10, 20), (20, 30))\n   - ((15, 5), (30, 10))\n\n3. **Pedestrian Paths**: The robot must avoid collisions with pedestrians 'ped1', 'ped2', and 'ped3', whose paths are given for each second from t=0 to t=29.\n\n4. **Path Planning**:\n   - **Step 1**: Move from (17, 2) to Goal A (5, 20). This involves moving upwards and leftwards while avoiding static obstacles and pedestrians.\n   - **Step 2**: Move from Goal A (5, 20) to Goal B (25, 24). This involves moving rightwards and upwards, again avoiding obstacles and pedestrians.\n\n5. **Collision Avoidance**:\n   - Ensure the robot's 2x2 size does not overlap with any static obstacles or pedestrian positions at any time.\n   - Check each time step to ensure the robot's path does not intersect with pedestrian paths.\n\n6. **Speed Limit**: Ensure the robot does not exceed the speed limit of 2 units per time step in either direction.\n\nBy following these steps, we can generate a collision-free trajectory for the robot.", config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=17, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=17, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=17, y=8), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=17, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=17, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=17, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=17, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=15, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=13, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=11, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=9, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=7, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=5, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=7, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=9, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=11, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=13, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=15, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=17, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=20, x=19, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=21, x=21, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=22, x=23, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=23, x=25, y=24)])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Start position correct': True, 'Hit Goal A': True, 'Hit Goal B': True, 'Number of collisions with static obstacles': 12, 'Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'Over Speed limit': False}, 'score': 75}
