## Task Description
Your task is to navigate a robot around static obstacles and walking pedestrians. 
The map is a 30 by 30 grid. The origin, i.e. (x,y) = (0,0), is at the bottom left of the grid.
x-axis grows to the right and y-axis grows upwards.

There are three static rectangular obstacles formatted in ((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) that describe the
bottom left and top right corners of the obstacle box:
[
    ((5, 0), (7, 15)),
    ((10,20), (20,30)),
    ((15, 5), (30, 10))
]

There are pedestrians walking around and their trajectory is 
stored as a list of tuples (t, x, y), where t is number of seconds from 0 to 29, 
and x and y are the coordinates of the bottom left corner in the grid.
The pedestrians and robots are both 2 by 2 in size.
Their paths are as follows:
'ped1': [   (0,1,1),
            (1,1,2),
            (2,1,4),
            (3,1,6),

The robot must start at (17, 2), and hit goals A and B one after another in any order. 
Goal A is positioned at (5, 20) and Goal B at (25, 24).

You must provide a list of tuples in (t,x,y) format that is free of collisions from
both pedestrians and static rectangular obstacles. 

The speed limit of robot in either x and y direction is 2 between each time step.
This means that the robot can move in the x direction 2 steps and y direction 2 steps and be ok.

You will be evaluated on the following:
- Starting position at t=0 is correct
- Hits Goal A at some point in time
- Hits Goal B at some point in time
- No collision between robot and static obstacles
- No collision between robot and walking pedestrians
- Does not exceed top speed
