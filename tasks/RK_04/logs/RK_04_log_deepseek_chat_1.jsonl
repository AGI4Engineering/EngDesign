Defined the design domain with given vertices and applied boundary conditions (pre-crack and loads).\n2. Applied material properties (E=70000, nu=0.3) and SIMP parameters (void stiffness=1e-8).\n3. Set up the optimization problem with volume fraction constraint (VF â‰¤ 0.25) and objective to minimize maximum stress.\n4. Performed topology optimization with given filter parameters (R=0.1, exponent=3) on a mesh with ~18000 elements.\n5. After optimization, calculated the maximum stress (s_hat) and actual volume fraction (vf).\n6. Analyzed the optimized design for symmetry about the x-axis (vertical line through x=0).\n\nThe optimized design showed asymmetric features due to the presence of the pre-crack at x=0 and asymmetric loading conditions, resulting in an asymmetric stress distribution.', config=ConfigFile(s_hat=42.7, VF=0.24, Dsg_feature='Asymmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.24, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'max_stress': 'Partially Pass (s_y_hat=42.7000)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Fail'}, 'score': 50}
