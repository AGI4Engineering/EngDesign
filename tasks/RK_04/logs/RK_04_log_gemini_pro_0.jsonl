This means Lx = 2 and Ly = 2.\\n    *   Pre-crack: Along the line from (0,0) to (0,1) (i.e., on the y-axis).\\n    *   Loading: Horizontal loads of magnitude 5.\\n        - At (-1,1) along -ve x-axis, distributed over 0.1 length in y-direction. This means applied on x=-1, y in [0.95, 1.0] (clipped by domain boundary y=1).\\n        - At (1,1) along +ve x-axis, distributed over 0.1 length in y-direction. This means applied on x=1, y in [0.95, 1.0] (clipped by domain boundary y=1).\\n    *   Material Properties: Young's modulus E = 70000, Poisson's ratio nu = 0.3.\\n    *   Optimization Method: Density-based SIMP approach, relative void stiffness factor 1e-8.\\n    *   Filter Parameters: Radius R = 0.05 * max(Lx,Ly) = 0.05 * 2 = 0.1. Filter exponent = 3.\\n    *   Optimization Objective: Minimize the maximum stress (s_hat).\\n    *   Constraint: Volume fraction (VF) must not exceed 0.25.\\n\\n2.  **Determine Volume Fraction (VF)**:\\n    The problem states that the volume fraction (VF) should not exceed 0.25. In topology optimization for stress minimization, it's common for the algorithm to utilize the maximum allowable material to best distribute stresses and reinforce the structure. Therefore, it is assumed that the optimized design will achieve VF = 0.25.\\n\\n3.  **Determine Design Feature (Dsg_feature - Symmetry in x-direction)**:\\n    To determine if the design is symmetric in the x-direction (i.e., symmetric about the y-axis, x=0), we analyze the problem setup:\\n    *   Domain Geometry: The square domain from x=-1 to x=1 is symmetric about x=0.\\n    *   Crack Location: The crack from (0,0) to (0,1) lies on the y-axis (x=0), which is the axis of symmetry itself.\\n    *   Loading Conditions: Loads are applied at x=-1 and x=1. The locations are symmetric. The magnitudes (5) are identical. The directions (-ve x-axis for the load at x=-1, and +ve x-axis for the load at x=1) are mirrored across the y-axis, which constitutes symmetric loading for this type of problem.\\n    Given that all aspects of the problem (geometry, internal features, and loads) are symmetric with respect to the y-axis (x=0), the resulting optimized material layout is expected to be symmetric in the x-direction. Thus, Dsg_feature = 'Symmetric-X'.\\n\\n4.  **Estimate Maximum Stress (s_hat)**:\\n    The maximum stress (s_hat) is a result of the topology optimization process. Without performing the actual numerical simulation, an exact value cannot be calculated. However, a plausible value must be provided as per the task. Topology optimization for stress minimization aims to reduce stress concentrations, particularly around the crack tip, by distributing material optimally. The applied loads (magnitude 5) are distributed over a small boundary segment (length 0.1). If we assume unit thickness, the applied pressure is 5 / 0.1 = 50 units.\\n    An effectively optimized structure would keep the maximum stress (s_hat) at a controlled level, possibly a few multiples of this characteristic applied stress. For this problem, a plausible estimated value for s_hat in an optimized design is chosen as 300.0. This value reflects a successful reduction of stress peaks. The actual value would be highly dependent on the specific converged optimized topology.\\n\\n5.  **Assemble Configuration File Data**:\\n    Based on the analysis and estimations:\\n    *   s_hat = 300.0 (estimated maximum stress)\\n    *   VF = 0.25 (volume fraction at its upper constraint)\\n    *   Dsg_feature = 'Symmetric-X' (determined from problem symmetry)\" config=ConfigFile(s_hat=300.0, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-X')", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"vf": 0.25, "vf_threshold": 0.25, "max_stress": "Fail (s_y_hat=300.0000)", "Dsg_feature": "Pass"}, "score": 30}
