Given the symmetric nature of the problem (symmetric loading, domain, and a pre-crack along the axis of symmetry), the optimized design would also be symmetric about the y-axis. This makes the design feature 'Symmetric-X'. For the volume fraction, since we're minimizing maximum stress, the optimizer would use all available material up to the constraint, resulting in VF = 0.25. The maximum stress (s_hat) value would be reduced through optimization but would still be influenced by the stress concentration at the crack tip, estimated at approximately 350 based on the given material properties and loading conditions.", config=ConfigFile(s_hat=350.0, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'max_stress': 'Fail (s_y_hat=350.0000)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Pass'}, 'score': 30}
