The design domain has a pre-crack and is subjected to horizontal loads. The material properties and SIMP approach parameters are defined. The optimized design is evaluated for maximum stress (s_hat) and volume fraction (VF). Finally, the design is assessed for symmetry along the x-axis to determine its 'Dsg_feature'.
