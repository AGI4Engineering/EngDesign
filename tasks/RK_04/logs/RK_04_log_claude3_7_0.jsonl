However, the presence of the crack breaks the symmetry of the domain.\n\nFor this specific problem, the optimized design would likely be asymmetric in the x-direction because the crack creates an asymmetric stress distribution, and material would be placed to efficiently route loads around the crack.\n\nBased on similar topology optimization problems with cracks, the expected outcome would be:\n- s_hat (maximum stress) ≈ 120-140 units\n- VF (volume fraction) = 0.25 (hitting the constraint)\n- Dsg_feature = "Asymmetric-X" (due to the influence of the crack)', config=ConfigFile(s_hat=130.5, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Asymmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'max_stress': 'Partially Pass (s_y_hat=130.5000)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Fail'}, 'score': 50}
