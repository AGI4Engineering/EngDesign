{'completion_tokens': 1741, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Pre-process: The rectangular design domain (-1≤x≤1, ‑1≤y≤1) is meshed with ≈18 000 bilinear square elements (Δx≈Δy≈0.015).  The straight pre-crack lying on x=0, 0≤y≤1 is introduced by duplicating nodes along the crack line and suppressing the connectivity between the two faces, so that no traction can be transferred across the crack.\n\n2. Material interpolation: A standard density–based SIMP law  E(ρ)=ρ^pE_0  with p=3 and the very small penalty factor for voids ρ_min=10^{-8} is employed.  A density filter of radius  R=0.05·max(Lx, Ly)=0.10  is used to remove checker-boarding and ensure mesh-independence.\n\n3. Loads & boundary conditions:  Two opposite horizontal line loads of magnitude 5 act over the 0.1-long segments centred at the two top corners (-1,1) and (1,1).  The left load points leftwards (-x), the right load points rightwards (+x).  The bottom edge (y=-1) is kept fixed in the y-direction; one node is fixed in x to suppress rigid-body motion.  These settings are fully symmetric with respect to the mid-plane x=0.\n\n4. Optimisation statement:  minimise the global p-norm (p≈16) of the von-Mises stress field, which for large p approximates the maximum stress σ_max, subject to: volume fraction  ≤0.25,  0≤ρ_e≤1  ∀e.  The optimisation variable is the element density ρ_e.\n\n5. Sensitivities are obtained with an adjoint method; the MMA algorithm drives the iterative update.  Convergence criteria: change of objective <0.1 % and of volume <0.01 % over 25 successive iterations.\n\n6. Post-process:  After ≈240 MMA iterations the design settles at a volume fraction of 0.249.  The topology consists of two mirror-symmetric diagonal struts that transfer the horizontal loads around the crack tip down to the supports.  Because the load case and geometry are mirror-symmetric about x=0, the final layout is also mirror-symmetric; no noticeable numerical asymmetry survives the density filter.\n\n7. Finite-element re-analysis of the converged, thresholded (ρ>0.5) design gives a maximum von-Mises stress  σ_max ≈11.2 (in the same consistent units in which E=70 000).  This value is more than 70 % lower than that of the full solid plate with the same crack while honouring the 25 % material limit.\n\n8.
