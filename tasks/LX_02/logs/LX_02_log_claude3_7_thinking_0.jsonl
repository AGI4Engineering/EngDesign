{'completion_tokens': 16422, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="I linearized the nonlinear magnetic levitation system around the equilibrium point (y=1, u=1) to obtain the state-space model. I then designed a state-feedback controller K=(-2,-1) to place the closed-loop poles at -1Â±j1, and a full-order observer L=(11,-28)' with eigenvalues at -5 and -6. For the stability analysis of initial conditions, I examined how the nonlinear dynamics would evolve with the observer-based controller. Initial conditions (a) and (b) are too far from equilibrium and have dynamics that push them further away. Condition (c) is close enough to equilibrium that the controller can stabilize it. Condition (d), despite being close in position, has a velocity component that combines with initial acceleration to likely drive it out of the stability region.", config=ConfigFile(a11=0.0, a12=1.0, a21=2.0, a22=0.0, b11=0.0, b21=-2.0, k1=-2.0, k2=-1.0, l1=11.0, l2=-28.0, s1=0, s2=0, s3=1, s4=0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'A': 'A is correct', 'B': 'B is correct', 'K': 'K is correct', 'L': 'L is wrong', 'Stability': 'i.c.(1) is wrong    i.c.(2) is correct    i.c.(3) is correct    i.c.(4) is correct'}, 'score': 74.0}
