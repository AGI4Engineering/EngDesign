{'completion_tokens': 13098, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I linearized the magnetic levitation system around the operating point (1,1), finding the state-space matrices. I designed a feedback gain K=[-2 -1] to place the closed-loop poles at -1±j1, and an observer with gain L=[11 -28]ᵀ to place observer poles at -5 and -6. For stability analysis, I examined the nonlinear dynamics with the observer-based controller for each initial condition. Points (2,2) and (2.5,0) are too far from equilibrium, where magnetic force is too weak relative to gravity to recover. Points (0.8,0) and (0.9,-1) are close enough to equilibrium for the controller to stabilize the system.', config=ConfigFile(a11=0.0, a12=1.0, a21=2.0, a22=0.0, b11=0.0, b21=-2.0, k1=-2.0, k2=-1.0, l1=11.0, l2=-28.0, s1=0, s2=0, s3=1, s4=1)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'A': 'A is correct', 'B': 'B is correct', 'K': 'K is correct', 'L': 'L is wrong', 'Stability': 'i.c.(1) is wrong    i.c.(2) is correct    i.c.(3) is correct    i.c.(4) is wrong'}, 'score': 58.0}
