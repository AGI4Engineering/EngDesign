{'completion_tokens': 8276, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1) Linearizing  y¨ = 1 − (u² / y² )  about  y = 1 ,  u = 1  and letting x₁ = y , x₂ = ẏ  gives the system  ẋ₁ = x₂ ,  ẋ₂ = 1 − (u² / x₁² ).  Its Jacobian around  (x₁,x₂,u) = (1,0,1)  is  A = [[∂f₁/∂x₁, ∂f₁/∂x₂],[∂f₂/∂x₁, ∂f₂/∂x₂]]  ,  B = [[∂f₁/∂u],[∂f₂/∂u]].  Since f₁ = x₂ , f₂ = 1 − u² / x₁² , we get  ∂f₁/∂x₁ = 0 , ∂f₁/∂x₂ = 1 ,  ∂f₂/∂x₁ = 2u² / x₁³ = 2 , ∂f₂/∂x₂ = 0 ,  ∂f₁/∂u = 0 , ∂f₂/∂u = −2u / x₁² = −2 .  Evaluating at  (1,0,1)  yields:\n\nA = [ [0, 1], [2, 0] ],   B = [ [0], [−2] ].\n\n2) We want state feedback gain  K = (k₁  k₂)  such that the closed‐loop matrix  A − BK  has poles at  −1 ± j .  The desired characteristic polynomial is  s² + 2 s + 2 .  A − BK  = [ [0, 1], [2 + 2k₁, 2k₂] ].  Its characteristic equation is  s² − 2k₂ s − 2 − 2k₁  =  s² + 2 s + 2  , which gives  k₂ = −1 ,  k₁ = −2 .\n\n3) For an observer of full order, the output is y = x₁ .  Hence C = [1  0] .  We choose L so that  A − L C  has poles  −5 , −6 .  If  L = (l₁ , l₂)ᵀ ,  then  A − L C = [ [−l₁, 1], [2 − l₂, 0] ],  and its characteristic polynomial becomes  s² + l₁ s + (l₂−2).  Matching  s² + 11 s + 30  gives  l₁ = 11 ,  l₂ = 32 .\n\n4) With these gains and an observer initially at  (1,0),  the region of attraction about the equilibrium  (y=1,u=1)  can be tested numerically on the nonlinear model.  Typically  (2,2)  and  (2.5,0)  are too large a disturbance to converge, whereas  (0.8,0)  and  (0.9,−1)  remain within the basin of attraction.  Hence the yes/no indicators are  S₁=0 , S₂=0 , S₃=1 , S₄=1 .', config=ConfigFile(a11=0.0, a12=1.0, a21=2.0, a22=0.0, b11=0.0, b21=-2.0, k1=-2.0, k2=-1.0, l1=11.0, l2=32.0, s1=0, s2=0, s3=1, s4=1)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'A': 'A is correct', 'B': 'B is correct', 'K': 'K is correct', 'L': 'L is correct', 'Stability': 'i.c.(1) is wrong    i.c.(2) is correct    i.c.(3) is correct    i.c.(4) is wrong'}, 'score': 68.0}
