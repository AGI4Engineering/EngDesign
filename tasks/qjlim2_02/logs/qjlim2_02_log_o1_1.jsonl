{'completion_tokens': 1061, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A standard rule of thumb for a half-wave dipole at 3 GHz is to use a length of about half a free-space wavelength (λ/2), where λ≈100\xa0mm at 3 GHz. Adjusting slightly below λ/2 (approximately 0.48\xa0λ) often helps account for end effects and improves the impedance match. This leads to a length around 48 mm. Using a width of about one-tenth of that length (≈ 4.8 mm) keeps the antenna within the 100×100 mm space limit while providing an adequate bandwidth (>= 100 MHz) and a gain close to 2 dBi. The proposed dimensions therefore maintain S11 under –10 dB, achieve the specified bandwidth, and stay well within the size constraint.', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=48.0, width_mm=4.8)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.886, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.78233672900536, 'BandwidthMHz': 421.2, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.110537947555802}, 'score': 60.0}
