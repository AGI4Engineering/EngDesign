{'completion_tokens': 790, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To resonate at 3 GHz in free space, the total dipole length should be approximately half a wavelength: λ₀ = c/f = (3×10⁸ m/s)/(3×10⁹ Hz) = 0.1 m, so L ≃ λ₀/2 = 0.05 m = 50 mm. Each arm is λ₀/4 (25 mm), giving a total length of 50 mm.\n\nBandwidth can be increased by widening the strip. To maintain good S11 (≤–10 dB) over ≥100 MHz, a strip width around one-tenth of the length is typical. With L = 50 mm, W ≃ 5 mm is both ≤L/10 and helps achieve a wider impedance bandwidth. \n\nA 50 mm × 5 mm copper dipole easily fits within the 100 mm×100 mm envelope. Its radiation pattern and efficiency will yield a gain ≥2 dBi. \n\nThus the optimal parameters are:\n- length_mm = 50\n- width_mm = 5', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=50.0, width_mm=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.7348, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.47739884648448, 'BandwidthMHz': 381.6, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.0996047198610275}, 'score': 60.0}
