A half-wave dipole total length ≈ λ₀/2 ≈ 50 mm. This places the first resonance at 3 GHz (S11 ≤ –10 dB).\n3. To achieve at least 100 MHz bandwidth, the strip dipole arms are given some finite width. As a rule of thumb, width ≲ 1/10 of length both satisfies the design note and increases bandwidth.\n4. With length ≈ 50 mm, the maximum allowable width is 50 mm/10 = 5 mm. A 5 mm width gives a broad enough bandwidth while keeping the footprint under 100×100 mm.\n5. The resulting dipole (length = 50 mm, width = 5 mm) fits within the space constraint, resonates at 3 GHz with ≥ 100 MHz bandwidth, and achieves ≥ 2 dBi gain in free space.\n\nFinal design parameters:', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=50.0, width_mm=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.7348, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.47739884648448, 'BandwidthMHz': 381.6, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.0996047198610275}, 'score': 60.0}
