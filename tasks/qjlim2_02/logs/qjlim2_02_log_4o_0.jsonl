{'completion_tokens': 196, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design a strip dipole antenna that meets the given specifications, we need to consider the resonant frequency, bandwidth, gain, and space constraints. The resonant frequency of 3 GHz corresponds to a wavelength (λ) of 100 mm in free space. A half-wavelength dipole is typically used, so the length of the dipole should be approximately λ/2, which is 50 mm. \n\nThe width of the dipole should be at most 1/10 of the length, so a width of 5 mm is appropriate. This width will help achieve the desired bandwidth and gain while staying within the space constraints of 100 mm x 100 mm.\n\nThe confidence in this design is high because the length and width are chosen based on standard practices for dipole antennas, ensuring that the resonant frequency, bandwidth, and gain requirements are met.', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=50.0, width_mm=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.7348, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.47739884648448, 'BandwidthMHz': 381.6, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.0996047198610275}, 'score': 60.0}
