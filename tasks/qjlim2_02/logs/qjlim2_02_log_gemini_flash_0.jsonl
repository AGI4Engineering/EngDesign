{"completion_tokens": 219, "response": "reasoning='The length of a dipole antenna is approximately half of the wavelength at the resonant frequency. Given the resonant frequency of 3 GHz, the wavelength can be calculated as \u03bb = c / f, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s) and f is the frequency (3 GHz).  Therefore, \u03bb \u2248 100 mm. The length of the dipole antenna should be approximately \u03bb/2, which is 50 mm. To ensure that the space constraint is met, the antenna width should be at most 1/10 of the length, resulting in a width of 5 mm. I chose 48 and 4 respectively, to account for the effect of width on the resonant frequency. These dimensions should be able to achieve a bandwidth greater than 100 MHZ and gain above 2dBi.' config=ConfigFile(length_mm=48.0, width_mm=4.0)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"ResonantFrequencyGHz": 2.886, "S11_resonant_dB": -15.799364160135527, "BandwidthMHz": 398.4, "MaxGaindBi": 2.1053086401722347}, "score": 60.0}
