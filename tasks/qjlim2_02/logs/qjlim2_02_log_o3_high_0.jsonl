{'completion_tokens': 1109, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Centre frequency is 3 GHz → free–space wavelength λ = c / f ≈ 3·10^8 m s⁻¹ / 3·10^9 Hz = 0.1 m = 100 mm.\n2. A half-wave dipole resonates when its physical length is ≈ 0.45 – 0.5 λ.  Taking the commonly used 0.47 λ (accounts for end effects) gives L ≈ 0.47 × 100 mm ≈ 47 mm.\n3. The antenna must fit in 100 mm × 100 mm → 47 mm is well inside this limit.\n4. Bandwidth of a strip dipole increases with strip width.  A width of 3–5 mm is a practical compromise that:   • keeps w ≤ L/10 (specification)   • provides input impedance close to 73 Ω   • yields ≳10 % impedance bandwidth (≥300 MHz at 3 GHz, comfortably above the required 100 MHz).\n5. Choosing w = 4 mm gives w/L ≈ 0.085 (< 0.1), broadens bandwidth a little more than 3 mm, and is still electrically ‘thin’ so the classical dipole pattern and ≈ 2.1 dBi gain are retained.\n6. Expected performance with L = 47 mm, w = 4 mm:   • S11 ≤ –10 dB at 3 GHz (tuned by fine-trimming ±0.5 mm during fabrication)   • Impedance bandwidth ≳300 MHz (covers the 100 MHz requirement)   • Realised gain ≈ 2.1 dBi (meets ≥2 dBi goal).\n7. Therefore the selected dimensions satisfy all constraints (resonance, bandwidth, gain, and size).', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=47.0, width_mm=4.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.9472, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.801871486856355, 'BandwidthMHz': 409.2, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.105784898392777}, 'score': 78.88000000000002}
