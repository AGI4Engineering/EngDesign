{'completion_tokens': 5263, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a strip dipole antenna for 3 GHz, I need to calculate the appropriate dimensions that meet all requirements.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the wavelength at 3 GHz.\nλ = c/f = 299,792,458 / (3 × 10^9) = 0.0999 meters ≈ 99.9 mm\n\nStep 2: Determine the length of the dipole.\nA half-wavelength dipole would theoretically be λ/2 = 50 mm long. However, due to end effects and the width of the strip, the actual resonant length is typically shorter. For strip dipoles, a common approximation is around 0.47λ:\nLength ≈ 0.47 × 99.9 mm = 46.95 mm ≈ 47 mm\n\nStep 3: Determine the appropriate width.\nAccording to the constraint, the width should be at most 1/10 of the length.\nMaximum width = 47 mm / 10 = 4.7 mm\n\nSince wider strips generally provide broader bandwidth (which helps meet our 100 MHz bandwidth requirement), I'll choose a width close to but under this limit. A width of 4 mm will provide good bandwidth characteristics while staying within the width constraint.\n\nStep 4: Verify all requirements:\n- Resonant Frequency: The calculated dimensions will resonate at 3 GHz\n- Bandwidth: The width of 4 mm should provide enough bandwidth (≥100 MHz)\n- Gain: A half-wave dipole typically has a gain of about 2.15 dBi, meeting our ≥2 dBi requirement\n- Space Constraint: 47 mm × 4 mm is well within the 100 mm × 100 mm constraint\n- Width Constraint: 4 mm is less than 1/10 of 47 mm (4.7 mm)", config=ConfigFile(length_mm=47.0, width_mm=4.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.9472, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.801871486856355, 'BandwidthMHz': 409.2, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.105784898392777}, 'score': 78.88000000000002}
