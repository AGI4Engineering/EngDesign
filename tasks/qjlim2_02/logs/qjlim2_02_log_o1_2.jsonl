{'completion_tokens': 1871, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A standard half-wave strip dipole for 3 GHz has a physical length close to half of a free-space wavelength (which is about 100 mm). Thus, choosing about 48 mm ensures proper resonance at around 3 GHz. Making the strip width approximately 1/10 of the dipole length (about 4.8 mm) provides sufficient conductor thickness to achieve the required 100 MHz bandwidth (S11 ≤ –10 dB) and roughly 2 dBi gain. This design fits well within the 100 mm × 100 mm space constraint.', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=48.0, width_mm=4.8)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.886, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.78233672900536, 'BandwidthMHz': 421.2, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.110537947555802}, 'score': 60.0}
