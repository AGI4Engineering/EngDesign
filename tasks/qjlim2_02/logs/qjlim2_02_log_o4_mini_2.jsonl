{'completion_tokens': 1161, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Calculate free-space wavelength (λ0) at 3 GHz: λ0 = c/f = 3×10^8 m/s ÷ 3×10^9 Hz = 0.1 m = 100 mm.\n2. A half-wave dipole has electrical length ≃ λ0/2 = 50 mm per arm, or 100 mm total.  \n3. Include end-effect shortening: typical metallic dipoles resonate when their total length is 4–5% shorter than λ0, so 100 mm × (1 – ~0.05) ≃ 95 mm.\n4. Verify space constraint: 95 mm × width must fit within 100 mm × 100 mm – OK.\n5. Bandwidth enhancement: dipole bandwidth increases with element width up to roughly 1/10 of its length. To meet ≥100 MHz bandwidth, choose width at the upper bound of 1/10 length = 95 mm/10 = 9.5 mm.\n6. Verify gain: a standard half-wave strip dipole in free space typically yields ≃2.1 dBi, satisfying ≥2 dBi.\n\nFinal chosen dimensions:\n• Total length (metallic patch): 95 mm\n• Width: 9.5 mm', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=95.0, width_mm=9.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.4, 'S11_resonant_dB': -2.0230953355096446, 'BandwidthMHz': 0.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.9482325548297346}, 'score': 20.0}
