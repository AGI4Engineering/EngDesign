{'completion_tokens': 249, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design a strip dipole antenna that resonates at 3 GHz, we need to calculate the length of the dipole. The resonant length of a dipole antenna is typically around half the wavelength of the frequency it is designed to operate at. The wavelength (λ) can be calculated using the formula: λ = c / f, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s) and f is the frequency (3 GHz in this case). This gives us a wavelength of 100 mm, so the length of the dipole should be around 50 mm.\n\nThe width of the dipole should be at most 1/10 of the length, which means it should be around 5 mm. This ensures that the antenna maintains its dipole characteristics and operates efficiently.\n\nThese dimensions fit within the space constraint of 100 mm x 100 mm, and the design should meet the gain and bandwidth requirements given the typical performance of strip dipole antennas.\n\nConfidence in this design is high due to the straightforward nature of the calculations and the well-understood behavior of dipole antennas.', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=50.0, width_mm=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.7348, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.47739884648448, 'BandwidthMHz': 381.6, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.0996047198610275}, 'score': 60.0}
