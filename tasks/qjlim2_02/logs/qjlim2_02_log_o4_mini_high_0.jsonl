{'completion_tokens': 829, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. A half-wave dipole in free space resonates when its total length L ≃ λ/2. At f0=3 GHz, the free-space wavelength λ = c/f0 ≃ 300 mm/3 = 100 mm, so λ/2 = 50 mm.\n\n2. In practice, finite strip thickness and end effects shorten the electrical length slightly. A design length L ≃ 0.95·(λ/2) ≃ 0.95·50 mm ≃ 47.5 mm is often used to hit 3 GHz precisely. For ease of fabrication and tuning, we choose L = 50 mm total (±25 mm per arm), and fine-tune slightly during prototyping if needed.\n\n3. Bandwidth of a wire dipole is narrow (~1–2% fractional) but using a strip (wider conductor) increases bandwidth. A strip width w up to ~1/10 of L is recommended. Here, w ≤ 5 mm (since 5 mm = 0.1·50 mm). A 5 mm strip yields a broader bandwidth (>3\u2009% fractional, i.e. >90 MHz) which can meet the 100 MHz requirement with slight matching network or minor width increase.\n\n4. Gain of a straight half-wave dipole in free space is ≃2.15 dBi. Using a strip does not reduce gain, so our design meets ≥2 dBi.\n\n5. Space constraint 100 mm × 100 mm: our design (50 mm × 5 mm) easily fits.\n\n6. Conclusion: Set length_mm = 50 mm and width_mm = 5 mm. Prototype may be tuned by ±1 mm or matching stub for precise S11 ≤ –10 dB over a 100 MHz band around 3 GHz.', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=50.0, width_mm=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.7348, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.47739884648448, 'BandwidthMHz': 381.6, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.0996047198610275}, 'score': 60.0}
