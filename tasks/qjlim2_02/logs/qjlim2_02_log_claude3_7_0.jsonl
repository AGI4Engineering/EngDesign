Let me work through this step by step.\n\n1. First, I need to calculate the optimal length for a dipole antenna at 3 GHz.\n\nThe wavelength λ for an electromagnetic wave at frequency f is given by:\nλ = c/f\nwhere c is the speed of light (3×10^8 m/s)\n\nFor f = 3 GHz = 3×10^9 Hz:\nλ = 3×10^8 / 3×10^9 = 0.1 m = 100 mm\n\n2. For a standard half-wave dipole, the length should be λ/2:\nLength = 100/2 = 50 mm\n\nHowever, due to end effects and the finite width of the actual antenna, the physical length needs to be slightly shorter than the theoretical half-wavelength. The correction factor is typically around 0.95 for thin dipoles, making:\nCorrected length ≈ 50 × 0.95 ≈ 47.5 mm\n\n3. For the width determination, according to the note, the width should be at most 1/10 of the length. Since we've calculated a length of approximately 47.5 mm, the width should be:\nMaximum width = 47.5/10 = 4.75 mm\n\nI'll choose a width of 4.5 mm to be conservative and ensure good performance while meeting the constraint.\n\n4. Validation of the design parameters:\n   - Space constraint: Our design (47.5 mm × 4.5 mm) is well within the specified constraint of 100 mm × 100 mm.\n   - Resonant frequency: The calculated length should provide resonance at 3 GHz with S11 ≤ -10 dB.\n   - Bandwidth: A thin strip dipole with these dimensions should provide at least 100 MHz bandwidth around the 3 GHz center frequency.\n   - Gain: A properly designed dipole typically provides around 2.15 dBi gain, which meets the requirement of ≥ 2 dBi.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'm confident that a strip dipole with a length of 47.5 mm and width of 4.5 mm will meet all the specified requirements.", config=ConfigFile(length_mm=47.5, width_mm=4.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.916, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.80062189742166, 'BandwidthMHz': 418.8, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.1087250831829865}, 'score': 66.39999999999998}
