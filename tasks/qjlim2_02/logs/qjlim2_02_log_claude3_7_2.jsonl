{'completion_tokens': 493, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a strip dipole antenna for 3 GHz resonant frequency, I need to calculate the appropriate dimensions.\n\n1. First, let's calculate the wavelength at 3 GHz:\n   λ = c/f = 3×10^8 m/s ÷ 3×10^9 Hz = 0.1 m = 100 mm\n\n2. For a resonant dipole antenna, the total length is typically λ/2:\n   L = λ/2 = 100 mm/2 = 50 mm\n   \n   However, there's typically an end effect that makes the physical length slightly shorter than the theoretical length. The actual length is typically about 95% of the half-wavelength, so:\n   L = 0.95 × 50 mm = 47.5 mm\n\n3. For the width, as per the additional note, it should be at most 1/10 of the length:\n   W ≤ L/10 = 47.5 mm/10 = 4.75 mm\n   \n   I'll choose a width of 4 mm to satisfy this constraint while providing sufficient bandwidth.\n\n4. Verification against constraints:\n   - The length of 47.5 mm and width of 4 mm are well within the space constraint of 100 mm × 100 mm.\n   - At the resonant frequency of 3 GHz, this design should provide S11 ≤ -10 dB.\n   - The bandwidth should exceed 100 MHz as strip dipole antennas typically have good bandwidth characteristics.\n   - The gain should be around 2.15 dBi, which is the typical gain of a half-wave dipole in free space.\n\nTherefore, my design parameters are:\n- Length: 47.5 mm\n- Width: 4 mm", config=ConfigFile(length_mm=47.5, width_mm=4.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.9172, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.802292948515378, 'BandwidthMHz': 403.2, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.105806424140213}, 'score': 66.87999999999991}
