However, due to end effects, the actual physical length needs to be slightly shorter. Using a standard correction factor of 0.95 for dipole antennas:\nLength = 0.95 × (λ/2) = 0.95 × 50 mm = 47.5 mm\n\nStep 3: Determine the width of the strip.\nAccording to the constraint, the width should be at most 1/10 of the length:\nMaximum width = 47.5 mm / 10 = 4.75 mm\n\nI'll use a width of 4.7 mm to ensure we stay within this constraint while maximizing the bandwidth. A wider strip (within constraints) helps achieve the required bandwidth of ≥100 MHz.\n\nThis design will:\n- Resonate at 3 GHz (S11 ≤ -10 dB)\n- Provide a bandwidth of at least 100 MHz (typical half-wavelength dipoles provide 4-6% bandwidth, which at 3 GHz is 120-180 MHz)\n- Achieve a gain of at least 2 dBi (typical for a half-wavelength dipole)\n- Fit well within the space constraint of 100 mm × 100 mm\n- Maintain the width-to-length ratio constraint", config=ConfigFile(length_mm=47.5, width_mm=4.7)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.916, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.786748196142344, 'BandwidthMHz': 424.8, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.110082721273457}, 'score': 66.39999999999998}
