{"completion_tokens": 274, "response": "reasoning='To design a strip dipole antenna for 3 GHz, we need to determine the length and width of the metallic patch. The length is approximately half of the wavelength at the resonant frequency. The width is a fraction of the length, typically less than 1/10th of the length. \\n\\n1.  Calculate the wavelength:  \u03bb = c / f, where c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s) and f is the frequency (3 GHz).\\n2.  Determine the length: length \u2248 \u03bb / 2. Convert to millimeters.\\n3.  Determine the width: width <= length / 10. Choose a reasonable value, considering space constraints and impedance matching.\\n4.  Verify the constraints: Ensure length x width <= 100 mm x 100 mm.  Also, S11 <= -10 dB, Bandwidth >= 100 MHz, and Gain >= 2 dBi. These would usually be verified through simulation, which is outside the scope of this task, so we must rely on standard design practice to estimate the result.' config=ConfigFile(length_mm=48.0, width_mm=4.0)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"ResonantFrequencyGHz": 2.886, "S11_resonant_dB": -15.799364160135527, "BandwidthMHz": 398.4, "MaxGaindBi": 2.1053086401722347}, "score": 60.0}
