{'completion_tokens': 500, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a strip dipole antenna for 3 GHz, I need to determine the appropriate length and width parameters.\n\n1. First, I'll calculate the wavelength at 3 GHz:\n   λ = c/f = 3×10^8 m/s / 3×10^9 Hz = 0.1 m = 100 mm\n\n2. For a resonant dipole antenna, the standard length is λ/2:\n   Length = λ/2 = 100 mm / 2 = 50 mm\n\n3. However, due to end effects and the finite width of the dipole, the actual physical length needs to be slightly shorter than λ/2, typically around 0.47λ to 0.48λ:\n   Length ≈ 0.475λ = 0.475 × 100 mm = 47.5 mm\n\n4. For the width, the constraint specifies that it should be at most 1/10 of the length:\n   Width ≤ Length/10 = 47.5 mm / 10 = 4.75 mm\n\n5. A reasonable width for good bandwidth would be around 2-5 mm. I'll select 4 mm as the width, which satisfies the constraint while providing sufficient conductor width for bandwidth requirements.\n\nThe selected dimensions (length = 47.5 mm, width = 4 mm) will:\n- Resonate close to 3 GHz (since the length is approximately half-wavelength)\n- Provide the required bandwidth of ≥100 MHz (the width-to-length ratio supports this)\n- Achieve the gain of ≥2 dBi (typical for dipole antennas in free space)\n- Stay well within the space constraint of 100 mm × 100 mm\n\nThese parameters represent a balanced design that should meet all the specified requirements.", config=ConfigFile(length_mm=47.5, width_mm=4.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.9172, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.802292948515378, 'BandwidthMHz': 403.2, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.105806424140213}, 'score': 66.87999999999991}
