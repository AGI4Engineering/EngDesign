{"completion_tokens": 337, "response": "reasoning=\"To design a strip dipole antenna for 3 GHz, we need to determine the length and width of the metallic patch. The length is approximately half the wavelength at the resonant frequency. The width is generally much smaller than the length, typically less than one-tenth of the length.\\n\\n1.  Calculate the wavelength: \u03bb = c / f, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s) and f is the frequency (3 GHz = 3 x 10^9 Hz).\\n    \u03bb = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (3 x 10^9 Hz) = 0.1 meters = 100 mm\\n2.  Determine the length: For a dipole, the length is approximately \u03bb/2.\\n    length_mm = 100 mm / 2 = 50 mm\\n3.  Determine the width: The width should be much smaller than the length. Let's choose a width that is 1/10 of the length.\\n    width_mm = 50 mm / 10 = 5 mm\\n4.  Check the Space Constraint: The antenna should fit within 100 mm x 100 mm. In this case, it fits.\\n5. Verify bandwidth and gain performance by simulation. Fine-tune the values if needed.\" config=ConfigFile(length_mm=50.0, width_mm=5.0)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"ResonantFrequencyGHz": 2.7348, "S11_resonant_dB": -15.477532141434242, "BandwidthMHz": 381.6, "MaxGaindBi": 2.0996028668838447}, "score": 60.0}
