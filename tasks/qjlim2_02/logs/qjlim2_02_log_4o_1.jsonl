{'completion_tokens': 286, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design a strip dipole antenna that resonates at 3 GHz, we need to calculate the length of the dipole. The resonant length of a dipole antenna is typically around half the wavelength (位/2) of the frequency it is designed to operate at. The wavelength (位) can be calculated using the speed of light (c = 3 x 10^8 m/s) and the frequency (f = 3 GHz).\n\n位 = c / f = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (3 x 10^9 Hz) = 0.1 m = 100 mm\n\nThe length of the dipole (l) should be approximately 位/2, which is 50 mm. However, to ensure the antenna fits within the space constraint and to account for practical design considerations, we can slightly adjust this length.\n\nThe width of the dipole should be at most 1/10 of the length, so we can choose a width of 5 mm.\n\nThese dimensions should allow the antenna to meet the resonant frequency, bandwidth, and gain requirements while fitting within the 100 mm x 100 mm space constraint.\n\nConfidence in this design is high due to the straightforward calculation and alignment with typical design practices for strip dipole antennas.', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=50.0, width_mm=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.7348, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.47739884648448, 'BandwidthMHz': 381.6, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.0996047198610275}, 'score': 60.0}
