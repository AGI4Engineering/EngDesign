For strip dipoles, we can use the following formula to more accurately determine the length:\nL = 0.48λ × [1 - 0.011 × ln(w/L)]\n\nThis is an implicit equation that requires iteration to solve. Starting with an estimated length of 48 mm and width of 4.5 mm:\nL = 0.48 × 100 mm × [1 - 0.011 × ln(4.5/48)]\nL = 48 mm × [1 - 0.011 × (-2.37)]\nL = 48 mm × [1 + 0.026]\nL = 49.25 mm\n\nRefining our calculation with this new value:\nL ≈ 49.3 mm\n\nStep 4: Check the width constraint.\nThe problem specifies that width should be at most 1/10 of the length.\nMaximum allowable width = 49.3 mm / 10 = 4.93 mm\nI'll choose width = 4.5 mm, which is below this limit.\n\nStep 5: Verify bandwidth requirement.\nFor a strip dipole at 3 GHz with these dimensions, the expected bandwidth should exceed 100 MHz. The fractional bandwidth of a half-wavelength dipole is typically 5-10% of the center frequency, which corresponds to 150-300 MHz at 3 GHz.\n\nStep 6: Verify gain requirement.\nA half-wavelength dipole in free space has a typical gain of about 2.15 dBi, which satisfies our requirement of ≥ 2 dBi.\n\nStep 7: Verify size constraint.\nOur dimensions (49.3 mm × 4.5 mm) are well within the space constraint of 100 mm × 100 mm.\n\nTherefore, a strip dipole with length 49.5 mm and width 4.5 mm will meet all the specified requirements.", config=ConfigFile(length_mm=49.5, width_mm=4.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 2.7948, 'S11_resonant_dB': -15.802289843950449, 'BandwidthMHz': 397.2, 'MaxGaindBi': 2.106494457949972}, 'score': 60.0}
