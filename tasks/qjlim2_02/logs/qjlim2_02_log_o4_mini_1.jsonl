A half‐wave (λ/2) dipole is the basic resonator, which consists of two quarter‐wave arms. Each arm length l = λ/4 ≈ 100 mm/4 = 25 mm.\n\n3. To allow for end effects and slight capacitive loading, we keep the physical length of each arm very close to 25 mm (typically trimming by a millimeter or two during tuning), so l ≈ 25 mm meets the resonant requirement.\n\n4. Bandwidth considerations: using a strip (rather than a thin wire) increases bandwidth. The rule of thumb is that the strip width w should not exceed 1/10 of the arm length for predictable radiation characteristics.  \n   • Maximum w ≈ l/10 = 25 mm/10 = 2.5 mm.\n\n5. We select w = 2.5 mm so that we stay within the width guideline. A 2.5 mm strip at 3 GHz will provide a bandwidth on the order of several percent (≥100 MHz) and a gain of roughly 2–2.5 dBi.\n\n6. The total dipole span from tip to tip is 2×l = 50 mm, which is well within the 100 mm × 100 mm footprint constraint.\n\nFinal chosen geometry:\n- length_mm (one arm) = 25 mm\n- width_mm = 2.5 mm\n\nThis design should resonate at 3 GHz with S11 ≤ –10 dB over a ≥100 MHz bandwidth and provide ≥2 dBi gain, all within the 100 mm × 100 mm space.', config=ConfigFile(length_mm=25.0, width_mm=2.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 3.6, 'S11_resonant_dB': -0.4974052473589144, 'BandwidthMHz': 0.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 1.8798417882964995}, 'score': 0.0}
