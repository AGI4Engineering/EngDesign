## Background

Strip dipole antennas are simple, efficient, and widely used in wireless communication systems for their broad bandwidth and omnidirectional radiation characteristics in the azimuth plane.

In this task, you are to design a strip dipole antenna that meets the specified performance objectives and constraints outlined below.

The dipole is centered at the origin and aligned along the x-axis, with its arms extending symmetrically in the ±x directions. The feed point lies at the center of the dipole, located in the x-y plane. The antenna is made of highly conductive material such as copper and is radiating in free space.

## Task Objective and Constraints

Your task is to design a Strip dipole antenna that meets the following specifications:

- Resonant Frequency: 3 GHz (S11 <= –10 dB)
- Bandwidth: >= 100 MHz
- Gain: >= 2 dBi
- Space Constraint [ Length × Width ]: <= 100 mm × 100 mm

## Design Inputs

Determine the optimal design parameters to satisfy the task objectives:

- Length of Metallic Patch in mm: length_mm
- Width of Metallic Patch in mm: width_mm
- Confidence of your design: confidence

## Additional Note

The width of the antenna should generally be at most 1/10 of the length of the antenna.
