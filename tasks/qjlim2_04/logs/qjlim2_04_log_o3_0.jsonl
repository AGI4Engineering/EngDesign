A monopole mounted on a large ground plane resonates when its physical height is about one-quarter wavelength, but due to end effects the electrical length is very slightly longer than the physical rod. Using the empirical factor 0.97–0.98, the required physical height is close to λ/4 = 616 mm / 4 ≈ 154 mm.\n3. Bandwidth and match: A moderate rod radius gives a wider impedance bandwidth. The guideline radius ≤ length/20 → ≤ 154 mm / 20 ≈ 7.7 mm. A radius of 5 mm (10 mm diameter) is a good trade-off: • still slender (≈ L/30) • practical for fabrication • typically yields >10 MHz S11 < –10 dB bandwidth around the design frequency.\n4. Gain: A λ/4 monopole over a perfectly conducting ground plane delivers ~5.1 dBi peak (2.1 dBi average over all azimuths). Thus the ≥ 0 dBi requirement is comfortably met.\n5. Therefore choose\n   • Height ≈ 154 mm.\n   • Radius ≈ 5 mm.\nThese values should place the first resonance very close to 0.487 GHz, supply at least a 10 MHz –10 dB bandwidth and exceed 0 dBi gain.\nConfidence: moderate; small tweaks (±3 mm height) may be required in a full-wave solver to hit |S11| ≤ –10 dB exactly at 0.487 GHz.', config=ConfigFile(height_mm=154.0, radius_mm=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 0.47559999999999997, 'S11_resonant_dB': -10.272890133346904, 'BandwidthMHz': 20.4, 'MaxGaindBi': 1.224681144370968}, 'score': 60.0}
