Calculate the wavelength (\u03bb) for the resonant frequency (f = 0.487 GHz):\\n   \u03bb = c / f, where c is the speed of light (approx. 2.99792458 x 10^8 m/s).\\n   \u03bb = (2.99792458 * 10^8 m/s) / (0.487 * 10^9 Hz) \u2248 0.61559 m = 615.59 mm.\\n\\n2. Determine the initial estimate for the monopole height (h):\\n   A monopole antenna is typically resonant when its height is slightly less than a quarter-wavelength (\u03bb/4) due to end effects and its finite radius.\\n   Nominal h_quarter_wave = \u03bb / 4 = 615.59 mm / 4 \u2248 153.8975 mm.\\n\\n3. Apply a shortening factor to estimate the physical height for resonance:\\n   For cylindrical monopoles, the resonant length is shorter than \u03bb/4. The shortening factor depends on the height-to-radius ratio (h/a). A common factor for moderately thick monopoles (e.g., h/a around 20-30) is about 0.95.\\n   height_mm = 0.95 * 153.8975 mm \u2248 146.202625 mm. We round this to 146.2 mm.\\n\\n4. Determine the radius (radius_mm) based on the constraint and bandwidth considerations:\\n   The constraint is radius_mm \u2264 height_mm / 20.\\n   radius_mm \u2264 146.2 mm / 20 = 7.31 mm.\\n   A larger radius (resulting in a smaller h/a ratio) generally provides wider bandwidth. We choose a radius close to the maximum allowed by the constraint to help achieve good bandwidth, ensuring the h/a ratio is consistent with the assumed shortening factor.\\n   Let radius_mm = 7.0 mm.\\n   This choice (7.0 mm) satisfies the constraint (\u2264 7.31 mm).\\n   The height-to-radius ratio is h/a = 146.2 mm / 7.0 mm \u2248 20.89. This ratio is characteristic of a 'moderately thick' monopole, for which a shortening factor around 0.95 is appropriate and good bandwidth is expected.\\n\\n5. Verify performance objectives with the chosen parameters:\\n   a. Resonant Frequency (S11 \u2264 \u201310 dB at 0.487 GHz):\\n      With h \u2248 0.95 * (\u03bb/4) and h/a \u2248 20.89, the antenna should be resonant near 0.487 GHz.\\n      The input impedance (Z_in = R_in + jX_in) at resonance will have X_in \u2248 0 \u03a9. The input resistance R_in for such a monopole is typically in the range of 35-40 \u03a9.\\n      Assuming R_in = 38 \u03a9 and the feed system impedance Z_0 = 70 \u03a9:\\n      Reflection coefficient \u0393 = (Z_in - Z_0) / (Z_in + Z_0) = (38 - 70) / (38 + 70) = -32 / 108 \u2248 -0.2963.\\n      Return Loss S11 (dB) = 20 * log10(|\u0393|) = 20 * log10(0.2963) \u2248 -10.56 dB.\\n      This meets the S11 \u2264 \u201310 dB requirement.\\n\\n   b. Bandwidth: \u2265 10 MHz\\n      Monopoles with h/a ratios around 20-30 typically have a -10dB return loss bandwidth of 10-15% of the center frequency.\\n      Estimated bandwidth = 0.10 * 487 MHz = 48.7 MHz.\\n      This is significantly greater than the required \u2265 10 MHz.\\n\\n   c. Gain: \u2265 0 dBi\\n      A quarter-wave monopole over a large, perfectly conducting ground plane (300m x 300m is very large compared to \u03bb \u2248 0.616m) has a theoretical maximum gain of about 5.16 dBi. The actual gain in the upper hemisphere is expected to be well above 0 dBi.\\n\\n6.
