{'completion_tokens': 1651, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Resonant frequency target is 0.487 GHz. A monopole over an infinite ground plane resonates at approximately a quarter wavelength: λ0≈c/f≈(3·10^8 m/s)/(0.487·10^9 Hz)≈0.616 m, so a quarter-wave is L≈0.616/4≈0.154 m (154 mm).\n\n2. In practice, finite radius and end-effect slightly increase the electrical length, but starting with 154 mm gives us a close physical length; fine tuning can be done in a full-wave simulator.\n\n3. Bandwidth increases with a thicker cylinder (larger radius), but the radius should remain ≤1/20 of the height (r/h≤0.05) to avoid excessive structural size. With h=154 mm, the maximum r≈154/20≈7.7 mm.\n\n4. To ensure at least a 10 MHz bandwidth (≈2% fractional) we choose a moderate thickness ratio r/h≈0.04, which typically delivers a fractional bandwidth of a few percent for monopoles. That implies r≈0.04·154 mm≈6.2 mm.\n\n5. Rounding to practical machining sizes, we set:\n   • Height h=154 mm\n   • Radius r=6 mm\n\nThis design should resonate at ~0.487 GHz with S11≤–10 dB, bandwidth ≥10 MHz, and gain ≥0 dBi when mounted above a large conducting ground plane.', config=ConfigFile(height_mm=154.0, radius_mm=6.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 0.48279999999999995, 'S11_resonant_dB': -10.750927893437371, 'BandwidthMHz': 34.2, 'MaxGaindBi': 1.204116866134944}, 'score': 83.19999999999985}
