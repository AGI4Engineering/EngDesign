However, in practice, this value needs to be adjusted based on the radius of the antenna and other factors affecting its effective electrical length.\n\nTheoretical height = λ/4 = 616 mm / 4 = 154 mm\n\nIn practice, the height is often slightly less than λ/4 due to capacitive end effects, typically between 0.22λ to 0.24λ. I'll use 0.23λ as a practical value.\n\nPractical height = 0.23 × 616 mm = 141.68 mm ≈ 142 mm\n\n**Step 3: Determine the radius of the monopole**\nAs mentioned in the additional note, the radius should be at most 1/20 of the length of the antenna.\n\nMaximum radius = height / 20 = 142 mm / 20 = 7.1 mm\n\nFor good bandwidth, the radius should be reasonably large but within this constraint. A thicker monopole provides better bandwidth but may affect the impedance matching.\n\nA radius of about 5-6 mm would be appropriate for this design, providing a good balance between bandwidth and impedance matching. I'll choose 5 mm as the radius.\n\n**Step 4: Verification**\n- Height = 142 mm (approximately 0.23λ)\n- Radius = 5 mm (approximately 1/28 of the height, well within the 1/20 constraint)\n- This design should resonate at 0.487 GHz with a bandwidth ≥ 10 MHz\n- The gain should be ≥ 0 dBi as required (a typical monopole over a perfect ground plane has a theoretical gain of about 5.15 dBi)\n- The impedance at the feed point should be close to 70 ohms as specified for the lumped port", config=ConfigFile(height_mm=142.0, radius_mm=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 0.5134, 'S11_resonant_dB': -10.631779117899152, 'BandwidthMHz': 32.4, 'MaxGaindBi': 1.0739482278748862}, 'score': 60.0}
