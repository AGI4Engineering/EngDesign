{'completion_tokens': 1758, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A good starting point for a cylindrical monopole design at 0.487\u202fGHz is to approximate its length at about one quarter of a free‐space wavelength. The free‐space wavelength at 0.487\u202fGHz is about 616\u202fmm, so the quarter‐wave length is roughly 154\u202fmm. Using a moderate cylinder radius can help broaden the bandwidth; however, it must stay less than 1/20 of the total length (which would be about 7.7\u202fmm for a 154\u202fmm monopole). A radius of around 4\u202fmm provides sufficient bandwidth margin above 10\u202fMHz while comfortably staying under that ratio. This geometry should exhibit better than −10\u202fdB reflection at the target frequency and achieve a gain at or above 0\u202fdBi on a 300\u202fm × 300\u202fm ground plane. Therefore, the following design parameters should resonate close to 0.487\u202fGHz with adequate bandwidth and gain.', config=ConfigFile(height_mm=154.0, radius_mm=4.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 0.47559999999999997, 'S11_resonant_dB': -9.868479997249322, 'BandwidthMHz': 0.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 1.223600774933116}, 'score': 20.0}
