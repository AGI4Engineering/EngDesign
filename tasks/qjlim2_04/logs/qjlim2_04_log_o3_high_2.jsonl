The free-space wavelength is λ = c / f ≈ 3·10^8 m s⁻¹ / 4.87·10^8 Hz ≈ 0.616 m (616 mm).\n2. A monopole over an infinite ground plane resonates close to an electrical length of λ/4.  λ/4 ≈ 0.616 m / 4 ≈ 0.154 m (154 mm).\n3. Practical designs shorten the physical length slightly (≈ 0.95 · λ/4) to compensate for end-effects and obtain good matching with a 70 Ω feed. 0.95 · 154 mm ≈ 146 mm. Choosing a convenient round value gives 150 mm, which remains within the λ/4 window and provides some tuning margin.\n4. To ensure > 10 MHz bandwidth and keep S11 low, moderate conductor thickness is helpful. The guideline is radius ≤ (1/20)·height, so with height ≈ 150 mm the radius must be ≤ 7.5 mm. A radius of 6 mm (12 mm diameter) gives a height-to-radius ratio of 25, which both satisfies the guideline and broadens bandwidth modestly.\n5. A 150 mm × 6 mm cylindrical monopole on a 300 m × 300 m PEC ground plane typically provides ~2 dBi peak gain and > 10 MHz impedance bandwidth around 0.487 GHz, meeting the requirements.\n6. Confidence in this first-order design (before fine EM optimisation) is moderate; small tweaks (±5 mm in height or ±1 mm in radius) can be applied during simulation for exact S11 centring.', config=ConfigFile(height_mm=150.0, radius_mm=6.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 0.4905999999999999, 'S11_resonant_dB': -10.875990354640374, 'BandwidthMHz': 37.8, 'MaxGaindBi': 1.1684877819912407}, 'score': 85.60000000000025}
