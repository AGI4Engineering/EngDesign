{'completion_tokens': 1038, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To determine the monopole height for resonance at 0.487 GHz, we use the quarter-wavelength formula: λ = c / f ≈ (3×10^8 m/s) / (0.487×10^9 Hz) ≈ 0.616 m, so λ/4 ≈ 0.154 m (154 mm). This places the fundamental resonance right at 0.487 GHz, with an S11 of –10 dB or better.\n\nTo secure a bandwidth of at least 10 MHz and maintain a low Q, a larger cylinder radius is beneficial—up to the recommended maximum of 1/20 of the length. With a height of 154 mm, the maximum radius is 154/20 = 7.7 mm. Using this radius will broaden the bandwidth while preserving omnidirectional radiation and a gain ≥ 0 dBi.\n\nBased on these calculations:\n- height_mm = 154 mm (quarter-wavelength at 0.487 GHz)\n- radius_mm = 7.7 mm (maximum of length/20 to maximize bandwidth)\n\nI am reasonably confident (~80%) this design will meet S11 ≤ –10 dB at 0.487 GHz, achieve ≥ 10 MHz bandwidth, and deliver ≥ 0 dBi gain over the required frequency band.', config=ConfigFile(height_mm=154.0, radius_mm=7.7)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 0.48339999999999994, 'S11_resonant_dB': -11.651639104935002, 'BandwidthMHz': 52.8, 'MaxGaindBi': 1.2033999215302675}, 'score': 85.59999999999981}
