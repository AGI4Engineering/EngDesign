For a monopole antenna, the theoretical quarter-wavelength is 154 mm, but due to end effects, the actual resonant length needs to be adjusted. Using the formula L ≈ (0.24 - 0.025 × a/L) × λ and iteratively solving with a radius-to-height ratio of approximately 0.03 (which provides sufficient bandwidth), I determined the optimal height to be 147 mm. The radius of 4.4 mm ensures a good balance between bandwidth and impedance matching, while staying well below the maximum radius constraint of height/20 (which would be 7.35 mm). This configuration will provide the required gain (≥ 0 dBi) and bandwidth (≥ 10 MHz) while resonating at 0.487 GHz.', config=ConfigFile(height_mm=147.0, radius_mm=4.4)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 0.49839999999999995, 'S11_resonant_dB': -10.208025752871087, 'BandwidthMHz': 18.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 1.1352905548931873}, 'score': 60.0}
