{'completion_tokens': 950, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Calculate the free-space wavelength at 0.487 GHz:\n   λ = c / f = (3×10^8 m/s) / (0.487×10^9 Hz) ≈ 0.615 m = 615 mm.\n\n2. Monopole resonance over a large ground plane occurs near λ/4:\n   L_res ≈ λ/4 ≈ 615 mm / 4 = 153.75 mm.\n\n3. Account for end effects and practical tuning (tendency is to shorten the physical length slightly). We select a height of approximately 154 mm to target resonance at 0.487 GHz.\n\n4. Bandwidth consideration: a thicker monopole (larger radius) increases the fractional bandwidth. A 10 MHz bandwidth requirement at 0.487 GHz corresponds to approximately 2 % fractional bandwidth. To achieve that without exceeding mechanical constraints, we choose a radius close to the maximum recommended (height/20):\n   Max radius ≈ 154 mm / 20 = 7.7 mm.\n\n5. We pick a radius of 7 mm (≈1.1 % of the wavelength) which is under the 1/20 ratio and should yield at least 2 % bandwidth (≈10 MHz) with S11 ≤ –10 dB.\n\n6.
