{"completion_tokens": 321, "response": "reasoning='To design a cylindrical monopole antenna resonating at 0.487 GHz, we need to determine its optimal height and radius. The height is approximately a quarter-wavelength at the resonant frequency. The radius is chosen to be significantly smaller than the height. Given the resonant frequency of 0.487 GHz, the wavelength in free space can be calculated as follows:\\n\\n\u03bb = c / f = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (0.487 x 10^9 Hz) \u2248 0.616 m\\n\\nThe height of the monopole antenna is approximately \u03bb/4:\\n\\nh = \u03bb/4 \u2248 0.616 m / 4 \u2248 0.154 m = 154 mm\\n\\nThe radius is usually much smaller than the height, a common ratio is height/radius equals to 20. so the radius can be calculated as:\\n\\nr = h / 20 = 154 mm / 20 = 7.7 mm\\n\\nSo the approximate height and radius are 154 mm and 7.7 mm. Also the gain of monopole should be over 0 dBi and bandwidth should be equal or larger than 10 MHz.' config=ConfigFile(height_mm=154.0, radius_mm=7.7)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"ResonantFrequencyGHz": 0.48339999999999994, "S11_resonant_dB": -11.651639104935002, "BandwidthMHz": 52.8, "MaxGaindBi": 1.2033999215302675}, "score": 85.59999999999981}
