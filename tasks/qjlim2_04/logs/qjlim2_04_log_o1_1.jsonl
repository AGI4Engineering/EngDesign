{'completion_tokens': 2510, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A good starting point is to treat the antenna as a quarter‐wave monopole, since 0.487\u202fGHz corresponds to a wavelength of about 616\xa0mm in free space. A quarter‐wave section is about 154\xa0mm in height. Making the cylinder moderately thick (5\xa0mm radius) both enhances bandwidth and still satisfies the requirement that the radius be no more than 1/20 of the height. This design should reliably achieve at least 10\xa0MHz bandwidth around 0.487\xa0GHz and a gain ≥\xa00\xa0dBi on a large ground plane, given typical quarter‐wave monopole performance.', config=ConfigFile(height_mm=154.0, radius_mm=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 0.47559999999999997, 'S11_resonant_dB': -10.272890133346904, 'BandwidthMHz': 20.4, 'MaxGaindBi': 1.224681144370968}, 'score': 60.0}
