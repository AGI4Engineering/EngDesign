First, I'll calculate the wavelength at the resonant frequency:\n   λ = c/f = 3×10⁸ m/s ÷ 0.487×10⁹ Hz = 0.616 meters = 616 mm\n\n2. For the height of the monopole:\n   - A standard quarter-wavelength monopole would be λ/4 = 616 mm/4 = 154 mm\n   - However, due to end effects, the actual resonant length is typically shorter\n   - A common approximation is 0.24λ instead of 0.25λ\n   - Therefore: height = 0.24 × 616 mm = 147.84 mm ≈ 148 mm\n\n3. For the radius selection:\n   - Must satisfy the constraint: radius ≤ height/20\n   - Maximum allowable radius = 148 mm/20 = 7.4 mm\n   - Choosing a radius of 5 mm provides good bandwidth while remaining within constraints\n\n4. Bandwidth verification:\n   - For a monopole, bandwidth can be estimated using the quality factor Q\n   - Q ≈ 1/(2×(radius/height)) = 1/(2×(5/148)) ≈ 14.8\n   - Bandwidth ≈ f₀/Q = 0.487 GHz/14.8 ≈ 33 MHz\n   - This exceeds the required 10 MHz bandwidth\n\n5. Gain verification:\n   - A standard monopole over a large ground plane has approximately 5.15 dBi gain\n   - This exceeds the required 0 dBi minimum", config=ConfigFile(height_mm=148.0, radius_mm=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 0.49839999999999995, 'S11_resonant_dB': -10.442856541569475, 'BandwidthMHz': 26.4, 'MaxGaindBi': 1.1377224034182467}, 'score': 60.0}
