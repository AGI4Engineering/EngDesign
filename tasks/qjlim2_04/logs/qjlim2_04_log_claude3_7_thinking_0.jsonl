Using the formula:\nh = (λ/4) × [1 - 0.2 × (a/h)]\n\nI'll solve this iteratively for a radius of 5 mm:\n- Initial h = 154 mm\n- First iteration: h = 154 × [1 - 0.2 × (5/154)] = 154 × 0.9935 ≈ 153 mm\n- Second iteration: h = 154 × [1 - 0.2 × (5/153)] = 154 × 0.99346 ≈ 153 mm\n\nStep 4: Check the radius constraint.\nOur constraint is that radius must be at most 1/20 of the height.\nMaximum allowed radius = 153/20 = 7.65 mm\nOur chosen radius of 5 mm gives a ratio of 5/153 = 0.0327, which is well below the 1/20 limit.\n\nStep 5: Verify the bandwidth.\nFor a monopole antenna, the approximate fractional bandwidth is:\nFractional BW ≈ 1.5 × (a/h) = 1.5 × (5/153) ≈ 0.049 or 4.9%\nThis translates to a bandwidth of 0.049 × 487 MHz ≈ 24 MHz, which exceeds our 10 MHz requirement.\n\nStep 6: Confirm the gain.\nA standard quarter-wave monopole over a large ground plane typically has a gain of approximately 5.15 dBi, which easily exceeds our requirement of ≥ 0 dBi.\n\nThe final dimensions of 153 mm height and 5 mm radius should provide a resonant frequency of 0.487 GHz with a bandwidth exceeding 10 MHz and gain well above 0 dBi.", config=ConfigFile(height_mm=153.0, radius_mm=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 0.48339999999999994, 'S11_resonant_dB': -10.317561350860275, 'BandwidthMHz': 21.6, 'MaxGaindBi': 1.1990174215223584}, 'score': 85.59999999999981}
