For a monopole above a perfect ground, the fundamental resonance occurs at ≈ λ/4, but due to end-capacitance the practical optimum is 0.23–0.24 λ.  \n   • Choose height = 0.24 λ ≈ 0.24 × 616.8 mm ≈ 148 mm.\n3. Radius guideline: ≤ height/20.  \n   • height/20 ≈ 7.4 mm.  \n   • Selecting 6 mm keeps the structure mechanically robust while offering slightly wider bandwidth than a thinner wire.\n4. Performance considerations:  \n   • A 148 mm × 6 mm monopole over a 300 m ground plane gives expected |S11| ≤ –10 dB near 0.487 GHz with ≥ 10 MHz matching bandwidth (typical for this diameter).  \n   • Radiation pattern is that of an ideal monopole, yielding ≈ 5 dBi peak gain (requirement ≥ 0 dBi satisfied).  \n5. The chosen dimensions also conform to fabrication practicality and the stated radius-to-length constraint.\n\nHence the design parameters that best meet the given specifications are height ≈ 148 mm and radius ≈ 6 mm.', config=ConfigFile(height_mm=148.0, radius_mm=6.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 0.49839999999999995, 'S11_resonant_dB': -10.951046191296324, 'BandwidthMHz': 39.6, 'MaxGaindBi': 1.1387708285579496}, 'score': 60.0}
