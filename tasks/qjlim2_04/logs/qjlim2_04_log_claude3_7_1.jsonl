Let's approach this systematically.\n\n1. First, I'll calculate the monopole height based on the resonant frequency.\nFor a typical quarter-wave monopole antenna, the height is approximately λ/4, where λ is the wavelength.\n\nThe wavelength λ = c/f, where c is the speed of light (3×10^8 m/s) and f is the frequency.\n\nλ = 3×10^8 / (0.487×10^9) = 0.616 meters = 616 mm\n\nTherefore, for a quarter-wave monopole: height ≈ λ/4 = 616/4 = 154 mm\n\n2. For the radius, I need to consider the constraint that it should be at most 1/20 of the length.\nMaximum radius = height/20 = 154/20 = 7.7 mm\n\nHowever, the actual optimal radius depends on several factors including the desired impedance and bandwidth.\n\n3. For cylindrical monopoles, a thicker radius generally provides better bandwidth, but if too thick, it can affect the resonant frequency.\n\nConsidering the bandwidth requirement of ≥10 MHz and the gain requirement of ≥0 dBi (which is typically met by monopoles over a large ground plane), I'll choose a radius that is substantial enough for good bandwidth but within our constraint.\n\nA common approach is to use a radius that is approximately 1/50 to 1/30 of the height for good performance.\n\nRadius ≈ height/40 = 154/40 = 3.85 mm\n\nRounding for practical implementation: I'll use a radius of 4 mm.\n\nTherefore, my design parameters are:\nHeight = 154 mm\nRadius = 4 mm", config=ConfigFile(height_mm=154.0, radius_mm=4.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ResonantFrequencyGHz': 0.47559999999999997, 'S11_resonant_dB': -9.868479997249322, 'BandwidthMHz': 0.0, 'MaxGaindBi': 1.223600774933116}, 'score': 20.0}
