## parameters of designed strip dipole antenna
height = 150           # Length in mm
radius = 5              # Width in mm

# Performance
f_resonant = 0.487      # Resonant frequency in GHz (with S11 below -10 dB)
s11_dB = -10.40         # Return loss (dB)
bandwidth_MHz = 25.20      # Bandwidth in MHz
max_gain_dBi = 1.18     # Maximum gain in dBi
