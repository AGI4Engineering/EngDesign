Cylindrical monopole antennas are vertically oriented antennas commonly used for broadband and omnidirectional communication in the azimuth plane. They are typically placed over a large ground plane and function as a half-wave dipole with one arm mirrored by the ground.

In this task, you are to design a cylindrical monopole antenna that meets the specified performance objectives and constraints outlined below.

The monopole is centered at the origin and aligned along the z-axis, extending vertically from the ground plane. The antenna is made of a highly conductive material such as copper and radiates in free space. It is mounted on a perfectly conducting square ground plane of size 300 m × 300 m and is fed using a 70-ohm lumped port at its base.

reasoning='To design a cylindrical monopole antenna for the given specifications, we first need to calculate the physical dimensions that correspond to a resonant frequency of 0.487 GHz. For a monopole antenna, the effective length is typically a quarter wavelength (λ/4). \n\n1. **Calculate the Wavelength (λ):**\n   - Speed of light, c = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n   - Frequency, f = 0.487 GHz = 0.487 x 10^9 Hz\n   - Wavelength, λ = c / f = 3 x 10^8 / 0.487 x 10^9 = 0.616 m\n\n2. **Calculate the Height (h):**\n   - Monopole height should be approximately λ/4\n   - h = 0.616 / 4 = 0.154 m = 154 mm\n\n3. **Determine the Radius:**\n   - The radius should be at most 1/20 of the height\n   - r ≤ 154 / 20 = 7.7 mm\n   - To ensure simplicity and manufacturability, choose a radius of 7.5 mm\n\n4. **Check Bandwidth and Gain:**\n   - A well-designed monopole with these dimensions and using a highly conductive material like copper on a sufficient ground plane should inherently satisfy the bandwidth and gain conditions. The specified ground plane (300 m x 300 m) is more than sufficient for ground plane considerations.\n\n5. **Design Confidence:**\n   - The simplicity of the monopole structure and the comprehensive ground plane reduces complexity and uncertainties. This brings high confidence that the design will meet all specifications. \n\nHence, the final design parameters are:\n- Height = 154 mm\n- Radius = 7.5 mm\n- Confidence: High' config=ConfigFile(height_mm=154.0, radius_mm=7.5)
