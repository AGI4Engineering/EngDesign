Background
----------

Cylindrical monopole antennas are vertically oriented antennas commonly used for broadband and omnidirectional communication in the azimuth plane. They are typically placed over a large ground plane and function as a half-wave dipole with one arm mirrored by the ground.

In this task, you are to design a cylindrical monopole antenna that meets the specified performance objectives and constraints outlined below.

The monopole is centered at the origin and aligned along the z-axis, extending vertically from the ground plane. The antenna is made of a highly conductive material such as copper and radiates in free space. It is mounted on a perfectly conducting square ground plane of size 300 m × 300 m and is fed using a 70-ohm lumped port at its base.

Task Objective and Constraints
------------------------------

Your task is to design a cylindrical monopole antenna that meets the following specifications:

Resonant Frequency: 0.487 GHz (S11 ≤ –10 dB)

Bandwidth: ≥ 10 MHz

Gain: ≥ 0 dBi

-------------
Design Inputs
-------------

Determine the optimal design parameters to satisfy the task objectives:

Height of cylindrical monopole in mm: height_mm

Radius of cylindrical monopole in mm: radius_mm

Confidence of your design: confidence

Additional Note
----------------

The radius of the antenna should generally be at most 1/20 of the length of the antenna.
