## Task Description
In this task, you are required to design a digital IIR filter, used to eliminate a particular resonant frequency that is affecting a sensor reading.

### Design Constraints
The sensor signal is being sampled at a rate of 2000Hz.
The resonant frequency you should eliminate is 120Hz.
Your filter should strongly attenuate the resonant frequency. (Attenuation more than 40dB)
Your filter should minimally affect frequencies more than 5Hz below the resonant frequency. (Attenuation less than 3dB at 115Hz)
Your filter should minimally affect frequencies more than 5Hz above the resonant frequency. (Attenuation less than 3dB at 125Hz)

### Response Specifications
Provide the following information as your response.
- The filter order
- A list of the filter's numerator coefficients (Provide ALL of them)
- A list of the filter's denominator coefficients (Provide ALL of them)
