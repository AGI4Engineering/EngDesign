Let's use r = 0.98.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate filter coefficients\nWith ω₀ = 0.377 and r = 0.98:\n\nb₀ = 1\nb₁ = -2*cos(ω₀) = -2*cos(0.377) = -1.8626\nb₂ = 1\n\na₀ = 1\na₁ = -2*r*cos(ω₀) = -2*0.98*cos(0.377) = -1.8254\na₂ = r² = 0.98² = 0.9604\n\n### Step 5: Verify the filter response\nAt 120 Hz (our notch frequency), the attenuation will be significant.\nAt 115 Hz and 125 Hz, which are 5 Hz away from the notch, the attenuation should be less than 3 dB with our chosen r value.\n\nThe second-order notch filter should meet our requirements with these coefficients.\n\n### Step 6: Finalize the design\nThe final filter order is 2.\nThe numerator coefficients are [1, -1.8626, 1].\nThe denominator coefficients are [1, -1.8254, 0.9604].", config=ConfigFile(order=2.0, coeffs_numerator=[1.0, -1.8626, 1.0], coeffs_denominator=[1.0, -1.8254, 0.9604])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'order': 2.0, 'numerator coefficients': [1.0, -1.8626, 1.0], 'denominator coefficients': [1.0, -1.8254, 0.9604], 'passband below target attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'passband above target attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'target frequency attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'order value reasonable': True, 'order and coefficient are properly related': True}, 'score': 40}
