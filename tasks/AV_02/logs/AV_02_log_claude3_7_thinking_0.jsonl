A second-order IIR notch filter has the transfer function:\nH(z) = (1 - 2cos(ω₀)z⁻¹ + z⁻²) / (1 - 2rcos(ω₀)z⁻¹ + r²z⁻²)\n\nwhere:\n- The zeros are placed exactly at the notch frequency on the unit circle\n- The poles are placed at the same angle but at radius r < 1\n- r controls the width of the notch (closer to 1 = narrower notch)\n\nGiven our bandwidth requirement (10Hz on a 2000Hz sampling frequency = 0.01 normalized), I can set r = 0.995.\n\nLet's calculate the coefficients:\n- cos(0.12π) ≈ 0.8090\n- Numerator coefficients: [1, -2*0.8090, 1] = [1, -1.618, 1]\n- Denominator coefficients: [1, -2*0.995*0.8090, 0.995²] = [1, -1.61, 0.99]\n\nWith these coefficients:\n- At 120Hz: The attenuation will be approximately 20*log₁₀((1-r)/(1+r)) ≈ -52dB (exceeding our 40dB requirement)\n- At 115Hz and 125Hz: The attenuation will be less than 3dB\n\nThe order of this filter is 2, based on the highest power of z⁻¹ in the denominator.", config=ConfigFile(order=2.0, coeffs_numerator=[1.0, -1.618, 1.0], coeffs_denominator=[1.0, -1.61, 0.99])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'order': 2.0, 'numerator coefficients': [1.0, -1.618, 1.0], 'denominator coefficients': [1.0, -1.61, 0.99], 'passband below target attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'passband above target attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'target frequency attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'order value reasonable': True, 'order and coefficient are properly related': True}, 'score': 40}
