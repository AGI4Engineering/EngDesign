{'completion_tokens': 10537, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Below is a standard second-order (biquad) notch filter design that will strongly attenuate 120 Hz while being only -3 dB down at 115 Hz and 125 Hz. The filter places a pair of zeros exactly on the unit circle at 120 Hz (giving infinite rejection there) and a corresponding pair of poles slightly inside the unit circle to set the notch bandwidth.\n\nTo locate the notch at 120 Hz with a 2000 Hz sample rate, we use:\n  ω₀ = 2π × (120/2000) ≈ 0.377 rad/sample.\n\nA suitable pole radius r was found by requiring about -3 dB at 115 and 125 Hz, which leads to r ≈ 0.9805. Consequently, the filter transfer function is:\n\n  H(z) = [1 - 2 cos(ω₀) z⁻¹ + z⁻²] / [1 - 2r cos(ω₀) z⁻¹ + r² z⁻²].\n\nUsing cos(ω₀) ≈ 0.9287 and r = 0.9805 yields the following coefficients.\n', config=ConfigFile(order=2.0, coeffs_numerator=[1.0, -1.8574, 1.0], coeffs_denominator=[1.0, -1.8207, 0.9614])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'order': 2.0, 'numerator coefficients': [1.0, -1.8574, 1.0], 'denominator coefficients': [1.0, -1.8207, 0.9614], 'passband below target attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'passband above target attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'target frequency attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'order value reasonable': True, 'order and coefficient are properly related': True}, 'score': 20}
