{'completion_tokens': 651, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design an IIR filter that meets the specified requirements, a second-order notch filter is suitable. A notch filter is designed to attenuate a narrow band of frequencies around the resonant frequency (120 Hz in this case) while minimally affecting other frequencies. Given the sampling rate of 2000 Hz and the target attenuation of more than 40 dB at 120 Hz, and less than 3dB at 115Hz and 125Hz, the filter coefficients can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Notch Frequency:** (f_0 = 120 Hz)\n2. **Sampling Frequency:** (f_s = 2000 Hz)\n3. **Normalized Notch Frequency:** (w_0 = 2*pi * (f_0/f_s) = 2*pi * (120/2000) = 0.377)\n\n4. **Bandwidth Parameter:** The bandwidth parameter (r) controls the width of the notch. A smaller r results in a narrower notch. A starting point will be chosen and then the design will be iterated to meet the required frequency response. (r = 0.99)\n\n5. **Filter Coefficients:**\n   - Numerator Coefficients: (b_0 = 1), (b_1 = -2*cos(w_0)), (b_2 = 1)\n   - Denominator Coefficients: (a_0 = 1), (a_1 = -2r*cos(w_0)), (a_2 = r^2)\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n(b_0 = 1)\n(b_1 = -2*cos(0.377) = -2 * 0.9304 = -1.8608)\n(b_2 = 1)\n\n(a_0 = 1)\n(a_1 = -2 * 0.99 * cos(0.377) = -2 * 0.99 * 0.9304 = -1.8420)\n(a_2 = 0.99^2 = 0.9801)\n\nThus, the coefficients are:\nNumerator: [1, -1.8608, 1]\nDenominator: [1, -1.8420, 0.9801]\n\nThe filter order is 2, since it is a second-order notch filter.', config=ConfigFile(order=2.0, coeffs_numerator=[1.0, -1.8608, 1.0], coeffs_denominator=[1.0, -1.842, 0.9801])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'order': 2.0, 'numerator coefficients': [1.0, -1.8608, 1.0], 'denominator coefficients': [1.0, -1.842, 0.9801], 'passband below target attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'passband above target attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'target frequency attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'order value reasonable': True, 'order and coefficient are properly related': True}, 'score': 60}
