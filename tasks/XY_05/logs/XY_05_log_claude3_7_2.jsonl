Let me work through each component:\n\nPART 1: Control Signal Settings\nFor each instruction, I need to determine the correct configuration of control signals during execution:\n\n1. ADD: This is an arithmetic operation that needs the ALU to compute the result (gateALU=1), load the result into a register (ld_reg=1), and update condition codes (ld_cc=1). No memory operations or PC updates occur.\n\n2. AND: Similar to ADD, this is a logical operation using the ALU (gateALU=1), requiring register updates (ld_reg=1) and condition code changes (ld_cc=1).\n\n3. NOT: A bitwise complement operation that uses the ALU (gateALU=1), updates a register (ld_reg=1), and sets condition codes (ld_cc=1).\n\n4. BR: A conditional branch that only updates the PC (ld_pc=1) if the condition is met. No register or CC updates needed.\n\n5. JMP: Unconditionally updates the PC (ld_pc=1) without other register or memory operations.\n\n6. JSR: Requires saving the return address to R7 (ld_reg=1) before jumping to the subroutine address (ld_pc=1).\n\n7. LDR: A memory read operation requiring memory enable (mem_en=1), loading from MDR to a register (gateMDR=1, ld_reg=1), and updating condition codes (ld_cc=1).\n\n8. STR: A memory write operation that enables memory (mem_en=1) and sets write enable (mem_we=1) without register updates.\n\n9. SWAP: A custom operation that uses the ALU to exchange register values (gateALU=1, ld_reg=1) and updates condition codes (ld_cc=1).\n\nPART 2: State Machine Implementation\nFor each instruction, I mapped the state transitions based on the provided state machine:\n\n1. ADD: Single-cycle operation from state s_1 returning to fetch (s_18)\n2. AND: Single-cycle from s_5 to s_18\n3. NOT: Single-cycle from s_9 to s_18\n4. BR: Conditional path from s_0, either to s_22 (if taken) or directly to s_18 (if not taken)\n5. JMP: Single-cycle from s_12 to s_18\n6. JSR: Multi-cycle sequence from s_4 through s_21 (to store the return address) and back to s_18\n7. LDR: Multi-cycle memory read sequence from s_6 through the memory access states (s_25_1, s_25_2, s_25_3), data ready state (s_27), and back to s_18\n8. STR: Multi-cycle memory write sequence from s_7 through address calculation (s_23) and memory write states (s_16_1, s_16_2, s_16_3) to s_18\n9. SWAP: I've treated this custom instruction as similar to ADD in implementation, so it goes from s_1 to s_18\n\nPART 3: Explanations\nI've provided detailed explanations for each instruction, covering the purpose of the instruction, how the control signals achieve that purpose, and the state transitions involved.\n\nAll of this follows the hardware constraints: no multiple components drive the bus simultaneously, PC updates occur only during appropriate operations, all paths return to s_18, memory operations follow proper sequences, and JSR correctly saves the return address before jumping."), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'ports_assignment': '59/60', 'state_transitions': '17/25', 'formatting': '9/15'}, 'score': 86}
