For ALU operations like ADD, AND, and NOT, the ALU must be connected to the bus (gateALU=1), registers must be loaded (ld_reg=1), and condition codes updated (ld_cc=1). For memory operations like LDR and STR, memory signals must be activated (mem_en=1), with appropriate read/write selection (mem_we=0/1). Control flow instructions (BR, JMP, JSR) require PC updates (ld_pc=1).\n\nFor the state machine implementation, I identified the current execution state for each instruction based on the provided state list. For multi-cycle instructions like LDR and STR, I mapped out the complete sequence of states required for memory operations. For BR, I specified both taken and not-taken paths. JSR requires two states: one for saving the return address and another for the actual jump.\n\nI was careful to ensure all execution paths eventually return to s_18 (fetch cycle), and that control signals comply with the hardware safety constraints (no multiple components driving the bus simultaneously). For memory operations, I ensured proper sequencing through the memory access states as specified in the requirements.'), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'ports_assignment': '59/60', 'state_transitions': '14.0/25', 'formatting': '9/15'}, 'score': 82}
