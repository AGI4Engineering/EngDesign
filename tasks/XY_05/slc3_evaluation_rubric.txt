SLC-3 CPU Evaluation Rubric (Revised, No Reasoning)

This rubric reflects the updated `evaluate_no_reasoning.py` scoring, which removes the reasoning component and redistributes its weight across control signals, state transitions, and formatting.

1. Control Signal Assignment – 60 points
- Each instruction contributes equally toward the control signal score.
- There are 9 instructions × 8 signals = 72 signal slots total.
- Each signal is evaluated against a reference:
  - 1 point — exactly matches reference value
  - 0.5 point — alternate valid but suboptimal
  - 0 point — incorrect or missing
- Total is normalized to 60 points.

Key Constraints (Critical Checkpoints):
- No bus contention: gateALU and gateMDR must not both be 1
- Memory write requires enable: if mem_we = 1, then mem_en must also = 1
- LDR must update condition codes: ld_cc = 1
- JSR must save return address: ld_reg = 1

Any constraint violation → 0 points for that instruction.

2. State Transition Mapping – 25 points
- Each instruction’s state mapping is evaluated:
  - 1 point — correct "current" state
  - 1 point — correct "next" (or "next_taken"/"next_not_taken")
  - 1 point — complete "sequence" for multi-cycle instructions or BR

Requirement by type:
- Single-cycle: current + next
- Multi-cycle (e.g., LDR, STR): complete sequence
- BR: next_taken + next_not_taken + sequence_taken

3. Format and Completeness – 15 points
- Instruction coverage (5 points): All 9 instructions present
- Field completeness (5 points): All 8 control signals per instruction
- JSON formatting (5 points): All values are strings, sequences comma-separated, no arrays

4. Critical Error Penalties
Any of the following → instruction scores 0 in control signals(score-20):
- Bus conflict (e.g., gateALU = 1 and gateMDR = 1)
- mem_we = 1 but mem_en = 0
- Missing required flags for JSR, LDR, etc.

Passing Threshold
- Final score ≥ 85 / 100
- No critical errors
- All 9 instructions fully specified
