{'completion_tokens': 5180, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design the car setup, I need to balance four parameters while meeting the constraints (runtime < 10 sec, off-track error < 1 meter, budget < 300 dollars).\n\nFirst, I'll calculate what's needed to complete the 56-meter track in under 10 seconds:\n\n1. For the runtime constraint: The car needs to accelerate from rest, reach a max velocity, and cover 56 meters.\n   - Time to reach max velocity = max_velocity / acceleration\n   - Distance covered during acceleration = 0.5 × (max_velocity)² / acceleration\n   - Remaining distance = 56 - distance during acceleration\n   - Time at constant velocity = remaining distance / max_velocity\n   - Total time = acceleration time + constant velocity time\n\n2. For the off-track error: Higher refresh rates allow more frequent course corrections, while appropriate lookahead distance helps anticipate turns.\n\n3. For the budget: I need to calculate the costs of each parameter:\n   - Refresh rate: 5 $/Hz\n   - Acceleration: 10 $/m/s²\n   - Max velocity: 8 $/m/s\n   - Lookahead distance: 1 $/meter\n\nAfter analyzing various configurations, I've optimized for:\n- A high refresh rate (35 Hz) to enable frequent adjustments and minimize off-track error\n- Moderate acceleration (2.5 m/s²) for balanced control\n- Reasonable max velocity (9 m/s) to complete the track quickly\n- Sufficient lookahead distance (8 meters) to anticipate curves\n\nWith these parameters:\n- Time calculation: 3.6 seconds to reach max velocity (covering 16.2 meters) + 4.42 seconds at max velocity = 8.02 seconds total\n- Budget: (35×5) + (2.5×10) + (9×8) + (8×1) = $280, under the $300 limit\n- The high refresh rate combined with suitable lookahead distance should keep off-track error under 1 meter", config=ConfigFile(refresh_rate=35, acceleration=2.5, max_velocity=9.0, lookahead_distance=8.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'total_cost': None, 'total_time': None, 'off_track_error': 1.0069285235347887, 'cost': 280.0}, 'score': 0}
