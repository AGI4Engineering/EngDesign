{'completion_tokens': 538, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To solve this task, we need to configure the car's parameters such that it meets the constraints of runtime, off-track error, and budget. Let's break down the requirements and constraints:\n\n1. **Total Runtime < 10 sec**: The car needs to complete a 56-meter track in less than 10 seconds. This implies that the average velocity should be at least 5.6 m/s (since 56 meters / 10 seconds = 5.6 m/s).\n\n2. **Max Off-Track Error < 1 meter**: This requires precise control, which can be influenced by the refresh rate and lookahead distance. A higher refresh rate and appropriate lookahead distance can help maintain the car on track.\n\n3. **Budget Cost < 300 dollars**: The costs are as follows:\n   - Refresh rate: 5 dollars per Hz\n   - Acceleration: 10 dollars per m/s²\n   - Max velocity: 8 dollars per m/s\n   - Lookahead distance: 1 dollar per meter\n\nTo meet these constraints, we need to balance the parameters:\n\n- **Refresh Rate**: A higher refresh rate improves control but increases cost. We need a reasonable refresh rate to ensure the car can adjust its path quickly enough to stay on track.\n\n- **Acceleration**: Determines how quickly the car can reach its max velocity. A moderate acceleration is needed to ensure the car can reach its max velocity quickly enough to complete the track in time.\n\n- **Max Velocity**: Needs to be high enough to ensure the car can complete the track in under 10 seconds.\n\n- **Lookahead Distance**: Affects the car's ability to anticipate the track and stay on course. A reasonable lookahead distance is needed to minimize off-track error.\n\nLet's choose the parameters:\n\n- **Refresh Rate**: 10 Hz (costs 50 dollars)\n- **Acceleration**: 5 m/s² (costs 50 dollars)\n- **Max Velocity**: 8 m/s (costs 64 dollars)\n- **Lookahead Distance**: 10 meters (costs 10 dollars)\n\nTotal cost = 50 + 50 + 64 + 10 = 174 dollars, which is within the budget.\n\nThese parameters should allow the car to complete the track in under 10 seconds with minimal off-track error, while staying within budget.", config=ConfigFile(refresh_rate=10, acceleration=5.0, max_velocity=8.0, lookahead_distance=10.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'total_cost': None, 'total_time': None, 'off_track_error': 1.0208829055261883, 'cost': 174.0}, 'score': 0}
