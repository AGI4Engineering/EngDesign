{"completion_tokens": 5635, "response": "reasoning='To meet the competition requirements, the car must finish the 56m track in under 10 seconds, stay within 1m off-track, and cost under $300. The solution balances these constraints as follows:\\n\\n1. **Time Optimization**:\\n   - Max velocity (V) = 8 m/s ensures the car can cover 56m in 9 seconds when paired with acceleration (a) = 3 m/s\u00b2. Calculations: Acceleration phase time = V/a \u2248 2.67s, distance covered = 0.5*a*t\u00b2 \u2248 10.67m. Remaining distance at V=8m/s takes \u22485.67s.
