{'completion_tokens': 4293, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To solve this problem, I need to balance the car's performance (speed and track accuracy) within the budget constraints. First, I'll analyze what contributes to each requirement:\n\n1. Runtime < 10 seconds: This requires sufficient speed to cover 56 meters quickly. The key factors are acceleration and max velocity.\n2. Off-track error < 1 meter: This requires good control, affected by refresh rate and lookahead distance.\n3. Budget < $300: Each parameter has a cost ($5/Hz for refresh rate, $10/(m/s²) for acceleration, $8/(m/s) for max velocity, $1/meter for lookahead).\n\nFor runtime calculation, I need to consider the acceleration phase and constant velocity phase:\n- Time to reach max velocity: t_acc = max_velocity / acceleration\n- Distance during acceleration: d_acc = 0.5 * acceleration * t_acc²\n- Distance at max velocity: d_max = 56 - d_acc\n- Time at max velocity: t_max = d_max / max_velocity\n- Total runtime: T = t_acc + t_max\n\nAfter several iterations, I found an optimal configuration:\n- Refresh rate: 35 Hz (cost: $175)\n- Acceleration: 4 m/s² (cost: $40)\n- Max velocity: 8 m/s (cost: $64)\n- Lookahead distance: 10 meters (cost: $10)\n\nTotal cost: $289 (under $300)\n\nWith this configuration:\n- Time to reach max velocity: 2 seconds\n- Distance covered during acceleration: 8 meters\n- Time at max velocity: 6 seconds\n- Total runtime: 8 seconds (under 10 seconds)\n\nThis setup provides a good balance between speed (for runtime) and control (high refresh rate and adequate lookahead for tracking accuracy), all within budget.", config=ConfigFile(refresh_rate=35, acceleration=4.0, max_velocity=8.0, lookahead_distance=10.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'total_cost': None, 'total_time': None, 'off_track_error': 1.0440801172003784, 'cost': 289.0}, 'score': 0}
