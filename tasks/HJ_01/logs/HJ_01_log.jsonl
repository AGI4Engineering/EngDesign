{'trial': 0, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To solve the problem, we need to configure the car with specific parameters including refresh rate, acceleration, max velocity, and lookahead distance. Our goal is to satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The total runtime to complete the 56-meter path must be less than 10 seconds.\n2. The maximum off-track error should be less than 1 meter.\n3. The total cost needs to stay under 300 dollars.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n#### 1. Determine Maximum Velocity\nGiven a 10-second goal to complete a 56-meter path, the minimum average velocity should be:\n\n- Velocity = Distance / Time = 56 meters / 10 seconds = 5.6 m/s\n\nTherefore, setting the `max_velocity` to slightly higher value like 6 m/s to allow some flexibility in acceleration and deceleration phases.\n\n#### 2. Determine Acceleration\nWith a 6 m/s max velocity, we need sufficient acceleration to reach this speed quickly. A reasonable acceleration might be around 1 m/s² to cover both speed and cost considerations.\n  \n#### 3. Set Refresh Rate\nThe refresh rate primarily impacts control accuracy. A higher refresh rate improves control but comes at a cost. A moderate refresh rate of 30 Hz should give us a good balance between responsiveness and cost.\n\n#### 4. Define Lookahead Distance\nThe lookahead camera distance needs to be set to maintain a maximum off-track error of less than 1 meter. For a safe distance, a mid-range of 20 meters is effective.\n\n### Calculate Costs\n- Refresh Rate Cost = 30 Hz * $5 = $150\n- Acceleration Cost = 1 m/s² * $10 = $10\n- Max Velocity Cost = 6 m/s * $8 = $48\n- Lookahead Distance Cost = 20 meters * $1 = $20\n\nTotal cost = $150 + $10 + $48 + $20 = $228, which is within the $300 budget.\n\nWith these settings, the car should meet the runtime and tracking accuracy requirements within the budget.', config=ConfigFile(refresh_rate=30, acceleration=1.0, max_velocity=6.0, lookahead_distance=20.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'total_cost': None, 'total_time': None, 'off_track_error': np.float64(1.0338684982168524), 'cost': 228.0}, 'score': 0, 'confidence': 100}
