{"completion_tokens": 2182, "response": "reasoning=\"To meet the competition requirements, we need to optimize the parameters within the budget while ensuring the car completes the 56m path in under 10 seconds and stays within 1m track-off error. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\\n\\n1. **Time Constraint**: The car must average at least 5.6 m/s (56m/10s). Choosing a max velocity of 8 m/s allows the car to finish in 7 seconds at full speed, but acceleration and control must be considered.\\n2. **Acceleration**: At 4 m/s\u00b2, the car reaches 8 m/s in 2 seconds, covering 8m during acceleration. Remaining distance (48m) is covered in 6 seconds at 8 m/s, totaling 8 seconds.\\n3. **Lookahead Distance**: Set to 4m, proportional to max velocity (0.5s lookahead time), balancing tracking accuracy and stability to keep off-track error <1m.\\n4. **Refresh Rate**: 30 Hz ensures frequent control updates for smooth path following.\\n5. **Budget**: Total cost = (30Hz * $5) + (4m/s\u00b2 * $10) + (8m/s * $8) + (4m * $1) = $258, under $300.\\n\\nThis configuration satisfies all constraints.\" config=ConfigFile(refresh_rate=30, acceleration=4.0, max_velocity=8.0, lookahead_distance=4.0)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"total_cost": null, "total_time": null, "off_track_error": 1.0942946463101544, "cost": 258.0}, "score": 0}
