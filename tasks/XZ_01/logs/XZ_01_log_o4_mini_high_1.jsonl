{'completion_tokens': 7601, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='We model the site as a 50×40 4-connected grid with the given obstacle walls and clusters.  \n1. Vertical wall at x=10 (y=5…35) blocks column x=10 for y≥5 and y≤35.  \n2. Horizontal wall at y=20 (x=10…40) blocks row y=20 for x=10…40.  \n3. Vertical wall at x=30 (y=0…15).  \n4. Dense block at x∈[20,25], y∈[25,30].  \n5. Scattered points at (15,10),(25,5),(35,25),(40,30),(45,15).  \n\nUsing A* with the Manhattan heuristic, we search on the 4-connected graph.  We find that the shortest collision-free corridor stays entirely below the large horizontal barrier until the far right side and then climbs to the goal.  Specifically:  \n• Segment 1: East from (0,0) to (10,0)  \n• Segment 2: North to (10,4) – crosses the x=10 wall at its gap at y=4  \n• Segment 3: East one step to (11,4)  \n• Segment 4: North to (11,16) – reaches above the x=30 wall (which ends at y=15)  \n• Segment 5: East to (30,16) – steps into x=30 at y=16 (gap in that wall)  \n• Segment 6: East to (49,16) – remains below the y=20 wall until past its end at x=40  \n• Segment 7: North to (49,39) – climbs to the goal, unobstructed  \n\nThis produces 89 grid nodes (0,0 → 49,39) and 88 one-meter moves.
