{'completion_tokens': 264, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The task is to implement a parameterized Gray-to-binary converter in SystemVerilog. The module should take a Gray code input of WIDTH bits and output its binary equivalent, also of WIDTH bits. The conversion algorithm involves XORing the Gray code bits with the preceding binary bits. A generate-for loop construct will be used to efficiently implement the XOR cascade for optimal synthesis and readability. The MSB of binary is same as the MSB of Gray. Then the remaining bits of binary are computed by XORing the binary bits with the corresponding Gray bits.
