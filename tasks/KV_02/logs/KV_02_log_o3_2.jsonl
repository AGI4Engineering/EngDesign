{'completion_tokens': 887, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Balancing-current window.\n   • In switched-capacitor topologies the instantaneous current spikes can be high, but the average current seen by a cell is normally limited to a small fraction of the cell rated current (C/20 … C/5) so that temperature rise and ageing stay negligible.\n   • For 18650/21700-type Li-ion cells (2–3 Ah) a practical average balancing current lies between ≈50 mA and 500 mA.  \n   • 50 mA (0.05 A) is the lowest level that still produces a measurable SOC equalisation in a reasonable time (< several hours) while remaining well below the self-discharge rate.  \n   • 500 mA (0.5 A) corresponds to roughly C/5 for a 2.5 Ah cell – high enough for fast balancing but still far away from the normal charge/discharge rates, therefore unlikely to upset the CC-CV loop or create thermal stress.\n\n2. Relay hysteresis (on/off thresholds).\n   • The pack starts with SOC spread 0.70 – 0.80.  \n   • We want to stop charging once the *highest* cell approaches its CV knee to prevent over-voltage; 0.80 (80 %) is a conservative value, leaving margin to 100 %.\n   • We want to re-enable charging only after the balancing phase has lowered the highest cell and raised the lowest one; 0.60 (60 %) gives a 20 % hysteresis band that prevents relay chattering while allowing a full balancing interval.\n\n3. Consistency with CC-CV block.\n   • vMax is 4.1 V, so 80 % SOC is ~3.9–4.0 V for most Li-ion chemistries, comfortably below vMax.  \n   • At 60 % SOC the voltage is ~3.7 V, far from the CV region, so the CC-CV controller will stay in CC mode and the balancing current window will be valid.\n\nHence the selected numeric parameters satisfy safe thermal limits, give a clear hysteresis for the relay logic, and are compatible with the existing CC-CV controller.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.05, highest_current=0.5, on_threshold=0.8, off_threshold=0.6)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.05, 'highest_current': 0.5, 'on_threshold': 0.8, 'off_threshold': 0.6, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
