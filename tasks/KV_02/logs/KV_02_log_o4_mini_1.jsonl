{'completion_tokens': 2366, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. We have three Li-ion cells in series with initial SOCs of 70%, 75% and 80%. Active balancing will transfer charge from higher-SOC cell(s) to lower-SOC cell(s) using bidirectional switches and capacitors.\n2. To make meaningful balancing progress without causing SOC instability or excessive stress, balancing currents should be kept in the tens to low hundreds of milliamps (assuming a typical cell capacity of a few ampere-hours).\n3. We choose a lowest_current of 0.05 A (50 mA). At this rate, a 2 Ah cell would shift about 2.5% SOC per hour—slow but still practical for fine adjustments.\n4. We choose a highest_current of 0.20 A (200 mA). At this rate, the same 2 Ah cell would shift about 10% SOC per hour, allowing the ~5% SOC imbalance to be corrected within about 30 minutes.\n5. To avoid rapid on/off cycling of the relay, we introduce a small hysteresis band around the highest cell’s SOC. With the highest initial SOC at 80%, we set:\n   • on_threshold = 0.78 SOC: when any cell reaches 78%, charging is stopped and balancing (discharge pulses) begins.\n   • off_threshold = 0.76 SOC: when that cell falls back to 76%, charging resumes.\n6. This 2% hysteresis prevents chatter and ensures the cells are gently brought into balance before re-enabling charging.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.05, highest_current=0.2, on_threshold=0.78, off_threshold=0.76)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.05, 'highest_current': 0.2, 'on_threshold': 0.78, 'off_threshold': 0.76, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
