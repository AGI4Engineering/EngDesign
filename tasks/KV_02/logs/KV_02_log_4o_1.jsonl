{'completion_tokens': 315, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design the control parameters for the Switched Capacitor Battery Balancing System, we need to ensure safe and efficient balancing of the three Li-ion battery cells. The initial SOC values are 0.70, 0.75, and 0.80 for cells 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The goal is to balance these cells without causing instability or overcharging.\n\n1. **Lowest Current**: This should be a small value that allows balancing to progress without causing excessive heat or inefficiency. A value of 0.1 A is reasonable for a small balancing current.\n\n2. **Highest Current**: This should be high enough to allow effective balancing but not so high as to cause SOC instability or damage. A value of 2.0 A is a safe upper limit for balancing current.\n\n3. **On Threshold**: The SOC level at which the relay should stop charging should be close to the maximum SOC of the cells to prevent overcharging. A value of 0.85 is appropriate, as it is slightly above the initial highest SOC.\n\n4. **Off Threshold**: The SOC level at which the relay should resume charging should be lower than the initial SOC values to ensure that charging resumes only when necessary. A value of 0.65 is suitable, as it is below the initial lowest SOC.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.1, highest_current=2.0, on_threshold=0.85, off_threshold=0.65)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.1, 'highest_current': 2.0, 'on_threshold': 0.85, 'off_threshold': 0.65, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
