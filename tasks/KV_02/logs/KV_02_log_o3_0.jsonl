{'completion_tokens': 889, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Battery cell capacity for small-medium Li-ion modules is usually in the 2–3 Ah range. Good balancing practice uses 0.05 C–0.5 C so that temperature rise and cell voltage excursion stay moderate.\n2. 0.05 C for a 2 Ah cell ≈ 0.1 A. Anything below this makes the energy shuffled by the two switched capacitors so small that observable equalisation takes many hours. Therefore we choose 0.1 A as the lowest useful current.\n3. At the other extreme, going much above ≈0.5 C may drive the highest-voltage cell past the 4.1 V ceiling between PWM pulses or cause the lowest-voltage cell to collapse when the capacitors dump charge. 0.5 C for 2 Ah ≈ 1 A. Adding a 50 % safety margin to accommodate estimation error gives 1.5 A as an absolute ceiling that is still well under typical 1 C charge/discharge capability, so we adopt 1.5 A.\n4. Relay hysteresis: we want to stop charging a string once every cell is ‘full enough’ so the balancer only has to shuttle excess energy, and we want to restart charge after the cells settle. Stopping at 82 % SOC leaves room for the highest cell to climb a few percent during the last CV phase without exceeding 100 %. Restarting when average SOC falls to 75 % provides a 7 % band—large enough to avoid relay chatter yet small enough to keep throughput high.\n5. These values harmonise with the existing PI loop (vMax = 4.1 V, Kp = 100, Ki = 10) and with the 0.006 s, 50 % duty, 180°-interleaved PWM, ensuring the switches and capacitors are never driven with currents above their design rating while still guaranteeing observable balancing in minutes rather than hours.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.1, highest_current=1.5, on_threshold=0.82, off_threshold=0.75)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.1, 'highest_current': 1.5, 'on_threshold': 0.82, 'off_threshold': 0.75, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
