{'completion_tokens': 335, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design the control parameters for the Switched Capacitor Battery Balancing System, we need to ensure safe and efficient balancing of the three Li-ion cells. The initial SOCs are 0.70, 0.75, and 0.80, indicating a need for balancing. The PWM switching with a 50% duty cycle and 180Â° interleaving will help in efficient energy transfer between cells. The CC-CV control with vMax = 4.1 V and PI controller (Kp = 100, Ki = 10) will manage the charging process.\n\n1. **Lowest Current**: This should be low enough to allow gradual balancing without causing excessive heat or stress on the cells. A value of 0.1 A is reasonable for safe balancing.\n\n2. **Highest Current**: This should be high enough to allow effective balancing but not so high as to cause SOC instability or damage. A value of 2.0 A is a safe upper limit for balancing current.\n\n3. **On Threshold**: The SOC level at which charging should stop to prevent overcharging. Setting this at 0.85 ensures cells do not exceed safe SOC levels.\n\n4. **Off Threshold**: The SOC level at which charging should resume to maintain efficiency. Setting this at 0.65 ensures cells are charged efficiently without deep discharge.\n\nThese values ensure the system operates within safe limits while effectively balancing the cells.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.1, highest_current=2.0, on_threshold=0.85, off_threshold=0.65)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.1, 'highest_current': 2.0, 'on_threshold': 0.85, 'off_threshold': 0.65, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
