{'completion_tokens': 870, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. In an active switched-capacitor balancing system the balancing current can be modulated by PWM of the MOSFETs.  For typical small/medium size Li-ion cells (≈2 Ah) it is good practice to keep the balancing current between 0.05 C and 0.5 C so that:\n   • it is large enough to move charge in a reasonable time, but\n   • it does not over-stress the weakest cell or introduce large SOC estimation error.\n   0.05 C → 0.1 A ; 0.5 C → 1 A for a 2 Ah cell.\n   Therefore:\n   lowest_current  = 0.10 A (anything smaller would take too long to equalise even a 5 % SOC gap).\n   highest_current = 1.00 A (keeps ΔT and voltage overshoot within safe limits and is well under the 1 C continuous rating of most cylindrical cells).\n\n2. Relay hysteresis (on/off SOC thresholds) must:\n   • avoid chattering (provide some gap),\n   • keep the pack in the healthy 20-80 % band,\n   • ensure Cell-3 (initially at 0.80 SOC) immediately enters discharge mode so that charge is transferred to the lower cells.\n\n   A good pair is:\n   on_threshold  = 0.78  (charge is stopped / discharge starts once any cell crosses 78 % – this will trip at t = 0 for Cell-3). \n   off_threshold = 0.70  (charging resumes only after the highest cell has been bled down to 70 %, giving an 8 % hysteresis window which is large enough to prevent relay oscillation at the chosen balancing currents).\n\nThe four numeric parameters therefore balance safety, speed and stability for the given architecture and controller gains.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.1, highest_current=1.0, on_threshold=0.78, off_threshold=0.7)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.1, 'highest_current': 1.0, 'on_threshold': 0.78, 'off_threshold': 0.7, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
