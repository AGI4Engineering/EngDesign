{'completion_tokens': 1316, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Below are suggested control set-points to ensure safe yet sufficiently strong balancing currents and a practical hysteresis for triggering charge/discharge. The “lowest_current” is set low enough to make progress even at small current flow, while “highest_current” is high enough to actively speed up balancing without undo SOC swings. The two SOC thresholds create a manageable hysteresis region to turn off charging near the top of the capacity and re-enable charging after some discharge. These values keep the battery in a comfortable SOC window and provide reliable balancing for the three cells.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.2, highest_current=2.0, on_threshold=0.95, off_threshold=0.9)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.2, 'highest_current': 2.0, 'on_threshold': 0.95, 'off_threshold': 0.9, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 0, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 60}
