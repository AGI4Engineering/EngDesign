{"completion_tokens": 562, "response": "reasoning=\"The task is to propose four numerical control parameters for a switched capacitor battery balancing system based on the provided description, system diagram, and SOC graph.\\n1. `on_threshold`: This parameter defines the State of Charge (SOC) level at which the main charging relay stops charging the battery pack. Observing the provided SOC graph, the cell with the highest initial SOC (Cell 3) reaches a peak SOC of approximately 0.85 before the overall pack SOC starts to decrease (indicating discharge or cessation of charging). Therefore, 0.85 is proposed as the `on_threshold`.\\n2. `off_threshold`: This parameter defines the SOC level at which the main charging relay resumes charging the battery pack after a period of discharge or rest. This value must be lower than `on_threshold` to create a hysteresis. A value of 0.70 is proposed for `off_threshold`. This creates a 0.15 SOC hysteresis band (0.70-0.85). The system starts charging with initial cell SOCs of 0.70, 0.75, and 0.80 (max 0.80). This initiation of charging is consistent if the system is set to charge as long as the SOC is below `on_threshold` and not necessarily only if it drops below `off_threshold` from a higher state, or if it's the first charge cycle.\\n3. `lowest_current`: This is the smallest balancing current in Amperes considered to allow reasonable balancing progress. For active balancing systems to be effective and overcome internal cell differences or self-discharge variations in a practical timeframe, a certain minimum current is required. A value of 0.2 A is proposed as a sensible lower limit for typical Li-ion cells where balancing is intended to make a noticeable impact.\\n4. `highest_current`: This is the maximum allowable balancing current in Amperes that the system should use without risking SOC instability, excessive cell stress, or damage to balancing components. The main charging current for the pack appears to be 4 A (from the 'Constant 4' block in the diagram). Balancing currents are usually a fraction of the main charging current. A value of 1.0 A is proposed as a reasonable upper limit for balancing current, allowing for relatively quick balancing without being overly aggressive for common Li-ion cell capacities.\" config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.2, highest_current=1.0, on_threshold=0.85, off_threshold=0.7)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"lowest_current": 0.2, "highest_current": 1.0, "on_threshold": 0.85, "off_threshold": 0.7, "score_breakdown": {"lowest_current_valid": 0, "highest_current_safe": 0, "current_ordering_valid": 20, "threshold_range_valid": 20, "threshold_ordering_valid": 20}}, "score": 60}
