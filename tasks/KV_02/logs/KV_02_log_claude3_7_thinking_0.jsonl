{'completion_tokens': 1856, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design control parameters for the Switched Capacitor Battery Balancing System, I need to analyze both the circuit schematic and the SOC graph provided.\n\n1. For `lowest_current`:\n   - This needs to be large enough to enable meaningful balancing progress\n   - Looking at typical active balancing systems with capacitor-based topologies\n   - Too low would make balancing ineffectively slow\n   - A value of 0.2A provides reasonable balancing capability while being conservative\n\n2. For `highest_current`:\n   - Maximum safe current without causing SOC instability\n   - The system uses PWM switching (6ms period) and has PI control (Kp=100, Ki=10)\n   - Must consider cell safety and switching losses\n   - 1.5A represents a reasonable upper limit for safe active balancing with this architecture\n\n3. For `on_threshold`:\n   - From the SOC graph, cells initially charge up to around 0.85-0.87 before discharging\n   - This value should be above all initial cell SOCs (0.7, 0.75, 0.8)\n   - 0.85 represents a good threshold to stop charging and begin discharge\n\n4. For `off_threshold`:\n   - Need sufficient separation from on_threshold to prevent excessive toggling\n   - Should be below the lowest initial SOC (0.7) to create effective cycling\n   - From the graph, cells discharge to around 0.5-0.6\n   - 0.6 provides a reasonable lower threshold to resume charging', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.2, highest_current=1.5, on_threshold=0.85, off_threshold=0.6)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.2, 'highest_current': 1.5, 'on_threshold': 0.85, 'off_threshold': 0.6, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 0, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 60}
