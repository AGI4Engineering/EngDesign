Establish practical C-rate window\n   • Small, 3-series Li-ion string is typically rated between 1 Ah – 4 Ah.  \n   • A conservative ‘balancing window’ is 0.05 C – 0.5 C (to avoid overheating and SOC oscillation).\n   • Assuming a mid-range 2 Ah cell, this translates to roughly 0.1 A – 1 A.  Because the architecture can momentarily move more current (switched-capacitor bursts) we leave some head-room and cap at 2 A.\n\n2. lowest_current  (progress must still be observable)\n   • Must exceed self-discharge / leakage (≈ few mA) and ESR losses.\n   • ≥ 0.05 A will physically move ≈0.18 C in 1 h on a 2 Ah cell, visibly equalising within minutes of simulation.\n   • Rounded to 0.10 A for margin and easier PWM scaling.\n\n3. highest_current  (no SOC instability / heating)\n   • Keep well below 1 C; 0.5 C (≈1 A for 2 Ah) is safe continuous.  \n   • For short switched-capacitor pulses we can double that while staying below temperature limits → 2 A.\n\n4. on_threshold  (relay turns OFF charging, starts discharging)\n   • Highest initial SOC is 0.80.  We allow a small charge head-room before toggling.\n   • 0.82 chosen (≈2 % above the highest starting cell) – avoids premature cut-off but still protects from over-charge.\n\n5. off_threshold  (relay turns ON charging again)\n   • Needs hysteresis so the relay does not chatter.\n   • A 4 % gap is typical; therefore off_threshold = 0.78.\n\nThese four numbers give:  \n• Low current large enough to overcome parasitics,  \n• High current still <0.5 C average,  \n• 4 % SOC hysteresis around the 0.8 region to stabilise toggling while ensuring the system never approaches the 4.1 V ceiling.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.1, highest_current=2.0, on_threshold=0.82, off_threshold=0.78)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.1, 'highest_current': 2.0, 'on_threshold': 0.82, 'off_threshold': 0.78, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
