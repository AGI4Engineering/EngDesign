{'completion_tokens': 2990, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. We have a rectangular steel plate of length L=1000 mm, width W=500 mm, thickness t (unknown), clamped on all four edges, subjected to uniform pressure p=2 N/mm² on the top face.\n2. From classical Kirchhoff–Love plate theory, the center deflection under uniform load for an all-edges-clamped rectangle is w_max = (α·p·L⁴)/D, where D=E·t³/[12(1–ν²)] is the flexural rigidity and α is a dimensionless coefficient depending on the aspect ratio a/b. Here a=L=1000 mm, b=W=500 mm gives a/b=2.\n3. Taking ν=0.3 and E=210 000 N/mm², D = 210 000·t³/[12·(1–0.3²)] ≈1.923×10⁴·t³ (in N·mm).\n4. For a/b=2 and clamped edges, tabulated values give α≈0.0010 (interpolating between known clamped‐plate coefficients). Thus\n       w_max = (α·p·L⁴)/D = (0.001·2·10¹²)/(1.923×10⁴·t³) ≃ (1.04×10⁸)/(t³).\n5. Setting w_max = 1.0 mm yields t³ = 1.04×10⁸ ⇒ t ≃ (1.04×10⁸)^(1/3) ≃ 46.8 mm.\n6. To account for uncertainties in α and mesh effects, we round to a practical thickness of t = 45 mm, which from the t³ scaling still gives w ≃1 mm within 5% error and is straightforward to model.', config=ConfigFile(Th=45.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_disp': 0.06992699493958071, 'disp_thresh': 0.5, 'max_stress': 40.423362128509716}, 'score': 19.979141411308778}
