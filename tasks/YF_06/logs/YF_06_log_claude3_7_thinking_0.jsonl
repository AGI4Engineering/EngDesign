For a rectangular plate (1000×500×t mm) with all edges fixed under uniform pressure of 2 N/mm², the maximum deflection can be calculated with the formula w_max = α(pa⁴/D), where D is the flexural rigidity. With an aspect ratio of 2, coefficient α ≈ 0.00254, and flexural rigidity D = 19,230.8×t³, I derived the relationship between thickness and displacement. Targeting a displacement of 0.4 mm (80% of the 0.5 mm threshold), I calculated t ≈ 34.7 mm. Rounding to 35 mm gives a predicted maximum displacement of 0.385 mm, which is 77% of the threshold - within the optimal 70-90% range.', config=ConfigFile(Th=35.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_disp': 0.11197041093706445, 'disp_thresh': 0.5, 'max_stress': 54.542953305548835}, 'score': 31.991545982018415}
