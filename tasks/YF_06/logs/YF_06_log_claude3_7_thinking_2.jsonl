For a rectangular plate with all edges fixed and under uniform pressure, the maximum deflection occurs at the center and can be calculated using the formula: w_max = (α × q × a⁴) / (E × t³), where α is a coefficient based on the aspect ratio (approximately 0.0116 for a/b = 0.5), q is the uniform pressure (2 N/mm²), a is the shorter dimension (500 mm), E is Young's modulus (210,000 N/mm²), and t is the plate thickness. Solving for t with a target deflection of 1.0 mm: 1.0 mm = (0.0116 × 2 × 500⁴) / (210,000 × t³), which gives t³ = 6,904.76, resulting in t ≈ 19 mm.", config=ConfigFile(Th=19.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_disp': 0.4394975246250611, 'disp_thresh': 0.5, 'max_stress': 154.84704276288443}, 'score': 100.0}
