{'completion_tokens': 7276, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To determine the suitable thickness (t) for the steel plate ensuring maximum displacement δ_max < 0.5 mm under the given load, plate bending theory for a clamped rectangular plate was applied. The formula δ_max = (C * p * L^4) / (E * t^3) was used, where C ≈ 0.0277 (for aspect ratio L/W=2). Rearranging for t, calculations yielded t ≈ 80 mm to limit δ_max to ~0.5 mm. This accounts for the cube-law relationship between thickness and bending stiffness, ensuring the displacement stays below the threshold while balancing structural efficiency. The result aligns with the performance criterion's requirement for δ_max < 0.5 mm.", config=ConfigFile(Th=80.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_disp': 0.026128694838445127, 'disp_thresh': 0.5, 'max_stress': 15.079267342482833}, 'score': 7.465341382412893}
