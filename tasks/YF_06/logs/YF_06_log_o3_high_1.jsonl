Identify the problem data \n   • Planform : 1000 mm (long side, a) × 500 mm (short side, b);  b/a = 0.50  (aspect-ratio 2:1).\n   • Boundary : all four edges clamped (built-in).\n   • Load      : uniform pressure p = 2 N/mm² ( = 2 MPa ).\n   • Material  : E = 210 000 N/mm²,  ν = 0.30.\n   • Target    : keep the maximum transverse deflection below 0.5 mm and, ideally, between 70 % and 90 % of that limit (0.35–0.45 mm) to obtain the full score.\n\n2.  Adopt classical thin-plate theory (Kirchhoff–Love).  For a fully clamped rectangular plate under a uniform transverse pressure the central deflection is\n        w_max = K · ( q · a⁴ ) / ( E · t³ )\n    where q is the pressure, a the longer side, t the thickness and K is a non-dimensional coefficient that depends on b/a and on the edge conditions.\n\n3.  Take the coefficient from Roark’s Formulas for Stress and Strain, Case 14 (all edges fixed, uniform load):\n        for b/a = 0.50   →   K ≈ 0.0090  ( ν = 0.30 )\n    [For a square plate K = 0.00406; the larger value for b/a = 0.50 reflects the greater flexibility produced by the high aspect ratio.]\n\n4.  Impose a design deflection of w_des = 0.40 mm (mid-range of the 0.35–0.45 mm criterion) and solve for t\n          t³ = K · q · a⁴ / ( E · w_des )\n          t³ = 0.0090 · ( 2 N/mm² ) · (1000 mm)⁴ / ( 210 000 N/mm² · 0.40 mm )\n          t³ = 0.0090 · 2 · 1.0×10¹² / 8.4×10⁴  ≈ 2.14×10⁵ mm³\n          t   ≈ (2.14×10⁵)^{1/3}  ≈ 60 mm\n\n5.  Check the predicted performance\n        w_max(pred) = 0.0090 · 2 · 1.0×10¹² / ( 210 000 · 60³ )\n                     ≈ 0.397 mm\n        Ratio to limit = 0.397 / 0.500 = 0.794  → inside 0.70–0.90  ⇒ full score expected.\n\n6.  Additional remarks\n   • A 60-mm plate is comfortably within the small-deflection assumptions: w/t ≈ 0.007 < 0.10.\n   • Any reasonable scatter in K (±10 %) still keeps δ within 0.35–0.45 mm (≈0.72–0.87 of the limit), so the choice is robust.\n\nConclusion – selecting t = 60 mm should give a maximum nodal displacement of about 0.40 mm, meeting the specification and securing a perfect evaluation score.', config=ConfigFile(Th=60.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_disp': 0.03803753620709479, 'disp_thresh': 0.5, 'max_stress': 26.93893408790354}, 'score': 10.86786748774137}
