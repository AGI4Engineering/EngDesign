{'completion_tokens': 8189, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A rough closed‐form estimate for the deflection of a fully clamped rectangular plate under uniform pressure can be written as δ ≈ k·p·L⁴ / (E·t³), where k is a dimensionless constant depending on the aspect ratio (L/W = 2), the boundary conditions, and Poisson’s ratio. For this plate (1\u202fm×0.5\u202fm, p=2\u202fN/mm², E=210\u202f000\u202fN/mm², ν=0.3), classical plate formulas suggest k is of the order of 0.01–0.02, leading to a relationship δ ∝ 1/t³. Solving numerically for a 1\u202fmm deflection yields a thickness around 50\u202fmm. This is a relatively large thickness but results from the large applied pressure (2\u202fMPa) over a fairly large surface area while constraining the maximum deflection to roughly 1\u202fmm.', config=ConfigFile(Th=50.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_disp': 0.05391509154750194, 'disp_thresh': 0.5, 'max_stress': 33.9700010027457}, 'score': 15.40431187071484}
