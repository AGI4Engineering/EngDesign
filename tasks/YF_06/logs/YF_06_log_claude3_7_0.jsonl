For a rectangular plate with fixed edges under uniform pressure, the maximum deflection can be calculated using: δ_max = α × (p × a⁴) / (E × t³), where α is a coefficient based on the plate's aspect ratio. With our parameters (p = 2 N/mm², a = 500 mm, E = 210,000 N/mm², aspect ratio = 2), and targeting a deflection of 0.4 mm (80% of the 0.5 mm threshold for optimal scoring), I calculated that t³ = (0.0138 × 2 × 500⁴) / (210,000 × 0.4), giving t ≈ 27.3 mm. Rounding up to account for manufacturing constraints, I determined that a thickness of 28 mm would be appropriate.", config=ConfigFile(Th=28.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_disp': 0.17568424972604088, 'disp_thresh': 0.5, 'max_stress': 77.75182188346999}, 'score': 50.195499921725975}
