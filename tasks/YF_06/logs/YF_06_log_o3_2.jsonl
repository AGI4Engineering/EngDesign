The maximum deflection must stay below 0.5 mm; an ideal target range for the competition score is 0.35–0.45 mm (70 %–90 % of the limit).\n\nStep 2 – Classical plate-theory estimate\nFor a rectangular, fully clamped plate with aspect ratio a/b = 2 (long side a = 1000 mm, short side b = 500 mm) the small-deflection plate theory gives\n    w_max = f(m)·q·b⁴ / D ,  with  m = a/b = 2\nwhere D = E·t³ / [12 (1-ν²)].  From Roark’s tables, the coefficient for uniform pressure and all edges fixed is f(2) ≈ 0.0020…0.0013.  Using the conservative mid-value f = 0.0016:\n    w_max ≈ 0.0016 · q · b⁴ · 12 (1-ν²)/(E·t³)\nPlugging the material constants (E = 210 000 MPa, ν = 0.30) and q = 2 N/mm² gives\n    w_max(mm) ≈ 1.0 × 10⁴ / t³\n\nStep 3 – Solve for the thickness that meets the 0.5 mm limit\nSet w_max = 0.5 mm and solve t:\n    0.5 = 1.0 × 10⁴ / t³  ⇒  t ≈ 27 mm\n\nStep 4 – Choose a thickness that hits the 70–90 % scoring window\nA slightly larger thickness will lower the deflection to ~0.4 mm (≈80 % of the limit), comfortably inside the optimal scoring range while giving a safety margin for modelling uncertainties.  Checking t = 30 mm:\n    w_max(30 mm) ≈ 1.0 × 10⁴ / 30³ ≈ 0.37 mm ( ≈ 74 % of the limit )\n\nStep 5 – Conclusion\nA plate thickness of 30 mm is expected to yield a maximum nodal displacement of roughly 0.35–0.40 mm under the specified loading, satisfying δ_max < 0.5 mm and placing the deflection ratio squarely in the 70–90 % band that earns full points.', config=ConfigFile(Th=30.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_disp': 0.16725848588354786, 'disp_thresh': 0.5, 'max_stress': 85.09282277905983}, 'score': 47.78813882387082}
