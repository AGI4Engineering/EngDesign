For a rectangular plate with fixed edges under uniform pressure, the maximum deflection can be calculated using: δ_max = α × (p × a⁴) / (E × t³), where α is a coefficient based on the aspect ratio and boundary conditions, p is the pressure, a is the shorter side length, E is Young's modulus, and t is the thickness. Given values: p = 2 N/mm², a = 500 mm, E = 210,000 N/mm², and aspect ratio = 2. For this configuration, α ≈ 0.0138. The target deflection should be between 70-90% of the 0.5 mm allowable maximum (0.35-0.45 mm). Aiming for 0.4 mm deflection (80% of limit), and solving for thickness: t³ = (α × p × a⁴) / (E × δ_max) = (0.0138 × 2 × 500⁴) / (210,000 × 0.4) ≈ 20,535.71, giving t ≈ 27.4 mm. I'll set the thickness at 27 mm, which should keep the deflection within the optimal range while minimizing material usage.", config=ConfigFile(Th=27.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_disp': 0.21700798756533715, 'disp_thresh': 0.5, 'max_stress': 104.85517979765744}, 'score': 62.0022821615249}
