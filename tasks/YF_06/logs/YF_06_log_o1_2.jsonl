The plate is 1000 mm by 500 mm (aspect ratio = 2).  From typical tables (e.g. Roark’s Formulas for Stress and Strain) or by scaling from a known result for a square plate, one finds α in the range of roughly 0.010 to 0.025.  In practice, setting α ≈ 0.014–0.020 gives an order‐of‐magnitude estimate.\n\n3) EXAMPLE CALCULATION (SCALING FROM A 500×500 SQUARE PLATE):  \n   • For a fully clamped 500×500 square plate, a known approximate formula is  \n         wₘₐₓ ≈ 0.0138 × (p × a⁴) / (E × t³)    (for ν ≈ 0.3).  \n   • Substituting a = 500 mm, p = 2 N/mm², and E = 210,000 N/mm² shows that around t = 20 mm yields ∼1 mm of deflection if it were just 500×500.  \n   • Doubling one dimension to 1000×500 increases the flexibility.  A rough scale factor suggests that t must increase by about (2)^(1/3) ≈ 1.26 to keep the same deflection.  So if 20 mm suffices for 1 mm deflection for 500×500, then about 25 mm is needed to keep the deflection near 1 mm for 1000×500.\n\n4) CONCLUSION:  \n   Although each reference formula or table may give slightly different numerical factors, a consistent estimation for a 1000×500×t mm rectangular steel plate (all edges fixed, uniform transverse pressure of 2 N/mm²) is that a thickness of around t ≈ 25 mm keeps the maximum deflection near 1.0 mm.\n\n   In summary, choosing t ≈ 25 mm (± a few mm depending on more precise plate‐theory coefficients) is a good first estimate to achieve about 1.0 mm of maximum out‐of‐plane deflection under the stated loading. This thickness is large, but the load of 2 MPa on a 1,000×500 mm area corresponds to a total force of 1,000,000 N—so a substantial thickness is required to keep deflections small.\n", config=ConfigFile(Th=25.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_disp': 0.27063476515437845, 'disp_thresh': 0.5, 'max_stress': 121.98832217222564}, 'score': 77.32421861553671}
