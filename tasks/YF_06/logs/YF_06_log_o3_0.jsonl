{'completion_tokens': 2238, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Objective: choose a plate thickness t that brings the maximum transverse displacement δ_max to roughly 0.4 mm (≈ 80 % of the 0.5 mm limit) so that the score falls in the 70–90 % ‘full-credit’ band.\n\n1. Geometry & load\n   • a = 1000 mm,  b = 500 mm (aspect ratio m = a/b = 2)\n   • Uniform pressure q = 2 N/mm²\n   • Edges: all four sides clamped (UX = UY = UZ = 0).\n\n2. Classical plate‐bending formula\n   For a rectangular plate with all edges fixed and uniform load, maximum deflection is\n        w_max = α · q · a⁴ / D ,\n      with  D = E t³ / [12(1–ν²)]  and α a coefficient that depends on m.\n   From Roark / Timoshenko tables for m = 2 (clamped): α ≈ 0.0020…0.0021.  \n\n3. Substitute numbers\n   • E = 210 000 N/mm²,  ν = 0.30  ⇒  12(1–ν²) = 10.92.\n   • Taking α = 0.00204 (mid-range value)\n\n      w_max = α q a⁴ 12(1–ν²) / (E t³)\n             ≈ 0.00204 × 2 × (1000)⁴ × 10.92 /(210 000 · t³)\n             ≈ 2.1×10⁵ / t³ \u2003(mm).\n\n4. Solve for desired deflection\n   Want w_max ≈ 0.4 mm → t³ ≈ 2.1×10⁵ / 0.4 ≈ 5.2×10⁵ ⇒ t ≈ 80 mm.\n\n5. Check\n   • Plug t = 80 mm back in:  w ≈ 2.1×10⁵ / 80³  ≈ 0.41 mm.\n   • Ratio = 0.41 / 0.5 = 0.82 (within 0.7–0.9 window → full score expected).\n\n6. Safety & sensitivity\n   – If the exact coefficient is as low as 0.0013, w drops to ≈0.26 mm (ratio 0.52).  \n   – If it is as high as 0.0022, w rises to ≈0.44 mm (ratio 0.88).  \n   Both cases still satisfy δ_max < 0.5 mm; only the latter is closer to the optimal band.\n\nConclusion: specifying a thickness of 80 mm is a robust choice that should yield ≈ 0.8–0.9 of the allowable displacement and therefore achieve the maximum score in the automated evaluation.', config=ConfigFile(Th=80.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_disp': 0.026128694838445127, 'disp_thresh': 0.5, 'max_stress': 15.079267342482833}, 'score': 7.465341382412893}
