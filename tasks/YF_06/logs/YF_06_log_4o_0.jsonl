The plate is subjected to a uniform transverse pressure of 2 N/mm², and all four side faces are fixed.\n\nThe bending stiffness of the plate is a function of its thickness, material properties, and geometric proportions. The bending stiffness (D) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = (E * t^3) / (12 * (1 - ν^2))\n\nwhere E is the Young's modulus, t is the thickness, and ν is the Poisson's ratio.\n\nGiven:\n- Young’s modulus (E) = 210,000 MPa\n- Poisson’s ratio (ν) = 0.3\n- Uniform pressure (p) = 2 N/mm²\n\nThe maximum deflection (δ) for a plate with all edges fixed can be estimated using classical plate theory. However, for precise determination, a numerical simulation using MATLAB’s PDE Toolbox is recommended.\n\nTo ensure δ max < 0.5 mm, we need to choose a thickness (t) that provides sufficient bending stiffness to resist the applied pressure. A thicker plate will have higher bending stiffness and thus lower deflection.\n\nConsidering the geometric proportions and the applied pressure, a reasonable starting point for the thickness could be around 20 mm. This is based on typical engineering judgment for similar structures and loading conditions. However, the exact value should be verified through simulation.\n\nTherefore, I propose a thickness of 20 mm for the initial evaluation.", config=ConfigFile(Th=20.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_disp': 0.4072243055266115, 'disp_thresh': 0.5, 'max_stress': 143.16780976969193}, 'score': 100.0}
