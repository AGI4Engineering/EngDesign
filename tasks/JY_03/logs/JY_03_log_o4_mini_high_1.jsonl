{'completion_tokens': 1727, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='We have a 100×100 polarization image with a “checkerboard” pattern of zeros at the 0° (Degree0) measurement positions. Our goal is to design a convolutional kernel that performs a bilinear‐style (linear in each axis) interpolation of missing (zeroed) pixels from their neighbors, while enforcing that the kernel’s center weight is exactly 1.\n\nStep 1: Identify the missing pixels. In the raw Degree0 frame, every other pixel (in a checkerboard arrangement) is zero. These zeros represent missing data to be interpolated from valid neighbors.\n\nStep 2: Choose a simple bilinear interpolation stencil. Bilinear interpolation in 2D can be approximated by weighting direct neighbors half as much as the center, and diagonal neighbors half again (i.e. one quarter of the center weight).  Concretely, if the center weight is W, then each of the four orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) gets weight W/2, and each of the four diagonal neighbors gets weight W/4.\n\nStep 3: Normalize the scale so the center is exactly 1.  Setting W = 1 yields the 3×3 kernel:\n    [[¼, ½, ¼],\n     [½, 1, ½],\n     [¼, ½, ¼]]\nEach missing pixel, when convolved with this kernel, gathers a weighted sum of its valid neighbors in direct proportion to their distances—exactly mimicking linear interpolation.\n\nThis 3×3 kernel is compact, has center = 1 as required, and naturally implements bilinear interpolation for checkerboard‐patterned missing data. It can be applied to Degree0 and will be scored by its effect on the recovered AoLP and DoLP images.', config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.25, 0.5, 0.25], [0.5, 1.0, 0.5], [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'degree_0': {'PSNR': np.float64(23.69400650701499), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.714446096593812), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}, 'DoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(74.13881600756719), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999104436825622), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}, 'AoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(76.86743477949068), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999381998661628), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}}, 'score': np.float64(88.44660432115312)}
