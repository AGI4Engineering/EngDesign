Let's analyze what we have:\n\n1. The Degree0 array shows a checkerboard pattern with zeros at alternate positions.\n2. I need to create a kernel for linear interpolation where the center value is 1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the Degree0 array:\n- It has a checkerboard pattern where every other pixel is 0\n- The zeros need to be filled by interpolating from neighboring values\n- The non-zero values should remain unchanged (which is why the center of the kernel must be 1)\n\nFor linear interpolation in a 2D grid with a checkerboard pattern, a 3×3 kernel would be appropriate. The center value must be 1 to preserve the original non-zero values, and the surrounding values should contribute to filling the zeros.\n\nSince we're dealing with a checkerboard pattern, the zeros are diagonally adjacent to non-zero values. The most effective kernel would place equal weight on the four diagonal neighbors (corner positions in a 3×3 kernel) while giving zero weight to the direct horizontal and vertical neighbors (which would also be zeros in a checkerboard pattern).\n\nA good kernel structure would be:\n\n[0.25, 0, 0.25]\n[0,    1,    0]\n[0.25, 0, 0.25]\n\nThis kernel:\n1. Preserves the original non-zero values (center weight of 1)\n2. Fills zeros by taking the average of the four diagonal neighbors (each with weight 0.25)\n3. Ignores the direct horizontal and vertical neighbors (weight 0)\n\nThis makes sense for a checkerboard pattern because:\n- When the kernel is centered on a non-zero value, it will keep that value (due to center weight of 1)\n- When the kernel is centered on a zero, it will compute a weighted average of the four diagonal neighbors, which in a checkerboard pattern would be the only non-zero adjacent values\n\nThis kernel will effectively perform linear interpolation for the checkerboard pattern in the Degree0 image while preserving the original non-zero values.", config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.25, 0.0, 0.25], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.25, 0.0, 0.25]])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'degree_0': {'PSNR': np.float64(7.625932315123575), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.15875983589059675), 'Score': [np.float64(17.470407188434308), np.float64(77.89960610591149), np.float64(121.63251944767403)]}, 'DoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(33.412665135845636), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.7226754937220888), 'Score': [np.float64(17.470407188434308), np.float64(77.89960610591149), np.float64(121.63251944767403)]}, 'AoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(57.5309816657067), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.994375847310813), 'Score': [np.float64(17.470407188434308), np.float64(77.89960610591149), np.float64(121.63251944767403)]}}, 'score': np.float64(59.299868701970496)}
