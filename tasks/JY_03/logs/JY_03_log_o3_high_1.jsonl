{'completion_tokens': 1751, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Problem recap\n   • The Degree0 frame of a 100×100 RAW-pol image shows a chessboard pattern where every second sample (the sensor locations that do NOT correspond to the 0° micro–polariser) is zero.\n   • We have to design a convolution kernel that, when centred on a pixel, performs a bilinear-style (linear) interpolation so that the missing (zero) samples are replaced by an estimate coming from their four nearest valid neighbours.\n\n2. Sensor layout consideration\n   In a typical Sony-type 2×2 micro-polariser array the 0° pixels sit on one checkerboard colour, while the other orientations (45°, 90°, 135°) sit on the remaining three positions. Therefore each lost sample has (at most) four directly adjacent valid 0° pixels: up, down, left, right.  A pure linear (bilinear) estimate for a missing location x̂ is\n\n        x̂ = ¼ (x_top + x_bottom + x_left + x_right)\n\n3. Convolution kernel derivation\n   Convolution replaces a pixel value p(x,y) with Σ K(i,j)·p(x+i,y+j).  To implement the rule above while keeping the original (already good) pixels untouched we put the weight 1 on the centre cell and distribute the interpolation weights on the cross-neighbours.  For a 3×3 mask this is\n\n        K3 = [[0   , 0.25, 0   ],\n              [0.25, 1   , 0.25],\n              [0   , 0.25, 0   ]]\n\n   ► However, to smooth slightly more and avoid striping artefacts near edges, a widely used refinement adds a tiny diagonal contribution.  The same idea can be written in a 5×5 footprint while still summing the side-weights to 1 (so that the kernel is energy-neutral for valid pixels):\n\n        K5 = [[0   , 0   , 0.125, 0   , 0   ],\n              [0   , 0.25, 0     , 0.25, 0   ],\n              [0.125, 0   , 1    , 0   , 0.125],\n              [0   , 0.25, 0     , 0.25, 0   ],\n              [0   , 0   , 0.125, 0   , 0   ]]\n\n   • The centre weight is exactly 1, satisfying the requirement that already correct pixels stay unchanged when the convolution is *masked* to act only on zeros.\n   • The cross neighbours carry 0.25 each (giving the pure bilinear average when the centre is zero).\n   • The very light 0.125 diagonal taps let the interpolation blend smoother without bias.\n\n4. Usage in processing chain\n   a) Run a mask M = (Degree0 == 0).\n   b) Convolve Degree0 with K5 (or K3).  Replace only the zero locations with the convolved result: Degree0_filled = Degree0;  Degree0_filled[M] = (Degree0 ⊗ K)[M].\n   c) Compute AoLP = ½·atan2(I_45 – I_135, I_0 – I_90)\n      and DoLP = sqrt((I_0 – I_90)² + (I_45 – I_135)²) / (I_0 + I_45 + I_90 + I_135)\n      using the repaired Degree0.  The smoother, bilinearly-consistent reconstruction reduces zipper artefacts in both metrics, boosting their PSNR/SSIM when compared against ground truth.\n\n5.
