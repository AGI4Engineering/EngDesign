The kernel should be able to estimate the missing values (zeros) based on the surrounding non-zero values. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The Degree0 array is a 100x100 matrix with a checkerboard pattern of zeros. This means every alternate value in each row and column is zero.\n   - We need to fill these zeros using a linear interpolation method.\n\n2. **Designing the Kernel:**\n   - A kernel is a small matrix used to apply a filter to an image. In this case, the kernel will be used to interpolate missing values.\n   - The kernel should have a center value of 1, which means the current pixel value is retained if it's non-zero.\n   - The surrounding values in the kernel should be designed to average the neighboring non-zero values to fill in the zero values.\n\n3. **Kernel Structure:**\n   - A simple 3x3 kernel can be used for linear interpolation. The kernel will look like this:\n     ```\n     [[0.25, 0.5, 0.25],\n      [0.5,  1,  0.5],\n      [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]]\n     ```\n   - This kernel gives more weight to the immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors (0.5) and less weight to the diagonal neighbors (0.25).\n   - The center of the kernel is 1, which means if the current pixel is non-zero, it retains its value.\n\n4. **Application of the Kernel:**\n   - The kernel is applied to each zero value in the Degree0 array. The zero value is replaced by the weighted sum of its neighbors as defined by the kernel.\n\n5. **Testing with AoLP and DoLP:**\n   - After filling the Degree0 array, the AoLP and DoLP images can be computed.\n   - These images will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the kernel. A good kernel should result in AoLP and DoLP images that are consistent with the expected polarization characteristics.\n\nBy following these steps, we can effectively fill in the missing values in the Degree0 array and evaluate the kernel's performance using AoLP and DoLP images.", config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.25, 0.5, 0.25], [0.5, 1.0, 0.5], [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'degree_0': {'PSNR': np.float64(23.69400650701499), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.714446096593812), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}, 'DoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(74.13881600756719), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999104436825622), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}, 'AoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(76.86743477949068), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999381998661628), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}}, 'score': np.float64(88.44660432115312)}
