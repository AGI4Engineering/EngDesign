In this rubric three values are being tested.

The interpolated Degree0 image 
The AoLP
The DoLP 

Two different metrics were used, SSIM and PSNR. 
For each component Score = PSNR/40 *50 + SSIM*50 
If the Score of each component is higher than threshold, the respective points will be accumulated 
If the score is less than 50 for any section, the passed will be false. 
In the end the final score will be averaged as there are three values that are tested.
