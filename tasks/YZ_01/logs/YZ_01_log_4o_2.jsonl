{'completion_tokens': 554, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='### Task 1: Top Level Parameters\n\n1. **Fpass (Passband Cutoff Frequency):**\n   - The maximum possible LTE bandwidth is 10 MHz. To accommodate this, the passband cutoff frequency should be slightly higher than 10 MHz to ensure that the entire bandwidth is within the passband. A typical choice might be 10.5 MHz to provide a small margin.\n\n2. **Fstop (Stopband Frequency):**\n   - The Nyquist rate for the output sample rate (FsLTERx = 30.72 MHz) is 15.36 MHz. However, to ensure more out-of-band signal rejection, Fstop can be set slightly lower than the Nyquist rate. A reasonable choice might be 14 MHz.\n\n3. **Ast (Stopband Attenuation):**\n   - LTE systems typically require high stopband attenuation to prevent interference. A common choice for stopband attenuation is 60 dB.\n\n4. **Ap (Passband Ripple):**\n   - The passband ripple should be minimal to maintain signal integrity. A typical value for passband ripple in communication systems is 0.1 dB.\n\n### Task 2: Reduction Factors\n\n1. **Factor_1 and Factor_2:**\n   - The total reduction factor needed is the ratio of the input rate to the output rate, which is 150 MHz / 30.72 MHz â‰ˆ 4.8828.\n   - The Farrow rate converter should handle the non-integer part of the reduction, and the two FIR filters should handle the integer part.\n   - A reasonable choice is to have Factor_1 = 2 and Factor_2 = 2, which gives a total integer reduction of 4. The Farrow rate converter will then handle the remaining factor of 1.2207 (approximately).\n\n2. **EVM Requirements:**\n   - The choice of factors should ensure that the EVM requirements are met. The condition `Factor_2 * FsLTERx - 2 * Fpass > 0 MHz` ensures that the second FIR filter does not introduce aliasing. With Factor_2 = 2, this condition becomes `2 * 30.72 MHz - 2 * 10.5 MHz = 40.44 MHz > 0 MHz`, which is satisfied.\n\nBased on these considerations, the parameters are set as follows:', config=Config(Fpass=10.5, Fstop=14.0, Ast=60.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=2.0, Factor_2=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Fpass': 10500000.0, 'Fstop': 14000000.0, 'Ast': 60.0, 'Ap': 0.1, 'Factor_1': 2.0, 'Factor_2': 2.0, 'fpsrEVM': 0.05106854902188105, 'fpspEVM': 0.10280708677831718}, 'score': 45.0}
