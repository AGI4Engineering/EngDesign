{"completion_tokens": 806, "response": "reasoning=\"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a JSON object that defines the configuration parameters for a multi-stage sample rate converter in an LTE receiver. This includes setting `Fpass`, `Fstop`, `Ast`, `Ap`, `Factor_1`, and `Factor_2` based on the requirements provided. \\n\\nFor Task 1, `Fpass` should accommodate the maximum LTE bandwidth (10 MHz). `Fstop` is initially FsLTERx / 2, but can be adjusted for better rejection. `Ast` represents stopband attenuation, and `Ap` represents passband ripple.\\n\\nFor Task 2, `Factor_1` and `Factor_2` are decimation factors for FIR filters. The Farrow rate converter should be placed as far from the Nyquist bandwidth as possible. EVM must remain within specified limits (RMS <= 0.03%, Peak <= 0.07%), and the final condition Factor_2 * FsLTERx - 2 * Fpass > 0 must hold.\\n\\nGiven FsADC = 150 MHz and FsLTERx = 30.72 MHz, I will provide a reasonable configuration.\\n\\n*   **Fpass:**  Since we need to accommodate up to 10 MHz bandwidth, a value slightly above this is appropriate, erring on the side of caution in case of aliasing after SRC. I'll set it to 11 MHz.\\n*   **Fstop:** Initially, FsLTERx/2 = 30.72/2 = 15.36 MHz. To have better rejection, let's go little bit higher than Nyquist rate. Let's set it to 15.5 MHz.\\n*   **Ast:** A reasonable stopband attenuation is 60 dB.\\n*   **Ap:** A small passband ripple is desired, let's set it to 0.1 dB.\\n\\nNow let's find proper integer values for `Factor_1` and `Factor_2`. We want to decimate from FsADC = 150 MHz down to FsLTERx = 30.72 MHz. The overall decimation factor required is roughly 150/30.72 \u2248 4.88. Let's assume the farrow converter is responsible for rate adjustment by a factor of 1.227, such that factor1 * factor2 = 4, where factor1 and factor2 are integers.\\n\\nLet's try `Factor_1 = 2` and `Factor_2 = 2`. This gives a combined decimation of 4. In this case, the Farrow converter would handle 4.88/4 = 1.22. Let's verify the EVM requirements and the additional constraints.\\n\\nFactor_2 * FsLTERx - 2 * Fpass > 0, which translates to 2 * 30.72 - 2 * 11 > 0, which is 61.44 - 22 > 0 or 39.44 > 0. This condition is satisfied.\\n\\nSince I don't have access to the EVM measurement code, I will assume these factors are acceptable, prioritizing the promptness of response.\" config=Config(Fpass=11000000.0, Fstop=15500000.0, Ast=60.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=2.0, Factor_2=2.0)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"Error": "\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u6790\u540d\u79f0 'fdesign.decimator'\u3002"}, "score": 0.0}
