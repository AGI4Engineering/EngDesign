{"completion_tokens": 278, "response": "reasoning='Task 1 involves determining the top-level parameters. Given the problem description, we can determine the following: Fpass should be slightly larger than the maximum LTE bandwidth of 10MHz. Fstop is based on the Nyquist rate of the output which is FsLTERx / 2 = 30.72 / 2 = 15.36 MHz. Since, we require further out-of-band rejection, let us consider it to be equal to 15.36 MHz. Ap and Ast are estimated, and are expected to be in the ranges 0.001~1dB and 60~80dB respectively. Task 2 involves determining Factor_1 and Factor_2. The prompt also specifies that Factor_1 and Factor_2 should both be integers greater than 1 and also specify the lower bound constraints on floating point SRC RMS EVM and floating point SRC Peak EVM' config=Config(Fpass=10.5, Fstop=15.36, Ast=70.0, Ap=0.01, Factor_1=2.0, Factor_2=3.0)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"Error": "\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u6790\u540d\u79f0 'fdesign.decimator'\u3002"}, "score": 0.0}
