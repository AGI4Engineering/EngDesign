The configuration needs to specify the passband frequency (Fpass), stopband frequency (Fstop), stopband attenuation (Ast), passband ripple (Ap), and the decimation factors for the last two stages (Factor_1 and Factor_2). Based on the description, Task 1 requires setting Fpass and Fstop, and Task 2 requires setting Factor_1 and Factor_2 based on some error vector magnitude(EVM) constraints. Following are the configurations according to the given description.' config=Config(Fpass=10000000.0, Fstop=15360000.0, Ast=60.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=2.0, Factor_2=5.0)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"Error": "\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u6790\u540d\u79f0 'fdesign.decimator'\u3002"}, "score": 0.0}
