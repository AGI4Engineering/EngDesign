Let's choose Fpass = 12 MHz.\n\n2. **Fstop (Stopband frequency)**:\n   - Typically this is the Nyquist rate, which is FsLTERx/2 = 30.72/2 = 15.36 MHz.\n   - However, we might want to provide a bit more margin for better out-of-band rejection.\n   - Let's set Fstop = 15 MHz, which is slightly below the Nyquist rate but provides good transition band width.\n\n3. **Ast (Stopband attenuation)**:\n   - For LTE receivers, we typically want high stopband attenuation to reduce interference.\n   - A standard value would be around 80 dB, which provides excellent rejection of unwanted signals.\n\n4. **Ap (Passband ripple)**:\n   - To maintain signal integrity, we want minimal passband ripple.\n   - A standard value would be 0.1 dB, which ensures minimal distortion of the desired signal.\n\n### Task 2: Determining Reduction Factors\n\nWe need to determine the reduction factors for the two decimating FIR filters while ensuring the Farrow rate converter is placed optimally.\n\nInput rate = 150 MHz\nOutput rate = 30.72 MHz\nTotal reduction factor = 150/30.72 ≈ 4.883\n\nWe need to split this into three stages:\n1. Farrow rate converter (fine adjustment)\n2. First decimating FIR filter (Factor_1)\n3. Second decimating FIR filter (Factor_2)\n\nThe Farrow converter should handle the non-integer part of the conversion ratio. Let's determine optimal integer factors for the FIR stages:\n\nPossible combinations for Factor_1 and Factor_2 (both must be integers > 1):\n- 2 × 2 = 4 (total reduction of 4, requires Farrow to do 4.883/4 ≈ 1.221)\n- 3 × 2 = 6 (total reduction of 6, requires Farrow to do 4.883/6 ≈ 0.814)\n- 2 × 3 = 6 (same as above but with factors reversed)\n- 4 × 1 = 4 (not valid as Factor_2 must be > 1)\n- 1 × 4 = 4 (not valid as Factor_1 must be > 1)\n\nLet's check the constraint: Factor_2 * FsLTERx - 2 * Fpass > 0 MHz\n\nFor Factor_2 = 2:\n2 * 30.72 - 2 * 12 = 61.44 - 24 = 37.44 MHz > 0 ✓\n\nFor Factor_2 = 3:\n3 * 30.72 - 2 * 12 = 92.16 - 24 = 68.16 MHz > 0 ✓\n\nSince both options satisfy the constraint, we need to consider which one would place the Farrow converter farther from the Nyquist bandwidth.\n\nWith Factor_1 = 2 and Factor_2 = 2, the Farrow converter has to adjust by a factor of approximately 1.221, which is more challenging than a factor closer to 1.\n\nWith Factor_1 = 2 and Factor_2 = 3, or Factor_1 = 3 and Factor_2 = 2, the total reduction is 6, requiring the Farrow converter to adjust by a factor of 0.814, which is further from 1.\n\nSince we want to place the Farrow converter as far from the Nyquist bandwidth as possible, and we want to ensure good EVM performance, I'll choose Factor_1 = 2 and Factor_2 = 2.\n\nThis configuration should satisfy the EVM requirements of:\n- floating point SRC RMS EVM: <= 0.03%\n- floating point SRC Peak EVM: <= 0.07%\n\nThe Farrow converter will handle the fine adjustment by a factor of approximately 1.221, while the two decimating FIR filters will each reduce the rate by a factor of 2.", config=Config(Fpass=12.0, Fstop=15.0, Ast=80.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=2.0, Factor_2=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Fpass': 12000000.0, 'Fstop': 15000000.0, 'Ast': 80.0, 'Ap': 0.1, 'Factor_1': 2.0, 'Factor_2': 2.0, 'fpsrEVM': 0.10523767654741072, 'fpspEVM': 0.16744227141577372}, 'score': 30.0}
