Fpass is set to 10 MHz to accommodate the maximum LTE bandwidth. Fstop is set to 15.36 MHz, which is the Nyquist rate of the output sample rate. Ast is set to 80 dB for good stopband attenuation, and Ap is set to 0.1 dB for minimal passband ripple. For the reduction factors, I calculated the overall sample rate reduction ratio as 4.883. To place the Farrow rate converter far from the Nyquist bandwidth, I chose Factor_1 = 2 and Factor_2 = 3, which makes the Farrow_factor = 0.814. This configuration maintains high intermediate sample rates (184.28 MHz after Farrow, 92.14 MHz after first FIR) and provides a large margin (72.16 MHz) for the specified constraint, which helps minimize aliasing effects and should meet the EVM requirements.', config=Config(Fpass=10.0, Fstop=15.36, Ast=80.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=2.0, Factor_2=3.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Fpass': 10000000.0, 'Fstop': 15360000.0, 'Ast': 80.0, 'Ap': 0.1, 'Factor_1': 2.0, 'Factor_2': 3.0, 'fpsrEVM': 0.0408229723976117, 'fpspEVM': 0.09251749193977478}, 'score': 45.0}
