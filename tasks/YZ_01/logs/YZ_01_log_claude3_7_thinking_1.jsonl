I'll add some margin to account for transition bands, setting Fpass to approximately 15% higher than the maximum bandwidth:\nFpass = 10 MHz × 1.15 = 11.5 MHz\n\n**Fstop (Stopband frequency):**\nThis is typically the Nyquist rate of the output sample rate:\nFstop = FsLTERx/2 = 30.72 MHz/2 = 15.36 MHz\n\n**Ast (Stopband attenuation):**\nFor LTE receivers, a high stopband attenuation is needed to ensure good signal quality. A typical value is 70 dB.\n\n**Ap (Passband ripple):**\nTo maintain signal integrity, a small passband ripple is desirable. A typical value for high-quality communication systems is 0.1 dB.\n\n### Task 2: Determining the Reduction Factors\n\nThe overall conversion ratio is:\nFsADC/FsLTERx = 150/30.72 ≈ 4.8828125\n\nThis will be achieved through three stages:\n1. Farrow rate converter (fine adjustment)\n2. First decimating FIR filter with Factor_1\n3. Second decimating FIR filter with Factor_2\n\nWe need to find integers Factor_1 and Factor_2 such that:\nR_farrow × Factor_1 × Factor_2 = 4.8828125\n\nAnd the Farrow converter should be placed as far from the Nyquist bandwidth as possible, meaning R_farrow should be as close to 1 as possible.\n\nLet's consider two options:\n\nOption 1:\nFactor_1 = 2, Factor_2 = 2\nR_farrow = 4.8828125/(2×2) = 1.220703125\n|1 - R_farrow| = 0.220703125\n\nOption 2:\nFactor_1 = 3, Factor_2 = 2\nR_farrow = 4.8828125/(3×2) = 0.81380208\n|1 - R_farrow| = 0.18619792\n\nOption 2 has R_farrow closer to 1, so it places the Farrow converter further from the Nyquist bandwidth.\n\nLet's verify the constraint: Factor_2 × FsLTERx - 2 × Fpass > 0 MHz\nWith Factor_2 = 2:\n2 × 30.72 MHz - 2 × 11.5 MHz = 61.44 MHz - 23 MHz = 38.44 MHz > 0 MHz\n\nThe constraint is satisfied. Since Option 2 has R_farrow closer to 1 and satisfies all constraints, I'll select Factor_1 = 3 and Factor_2 = 2.", config=Config(Fpass=11.5, Fstop=15.36, Ast=70.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=3.0, Factor_2=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Fpass': 11500000.0, 'Fstop': 15360000.0, 'Ast': 70.0, 'Ap': 0.1, 'Factor_1': 3.0, 'Factor_2': 2.0, 'fpsrEVM': 0.05933857159640943, 'fpspEVM': 0.12685034939882806}, 'score': 30.0}
