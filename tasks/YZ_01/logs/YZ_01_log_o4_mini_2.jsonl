{'completion_tokens': 2351, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='We need to convert FsADC=150 MHz to FsLTERx=30.72 MHz through a three-stage chain: 1) a Farrow fractional resampler at the full 150 MHz rate, then 2) two integer-decimation FIR filters. The LTE signal occupies a 10 MHz complex baseband (±5 MHz), so the passband cutoff Fpass must be at least 5 MHz. The final sample rate FsLTERx/2=15.36 MHz is the Nyquist limit and thus a suitable Fstop. Typical LTE receiver FIRs use a stopband attenuation of 60 dB and a passband ripple of ≤0.1 dB to meet EVM specs. The total conversion ratio is 150/30.72≈4.8828. We choose the Farrow to convert 150 MHz →122.88 MHz (ratio 0.8192), since 122.88/30.72=4 exactly. We then split the remaining integer decimation 4 into two factors >1: Factor_1=2 and Factor_2=2. This places the Farrow first (at the widest bandwidth) and pushes the heavy integer decimation later (at lower bandwidth). We verify: 150·0.8192=122.88; 122.88/2/2=30.72. The EVM budgets (RMS ≤0.03%, peak ≤0.07%) are comfortably met with Ap=0.1 dB, Ast=60 dB. Finally, Factor_2·FsLTERx–2·Fpass =2·30.72–2·5 =51.44 MHz >0, satisfying the transition-band requirement.', config=Config(Fpass=5000000.0, Fstop=15360000.0, Ast=60.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=2.0, Factor_2=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Error': 'Expected TransitionWidth to be positive.'}, 'score': 0.0}
