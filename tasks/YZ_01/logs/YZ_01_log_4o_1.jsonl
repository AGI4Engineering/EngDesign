{'completion_tokens': 535, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a multi-stage sample rate converter for an LTE receiver, we need to follow a structured approach to ensure that the converter meets the specified requirements. Let's break down the tasks:\n\n### Task 1: Top Level Parameters\n1. **Input and Output Rates**: We have an input sample rate (FsADC) of 150 MHz and an output rate (FsLTERx) of 30.72 MHz.\n2. **Passband Frequency (Fpass)**: The passband cutoff frequency should accommodate the maximum possible LTE bandwidth of 10 MHz. Therefore, Fpass should be slightly above 10 MHz to ensure the entire LTE signal is within the passband.\n3. **Stopband Frequency (Fstop)**: Typically set to the Nyquist rate, which is half of the output rate, FsLTERx/2 = 30.72 MHz / 2 = 15.36 MHz. This can be adjusted if more out-of-band rejection is needed.\n4. **Stopband Attenuation (Ast)**: A typical value for stopband attenuation in communication systems is around 60 dB to ensure sufficient rejection of out-of-band signals.\n5. **Passband Ripple (Ap)**: A small passband ripple is desired, typically around 0.1 dB, to maintain signal integrity within the passband.\n\n### Task 2: Reduction Factors\n1. **Farrow Rate Converter**: This should be placed as far from the Nyquist bandwidth as possible to minimize distortion.\n2. **Reduction Factors (Factor_1 and Factor_2)**: These are integers greater than one. The product of these factors should equal the overall decimation ratio, which is the ratio of the input rate to the output rate (150 MHz / 30.72 MHz â‰ˆ 4.8828125). Since these are integers, we need to find two factors whose product is close to this ratio.\n3. **EVM Requirements**: Ensure that the floating point SRC RMS EVM is <= 0.03% and the Peak EVM is <= 0.07%.\n4. **Condition**: Factor_2 * FsLTERx - 2 * Fpass > 0 MHz. This ensures that the second decimation stage does not introduce aliasing.\n\nLet's calculate the parameters for Task 1 and Task 2.", config=Config(Fpass=10.5, Fstop=15.36, Ast=60.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=4.0, Factor_2=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Fpass': 10500000.0, 'Fstop': 15360000.0, 'Ast': 60.0, 'Ap': 0.1, 'Factor_1': 4.0, 'Factor_2': 5.0, 'fpsrEVM': 0.04181482135038224, 'fpspEVM': 0.12877792803838975}, 'score': 45.0}
