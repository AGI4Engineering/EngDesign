{'completion_tokens': 2223, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='We need to go from an ADC rate of 150 MHz down to the LTE baseband rate of 30.72 MHz, using a Farrow fine‐rate converter followed by two integer‐decimation FIR stages.  \n\n1)  Choose Fpass to cover the full 10 MHz LTE channel: at baseband this is ±5 MHz, so set Fpass = 5e6 Hz.  \n2)  The natural stop‐band edge at Nyquist for 30.72 MHz is half that: 15.36 MHz.  We choose Fstop = 15.36e6 Hz to fully suppress images.  \n3)  LTE waveforms typically require large out‐of‐band rejection, so pick a stop‐band attenuation of Ast = 80 dB and a pass‐band ripple Ap = 0.01 dB.  \n4)  The total decimation from 150 MHz to 30.72 MHz is 150/30.72 ≈ 4.8828, a non‐integer, thus handled by the Farrow block first.  We then split the remaining integer decimation into two 2× stages (Factor_1 = 2, Factor_2 = 2).  \n   - This makes the total integer decimation 2×2=4.  The Farrow converter must therefore apply a fine rate factor of (30.72×4)/150≈0.8192.  \n   - The condition Factor_2×FsLTERx – 2·Fpass = 2×30.72 MHz – 2×5 MHz = 61.44 MHz – 10 MHz = 51.44 MHz > 0 is satisfied.  \n5)  With these choices, a MATLAB EVM check should show the floating‐point SRC RMS EVM ≤ 0.03% and peak EVM ≤ 0.07%, meeting LTE requirements.', config=Config(Fpass=5000000.0, Fstop=15360000.0, Ast=80.0, Ap=0.01, Factor_1=2.0, Factor_2=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Error': 'Expected TransitionWidth to be positive.'}, 'score': 0.0}
