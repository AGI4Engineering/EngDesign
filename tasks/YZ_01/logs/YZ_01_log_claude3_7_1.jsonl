{'completion_tokens': 1070, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a multi-stage sample rate converter for an LTE receiver, I need to determine appropriate parameters for each stage while meeting the given requirements.\n\n### Task 1: Specifying top-level parameters\n\nGiven:\n- Input rate (FsADC) = 150 MHz\n- Output rate (FsLTERx) = 30.72 MHz\n\nI need to determine:\n1. Fpass: This should accommodate the maximum LTE bandwidth of 10 MHz\n2. Fstop: Typically Nyquist rate (FsLTERx/2)\n3. Ast: Stopband attenuation in dB\n4. Ap: Passband ripple in dB\n\nLet's determine these parameters:\n\n1. **Fpass**:\n   For a 10 MHz LTE bandwidth, we typically need Fpass to be at least half of the bandwidth, so 5 MHz. However, to ensure full coverage of the bandwidth, I'll set Fpass to be slightly higher than half the maximum bandwidth: Fpass = 5.5 MHz.\n\n2. **Fstop**:\n   Typically set to FsLTERx/2 = 30.72/2 = 15.36 MHz. This is the Nyquist frequency for the output sample rate.\n\n3. **Ast**:\n   For LTE receivers, a high stopband attenuation is necessary to prevent aliasing. A typical value is Ast = 80 dB.\n\n4. **Ap**:\n   For LTE signal quality, we need low passband ripple. A typical value is Ap = 0.1 dB.\n\n### Task 2: Determining reduction factors\n\nI need to determine Factor_1 and Factor_2 for the decimating FIR filters.\n\nThe total reduction factor from FsADC to FsLTERx is:\nFsADC/FsLTERx = 150/30.72 ≈ 4.8828125\n\nThis total reduction is achieved through three stages:\n1. Farrow rate converter (fine adjustment)\n2. Decimating FIR filter with Factor_1\n3. Decimating FIR filter with Factor_2\n\nLet's choose integer values for Factor_1 and Factor_2 that multiply to give a value close to the total reduction factor:\n\nFor Factor_1 = 2 and Factor_2 = 2, we get Factor_1 × Factor_2 = 4\nThis means the Farrow converter needs to handle the remaining factor: 4.8828125/4 ≈ 1.220703125\n\nLet's check if this satisfies the third requirement:\nFactor_2 × FsLTERx - 2 × Fpass = 2 × 30.72 - 2 × 5.5 = 61.44 - 11 = 50.44 MHz > 0\n\nThis is significantly greater than 0, which is good for filter design but might not be optimal for placing the Farrow converter far from the Nyquist bandwidth.\n\nLet's try Factor_1 = 3 and Factor_2 = 2, giving Factor_1 × Factor_2 = 6\nThis means the Farrow converter handles: 4.8828125/6 ≈ 0.8138 (rate expansion by a factor of 1/0.8138 ≈ 1.229)\n\nChecking the requirement:\nFactor_2 × FsLTERx - 2 × Fpass = 2 × 30.72 - 2 × 5.5 = 50.44 MHz > 0\n\nStill satisfied, but the Farrow converter now performs rate expansion rather than reduction.\n\nLet's go with Factor_1 = 2 and Factor_2 = 2, as this gives a reasonable balance and keeps all stages as rate reduction rather than expansion.", config=Config(Fpass=5.5, Fstop=15.36, Ast=80.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=2.0, Factor_2=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Fpass': 5500000.0, 'Fstop': 15360000.0, 'Ast': 80.0, 'Ap': 0.1, 'Factor_1': 2.0, 'Factor_2': 2.0, 'fpsrEVM': 0.11237665710175992, 'fpspEVM': 0.2172815548745664}, 'score': 45.0}
