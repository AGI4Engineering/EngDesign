Farrow rate converter (Factor_0)\n2. First decimating FIR filter (Factor_1)\n3. Second decimating FIR filter (Factor_2)\n\nWhere Factor_0 × Factor_1 × Factor_2 = 4.8828\n\nSince Factor_1 and Factor_2 must be integers greater than 1, I'll evaluate possible combinations:\n\nOption 1: Factor_1 = 2, Factor_2 = 2\nFactor_0 = 4.8828/(2×2) = 1.2207\n\nOption 2: Factor_1 = 2, Factor_2 = 3\nFactor_0 = 4.8828/(2×3) = 0.8138\n\nOption 3: Factor_1 = 3, Factor_2 = 2\nFactor_0 = 4.8828/(3×2) = 0.8138\n\nI need to verify if these options satisfy the constraint:\nFactor_2 × FsLTERx - 2 × Fpass > 0 MHz\n\nFor Option 1: 2 × 30.72 MHz - 2 × 5 MHz = 61.44 MHz - 10 MHz = 51.44 MHz > 0 MHz ✓\nFor Option 2: 3 × 30.72 MHz - 2 × 5 MHz = 92.16 MHz - 10 MHz = 82.16 MHz > 0 MHz ✓\nFor Option 3: 2 × 30.72 MHz - 2 × 5 MHz = 61.44 MHz - 10 MHz = 51.44 MHz > 0 MHz ✓\n\nAll options satisfy the constraint. Option 1 (Factor_1 = 2, Factor_2 = 2) provides a balanced decimation between the two FIR filters and keeps the Farrow converter adjustment reasonably close to 1, which is generally preferred for efficient implementation. With this choice, the sample rates at each stage would be:\n- After Farrow: 150 MHz/1.2207 = 122.88 MHz\n- After FIR1: 122.88 MHz/2 = 61.44 MHz\n- After FIR2: 61.44 MHz/2 = 30.72 MHz (matching our target)\n\nTherefore, I'll select Factor_1 = 2 and Factor_2 = 2.", config=Config(Fpass=5.0, Fstop=15.36, Ast=60.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=2.0, Factor_2=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Fpass': 5000000.0, 'Fstop': 15360000.0, 'Ast': 60.0, 'Ap': 0.1, 'Factor_1': 2.0, 'Factor_2': 2.0, 'fpsrEVM': 0.08827673753557587, 'fpspEVM': 0.1667268990895683}, 'score': 60.0}
