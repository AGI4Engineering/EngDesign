{'completion_tokens': 517, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design a multi-stage sample rate converter for an LTE receiver, we need to follow a structured approach to ensure that the converter meets the LTE signal integrity constraints. The task involves two main parts: specifying the top-level parameters and determining the reduction factors for the decimating FIR filters.\n\n### Task 1: Specify Top-Level Parameters\n1. **Input and Output Rates**: The input sample rate (FsADC) is 150 MHz, and the output sample rate (FsLTERx) is 30.72 MHz.\n2. **Passband Frequency (Fpass)**: The passband cutoff frequency should accommodate the maximum possible LTE bandwidth of 10 MHz. Therefore, Fpass should be slightly above 10 MHz to ensure the entire LTE signal is within the passband.\n3. **Stopband Frequency (Fstop)**: Typically set to the Nyquist rate, which is half of the output sample rate (FsLTERx/2 = 15.36 MHz). This can be adjusted if more out-of-band signal rejection is required.\n4. **Stopband Attenuation (Ast)**: A typical value for stopband attenuation in dB is around 60 dB to ensure sufficient rejection of out-of-band signals.\n5. **Passband Ripple (Ap)**: A small passband ripple, such as 0.1 dB, is desired to maintain signal integrity within the passband.\n\n### Task 2: Determine Reduction Factors\n1. **Farrow Rate Converter**: This should be placed as far from the Nyquist bandwidth as possible to minimize distortion.\n2. **Reduction Factors (Factor_1 and Factor_2)**: These are integers greater than one. The product of these factors should equal the overall decimation ratio required to go from 150 MHz to 30.72 MHz.\n3. **EVM Requirements**: Ensure that the floating point SRC RMS EVM is <= 0.03% and the floating point SRC Peak EVM is <= 0.07%.\n4. **Condition**: Factor_2 * FsLTERx - 2 * Fpass > 0 MHz to ensure proper filter design.\n\nBy following these steps, we can design a multi-stage sample rate converter that meets the LTE requirements.', config=Config(Fpass=10.5, Fstop=15.36, Ast=60.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=5.0, Factor_2=1.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Error': 'Expected TransitionWidth to be positive.'}, 'score': 0.0}
