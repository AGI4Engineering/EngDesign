{'completion_tokens': 3699, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design the multi-stage sample rate converter, we start by determining the top-level parameters. The passband frequency Fpass is set to 10 MHz to accommodate the maximum LTE bandwidth. Fstop is set to the Nyquist rate of the output (30.72 MHz / 2 = 15.36 MHz). Ast and Ap are chosen as 80 dB and 0.1 dB, respectively, to meet stringent LTE signal integrity requirements. For the decimation factors, the Farrow converter first adjusts the rate by a factor of ~1.2288 (150 MHz → 184.32 MHz). The subsequent FIR stages decimate by integers 3 and 2, satisfying Factor_2 * FsLTERx - 2 * Fpass = 61.44 MHz - 20 MHz = 41.44 MHz > 0. This configuration ensures compliance with EVM limits.', config=Config(Fpass=10000000.0, Fstop=15360000.0, Ast=80.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=3.0, Factor_2=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Error': "无法解析名称 'fdesign.decimator'。"}, 'score': 0.0}
