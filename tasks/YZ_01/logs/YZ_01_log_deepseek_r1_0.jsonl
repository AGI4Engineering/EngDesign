Fstop is the Nyquist rate of the output (30.72 MHz / 2 = 15.36 MHz). Ast (stopband attenuation) is chosen as 60 dB to ensure sufficient out-of-band rejection. Ap (passband ripple) is set to 0.1 dB for minimal signal distortion.\n\nTask 2: The total decimation ratio is 150/30.72 ≈ 4.8828. To achieve integer factors, the Farrow converter adjusts the rate to allow subsequent decimation by 2 and 2. This satisfies Factor_2 * FsLTERx - 2 * Fpass = 2 * 30.72 - 20 = 41.44 MHz > 0. These factors also meet EVM requirements by keeping the decimation stages efficient and avoiding aliasing.', config=Config(Fpass=10000000.0, Fstop=15360000.0, Ast=60.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=2.0, Factor_2=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Error': "无法解析名称 'fdesign.decimator'。"}, 'score': 0.0}
