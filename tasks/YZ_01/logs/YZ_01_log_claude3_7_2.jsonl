{'completion_tokens': 1159, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="Let's tackle this step by step.\n\n### Task 1: Specifying Top Level Parameters\n\nGiven information:\n- Input sample rate (FsADC) = 150 MHz\n- Output sample rate (FsLTERx) = 30.72 MHz\n\nFirst, I need to determine Fpass:\n- LTE maximum bandwidth is 10 MHz\n- To accommodate this bandwidth, the passband cutoff frequency (Fpass) should be at least 10 MHz or slightly higher to ensure the full signal bandwidth is preserved\n- A common practice is to add some margin, so I'll set Fpass = 10.5 MHz\n\nFor Fstop, typically it's the Nyquist rate of the output sample rate:\n- Fstop = FsLTERx/2 = 30.72 MHz/2 = 15.36 MHz\n\nFor Ast (stopband attenuation):\n- Typical values for wireless communication systems range from 60-100 dB\n- LTE systems typically require good rejection of adjacent channels\n- I'll set Ast = 80 dB, which provides strong out-of-band rejection\n\nFor Ap (passband ripple):\n- This affects the in-band signal fidelity\n- For LTE receivers, this should be kept small\n- I'll set Ap = 0.1 dB, which is a common value for communications systems\n\n### Task 2: Determining Reduction Factors\n\nThe overall sample rate conversion ratio is:\nFsADC/FsLTERx = 150 MHz/30.72 MHz = 4.8828125\n\nThis needs to be split across three stages:\n1. Farrow rate converter (fine adjustment)\n2. First decimating FIR filter with reduction Factor_1\n3. Second decimating FIR filter with reduction Factor_2\n\nLet's determine good integer values for Factor_1 and Factor_2:\n\nWe want to place the Farrow rate converter as far from the Nyquist bandwidth as possible. This suggests we should do the largest integer decimation first to relax the requirements on the Farrow stage.\n\nLooking at the overall ratio 4.8828125, I can factorize it into:\n4.8828125 = 5 × 0.976562\n\nSo I can use a structure where:\n- Factor_1 = 5 (first decimation)\n- Farrow converter handles the remaining 0.976562 ratio\n- Factor_2 = 1 (no further integer decimation needed)\n\nBut the requirement states Factor_2 must be greater than 1. Let's try another factorization:\n\n4.8828125 = 3 × 1.6276\n\nOr even better:\n4.8828125 = 3 × 1.627604 = 3 × (3/2) × 1.08507 = 4.5 × 1.08507\n\nSo I could use:\n- Factor_1 = 3\n- Factor_2 = 3/2 = 1.5\n\nBut Factor_2 needs to be an integer. Let's try:\n\n4.8828125 = 2 × 2.44140625 = 2 × 2 × 1.220703125 = 4 × 1.220703125\n\nSo I'll use:\n- Factor_1 = 2\n- Factor_2 = 2\n- Farrow converter handles the remaining 1.220703125\n\nLet's check if this meets the third requirement:\nFactor_2 * FsLTERx - 2 * Fpass > 0\n2 * 30.72 MHz - 2 * 10.5 MHz = 61.44 MHz - 21 MHz = 40.44 MHz > 0\n\nThis meets the requirement with a good margin. These factors should ensure the Farrow converter operates well away from the Nyquist frequency, which should help maintain the EVM within the required limits (RMS EVM ≤ 0.03%, Peak EVM ≤ 0.07%).", config=Config(Fpass=10.5, Fstop=15.36, Ast=80.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=2.0, Factor_2=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Fpass': 10500000.0, 'Fstop': 15360000.0, 'Ast': 80.0, 'Ap': 0.1, 'Factor_1': 2.0, 'Factor_2': 2.0, 'fpsrEVM': 0.05456850510641279, 'fpspEVM': 0.09102200041584058}, 'score': 30.0}
