Top-level specs (Task 1):  \n   - The maximum LTE channel bandwidth is 10 MHz, so our passband cutoff must at least accommodate ±5 MHz around DC.  Setting Fpass = 10 MHz gives a clean margin.  \n   - The Nyquist rate at 30.72 MHz is FsLTERx/2 = 15.36 MHz; we choose Fstop = 15.36 MHz to fully reject out-of-band.  \n   - To keep passband ripple negligible on the EVM, we target Ap = 0.1 dB.  \n   - For sufficient spurious-free dynamic range we set stopband attenuation Ast = 60 dB.  \n\n2. Decimation factors (Task 2):  \n   - The overall rate change is 30.72/150 = 0.2048.  We place the Farrow block first to do the fractional part, then two integer FIR decimators.  \n   - Let Factor_1⋅Factor_2 = 4.  Then after Farrow we run 122.88 MHz →(÷2)→ 61.44 MHz →(÷2)→ 30.72 MHz.  \n   - That requires Farrow ratio = 122.88/150 = 0.8192 (–18.08%), which is our “fine adjustment.”  \n   - Both factors are integers >1: choose Factor_1 = 2, Factor_2 = 2.  \n   - Check the spacing constraint: Factor_2⋅FsLTERx – 2⋅Fpass = 2⋅30.72 MHz – 2⋅10 MHz = 41.44 MHz > 0.  \n\nWith these choices, the decimating filters see relaxed transition bands, the Farrow stage only adjusts by ~18%, and EVM targets (<0.03% RMS, <0.07% peak) can easily be met with Ap = 0.1 dB / Ast = 60 dB designs.', config=Config(Fpass=10000000.0, Fstop=15360000.0, Ast=60.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=2.0, Factor_2=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Error': "无法解析名称 'fdesign.decimator'。"}, 'score': 0.0}
