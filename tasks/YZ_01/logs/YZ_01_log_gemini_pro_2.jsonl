{"completion_tokens": 569, "response": "reasoning=\"Okay, let's break this down into the two tasks and fill in the required parameters for the JSON. \\n\\n**Task 1: Top Level Parameters**\\n\\n*   **Fpass:**  We need to accommodate a 10 MHz LTE bandwidth, so Fpass = 10 MHz.\\n*   **Fstop:** The initial suggestion is FsLTERx/2 = 30.72 MHz / 2 = 15.36 MHz. However, since we need to satisfy Factor_2 * FsLTERx - 2 * Fpass > 0, and we will determine Factor_2 in the next step, it is reasonable to start with Fstop = 15.36 MHz. \\n*   **Ast:** Stopband attenuation (Ast) depends on the filter design and how much out-of-band signal we want to reject.  Let's pick a reasonable value, say 60 dB.\\n*   **Ap:** Passband ripple (Ap) also depends on the filter design. A common value for Ap is 0.1 dB.\\n\\n**Task 2: Reduction Factors (Factor_1 and Factor_2)**\\n\\nSince Factor_1 is related to the Farrow rate converter, it is not needed in the current JSON. We only need the decimating filter factors here. Let's determine Factor_2 first. The problem states that Factor_2 * FsLTERx - 2 * Fpass > 0 MHz must be satisfied. Let's assume Factor_2 = 1, we have 30.72 - 2 * 10 = 10.72 > 0. Let's try Factor_2 = 2. Then, 2*30.72 - 2*10 = 41.44 > 0. If we choose Factor_2 = 3.  Then, 3*30.72 - 2*10 = 72.16 > 0.  Let's choose Factor_2 = 3 and Factor_1 = 2 based on experience and assumptions for this problem.\\n\\nI will populate the config based on the selected parameters.\" config=Config(Fpass=10000000.0, Fstop=15360000.0, Ast=60.0, Ap=0.1, Factor_1=2.0, Factor_2=3.0)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"Error": "\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u6790\u540d\u79f0 'fdesign.decimator'\u3002"}, "score": 0.0}
