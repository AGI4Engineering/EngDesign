## Task Description
You are given a Webots world file named 'construction_site.wbt' with some walls (obstacles) and a controller file named "robot_controller.py", you should first read the world info as shown below, then generate a trajectory from start point to goal point without hitting any obstacles. The trajectory should satisfy the following requirements: 

  1. The format of trajectory should be written as (t, X, Y, Z, v, a), where t is time, X, Y, Z are the 3D coordinates of the robot, v is velocity, a is acceleration. The small inspection robot's starting position is at the site entrance (0,0,0,0,0,0), and we set the goal position to the far corner inspection point (t,19,24,0,0,a). 
  2. The trajectory should follow the safety constraints: 
    2.1 In the WHITE_ZONE solid area, the robot's maximum speed should not exceed 1m/s;
    2.2 In the RED_ZONE solid area, the robot's maximum speed should not exceed 2m/s;
    2.3 In the GREEN_ZONE solid area, the robot's maximum speed should not exceed 0.5m/s;
  3. The entire trajectory can only be in the above three zones, i.e., the robot can not move out from those zones.

The construction_site.wbt contains the following world info (the length unit is meter):
