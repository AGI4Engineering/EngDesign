{'completion_tokens': 3388, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To plan a safe trajectory from the site entrance (0,0) to the far‐corner inspection point (19,24), I partitioned the site into its three allowed floor zones (WHITE, RED, GREEN) and bypassed all cubic obstacles by skirting around them in free corridors. In the WHITE_ZONE (X ∈ [–4.89,5.11], Y ∈ [–0.38,14.62]) I stay along X=2 to avoid OBSTACLE_2 at (–0.41,4.78) and OBSTACLE_3 at (1.58,11.04). Upon reaching the White→Red border at Y=14.62, I switch to the RED_ZONE (same X‐range, Y ∈ [14.61,29.61]) and continue north along X=2 to Y=19.61, which keeps clear of OBSTACLE_4 and OBSTACLE_1. Before entering the GREEN_ZONE I move east to X=5.13 at Y=19.61, then follow a straight eastward leg inside the GREEN_ZONE (X ∈ [5.13,20.13], Y ∈ [19.61,29.61]) to X=19, and finally head north to Y=24, avoiding the lone GREEN-zone obstacle at (13.45,24.52). Speed limits are respected: v=1 m/s in WHITE_ZONE, v=2 m/s in RED_ZONE, v=0.5 m/s in GREEN_ZONE.
