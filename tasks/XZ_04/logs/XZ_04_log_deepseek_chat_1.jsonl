{'completion_tokens': 836, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To generate the trajectory from the start point (0,0,0) to the goal point (19,24,0), we need to consider the zones and their speed constraints, as well as the obstacles present in the environment. The WHITE_ZONE spans from approximately (-5,0,0) to (5,15,0), the RED_ZONE spans from (-5,15,0) to (5,30,0), and the GREEN_ZONE spans from (5,15,0) to (20,30,0). The obstacles are located at (-0.41,4.78,0.5), (1.58,11.04,0.5), (3.24,21.69,0.5), (-1.76,18.4,0.5), and (13.45,24.52,0.5).\n\nThe path planning approach involves navigating through the WHITE_ZONE first, then transitioning into the RED_ZONE, and finally entering the GREEN_ZONE to reach the goal. The robot must avoid all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance. The speed constraints are enforced by adjusting the velocity in each zone: 1m/s in WHITE_ZONE, 2m/s in RED_ZONE, and 0.5m/s in GREEN_ZONE. Acceleration is assumed to be constant at 0.1 m/sÂ² for simplicity.\n\nThe trajectory is generated by breaking the path into segments within each zone, calculating the time and distance for each segment while respecting the speed limits.
