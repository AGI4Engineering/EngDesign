{'completion_tokens': 573, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To derive an execution plan for the matrix multiplication on the IPU Mk2, we need to consider the constraints and requirements of the hardware and the T10 benchmark. The matrix multiplication is defined as $C[m,n] += A[m,k]*B[k,n]$ with dimensions $m = 32$, $k = 5120$, and $n = 15360$. The IPU Mk2 has 1,472 cores, each with a 624KB scratchpad memory, and a high inter-core bandwidth.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1. **Operator Partitioning (F_op):**\n   - We need to partition the operator along dimensions $m$, $k$, and $n$.\n   - Choose $F_{op} = [2, 4, 8]$ to utilize 64 cores, which is a reasonable number to start with given the constraints.\n\n2. **Temporal Partitioning (f_t):**\n   - For tensor A, partition along $m$ and $k$.\n     - Choose $f_t^A_m = 1$ and $f_t^A_k = 2$.\n   - For tensor B, partition along $k$ and $n$.\n     - Choose $f_t^B_k = 2$ and $f_t^B_n = 4$.\n   - For tensor C, partition along $m$ and $n$.\n     - Choose $f_t^C_m = 1$ and $f_t^C_n = 4$.\n\n3. **Alignment and Constraints:**\n   - Ensure that the temporal partition factors align across shared dimensions.\n   - The chosen factors align well, as $f_t^A_k$ and $f_t^B_k$ are both 2, and $f_t^B_n$ and $f_t^C_n$ are both 4.\n\n4. **Memory and Core Utilization:**\n   - Ensure that the sub-tensor partitions do not overflow the per-core SRAM size.\n   - The chosen partitioning should fit within the memory constraints and utilize a reasonable number of cores.\n\n5. **Minimizing Execution Time:**\n   - The chosen partitioning aims to balance memory usage and communication overhead, minimizing total execution time.\n\nThis plan should provide a valid and efficient execution strategy for the given matrix multiplication on the IPU Mk2.', config=ConfigFile(F_op=[2, 4, 8], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=2, f_t_B_k=2, f_t_B_n=4, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=4)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [2, 4, 8], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 2, 'f_t_B_k': 2, 'f_t_B_n': 4, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 4, 'score': 20, 't10_time': 7018, 'ai_time': -1, 'passed': False}, 'score': 20.0}
