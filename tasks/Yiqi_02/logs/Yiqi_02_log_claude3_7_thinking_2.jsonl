Let's design our partitioning strategy:\n\n1. For F_op (spatial partitioning):\n   - For dimension m=32: Since it's small and a multiple of 16, using f_m=2 gives each core a perfect 16×16 aligned slice\n   - For dimension k=5120: This dimension is large and needs partitioning. Using f_k=16 seems reasonable\n   - For dimension n=15360: This is our largest dimension. With our other choices, we can use f_n=46 to utilize exactly 1,472 cores (2×16×46=1,472)\n\n2. Memory requirements check:\n   With F_op=[2,16,46], each core gets:\n   - A sub-tensor: [16, 320] (320=5120/16) ≈ 10KB\n   - B sub-tensor: [320, 334] (334≈15360/46) ≈ 214KB (will be padded to 336 for systolic array alignment)\n   - C sub-tensor: [16, 334] ≈ 11KB (also padded to 336)\n   Total: about 235KB, which fits well in 624KB memory\n\n3. For temporal partitioning:\n   To make better use of the systolic array and reduce memory footprint, let's partition dimension k temporally:\n   - f_t_A_k = f_t_B_k = 4 means each temporal slice is 320/4 = 80 elements\n   - This makes sub-computations sized [16,80,336] which aligns well with the 16×16 systolic array\n   - Memory per step: ~67KB (well within limits)\n   - Requires only 4 temporal steps, minimizing communication overhead\n\n4. For remaining dimensions, no temporal partitioning is needed:\n   - f_t_A_m = f_t_C_m = f_t_B_n = f_t_C_n = 1\n\nThis plan balances computation efficiency, memory usage, and communication overhead.", config=ConfigFile(F_op=[2, 16, 46], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=4, f_t_B_k=4, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [2, 16, 46], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 4, 'f_t_B_k': 4, 'f_t_B_n': 1, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 1, 'score': 20, 't10_time': 7018, 'ai_time': -1, 'passed': False}, 'score': 20.0}
