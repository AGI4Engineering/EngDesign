{'completion_tokens': 1563, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To derive an effective execution plan for the given matrix multiplication, I need to consider several constraints and optimize for performance:\n\n1. Problem dimensions: m=32, k=5120, n=15360 with FP16 data (2 bytes per element)\n2. Hardware: IPU Mk2 with 1,472 cores, each with 624KB private memory (systolic array 16×16)\n3. Need to ensure memory doesn't overflow per core\n4. Need to minimize execution time (computation + communication)\n\nStep 1: First, let's calculate the size of the tensors:\n- A[32, 5120] in FP16 = 32 * 5120 * 2 bytes = 327,680 bytes ≈ 320KB\n- B[5120, 15360] in FP16 = 5120 * 15360 * 2 bytes = 157,286,400 bytes ≈ 150MB\n- C[32, 15360] in FP16 = 32 * 15360 * 2 bytes = 983,040 bytes ≈ 960KB\n\nClearly, tensor B is too large for a single core's memory (624KB), so we need to partition it effectively.\n\nStep 2: Consider systolic array alignment requirements (16×16)\nThe dimensions should ideally be multiples of 16 for efficient use of the systolic array. Let's consider padding:\n- m=32 is already a multiple of 16\n- k=5120 is already a multiple of 16\n- n=15360 is already a multiple of 16\n\nStep 3: Determine operator partition factors (F_op)\nWe need to split the computation across multiple cores. Looking at dimensions:\n- m=32 (small): partitioning this could lead to inefficient use of the systolic array\n- k=5120 (medium): good candidate for partitioning\n- n=15360 (large): best candidate for partitioning since it's the largest dimension\n\nLet's set F_op = [2, 8, 46]. This will partition:\n- m into 2 parts (16 each)\n- k into 8 parts (640 each)\n- n into 46 parts (334 each, roughly 336 with padding)\n\nTotal cores used: 2 * 8 * 46 = 736 cores (well below the 1,472 limit)\n\nStep 4: Determine temporal partition factors\nFor tensor A[m,k]:\n- A is partitioned spatially by F_op across dimensions m and k\n- With f_s^A = [2, 8], each sub-tensor A is of size [16, 640]\n- Memory size of sub-tensor A: 16 * 640 * 2 bytes = 20,480 bytes ≈ 20KB\n- Since A is small enough, we can use f_t_A_m = 1 and f_t_A_k = 1\n\nFor tensor B[k,n]:\n- B is partitioned spatially by F_op across dimensions k and n\n- With f_s^B = [8, 46], each sub-tensor B is of size [640, 334]\n- Memory size of sub-tensor B: 640 * 334 * 2 bytes = 427,520 bytes ≈ 417KB\n- This fits within the 624KB limit, so we can use f_t_B_k = 1 and f_t_B_n = 1\n\nFor tensor C[m,n]:\n- C is partitioned spatially by F_op across dimensions m and n\n- With f_s^C = [2, 46], each sub-tensor C is of size [16, 334]\n- Memory size of sub-tensor C: 16 * 334 * 2 bytes = 10,688 bytes ≈ 10.4KB\n- This fits within the 624KB limit, so we can use f_t_C_m = 1 and f_t_C_n = 1\n\nHowever, I realized the above partition may not be optimal. Let me refine my approach:\n\nStep 5: Refined partition strategy\nLet's use F_op = [2, 32, 23] which gives us:\n- 2 partitions along m (16 each)\n- 32 partitions along k (160 each)\n- 23 partitions along n (667.83 which rounds to 668 each)\n\nTotal cores: 2 * 32 * 23 = 1,472 cores (exactly matches our limit)\n\nWith this partitioning:\n- Sub-tensor A[16, 160]: 16 * 160 * 2 = 5,120 bytes\n- Sub-tensor B[160, 668]: 160 * 668 * 2 = 213,760 bytes\n- Sub-tensor C[16, 668]: 16 * 668 * 2 = 21,376 bytes\n\nTotal per-core memory: 5,120 + 213,760 + 21,376 = 240,256 bytes (≈ 235KB) which fits well within 624KB\n\nFor temporal partitioning, I'll keep all factors at 1 since we have sufficient core capacity and memory to compute each sub-task directly without further partitioning:\n- f_t_A_m = 1\n- f_t_A_k = 1\n- f_t_B_k = 1\n- f_t_B_n = 1\n- f_t_C_m = 1\n- f_t_C_n = 1\n\nThis execution plan efficiently distributes the computation across all available cores while ensuring each core has sufficient memory for its computation and minimizing communication overhead.", config=ConfigFile(F_op=[2, 32, 23], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=1, f_t_B_k=1, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [2, 32, 23], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 1, 'f_t_B_k': 1, 'f_t_B_n': 1, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 1, 'score': np.float64(83.42157108881364), 't10_time': 7018, 'ai_time': np.float64(13400.0), 'passed': np.True_}, 'score': 83.42157108881364}
