{"completion_tokens": 1400, "response": "reasoning=\"Let's analyze the problem. The goal is to determine an execution plan for a matrix multiplication on an IPU Mk2 chip. We are given the dimensions of the matrices A, B, and C (m=32, k=5120, n=15360). We need to determine the operator partition factors (F_op) and temporal partition factors (f_t) for tensors A, B, and C along the m, k, and n dimensions, respectively. The plan must fit within the per-core SRAM size (624KB), use no more than 1472 cores, and minimize total execution time. Also, partition factors should comply with T10's constraints.\\n\\nGiven m=32, k=5120, n=15360, and a per-core memory of 624KB, we should try to minimize the communication. Since FP16 is 2 bytes, we can estimate the memory requirements for a single core if we were to fully replicate A and B. If the matrix multiplication is C[m,n] += A[m,k] * B[k,n], the shapes are A[32, 5120], B[5120, 15360], C[32, 15360]. The sizes are then A = 32 * 5120 * 2 = 327680 bytes, B = 5120 * 15360 * 2 = 157286400 bytes, and C = 32 * 15360 * 2 = 983040 bytes. Clearly, the B matrix is too large to store on a single core. Thus, we need to partition along the n dimension. \\n\\nLet's start by partitioning the operator across all the cores i.e. 1472 cores. We have 32*5120*15360 to compute, with a SRAM of 624KB. Thus we can use 32=32x1x1, 5120 = 1x5120x1, and 15360 = 1x1x15360. The factors can then be F_op=[1,1,1472]. The problem is that 1472 is not a factor of 15360.\\n\\nLet's consider partitioning along the 'm' and 'n' dimensions. We want a number of cores that is less than or equal to 1472. Let's choose F_op = [32, 1, 461]. The reasoning is that 32 * 461 = 14752. The other possibility is to divide the core up along k also, by choosing a number such as F_op=[32, 5, 92]. That equals to 14720.\\n\\nAlternatively, lets' try to partition the dimensions as evenly as possible. The factors of 32 are {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32}, factors of 5120 are {1, 2, 4, 5, ..., 5120}, factors of 15360 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, ..., 15360}.  Let's try F_op=[1, 1, 1472]. This will have each core working on A[32, 5120], B[5120, 15360/1472], and C[32, 15360/1472]. This means that each core has to fit 32*5120*2 + 5120 * (15360/1472) * 2 + 32 * (15360/1472) * 2 into its memory of 624KB = 639488.  This implies that A is 327680 bytes, B is 106506.8 bytes, and C is 3340.3 bytes. The total is less than 624KB, so it works. Since, it is hard to divide 15360/1472, and it has to be an integer we should change to F_op=[1, 1, 480]. \\n\\nThen we would have each core work on A[32, 5120], B[5120, 15360/480], C[32, 15360/480]. This makes things even easier. Each core can work on A[32,5120], which is 327680 bytes. B[5120, 32], which is 327680 bytes, C[32, 32] is 2048 bytes. This takes 480 cores, and each core needs to compute this much data. The total is still less than 624KB, so this is fine.  The temporal factors can then be f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=1, f_t_B_k=1, f_t_B_n = 1, f_t_C_m = 1, f_t_C_n = 1. \\n\\nFinal Answer:\\n\" config=ConfigFile(F_op=[1, 1, 480], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=1, f_t_B_k=1, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)", "passed": true, "evaluation_result": {"F_op": [1, 1, 480], "f_t_A_m": 1, "f_t_A_k": 1, "f_t_B_k": 1, "f_t_B_n": 1, "f_t_C_m": 1, "f_t_C_n": 1, "score": 64.83578881875911, "t10_time": 7018, "ai_time": 40960.0, "passed": true}, "score": 64.83578881875911}
