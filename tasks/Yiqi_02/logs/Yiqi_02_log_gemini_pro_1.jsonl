{"completion_tokens": 1998, "response": "reasoning='The problem requires us to find an optimal execution plan for a matrix multiplication $C[m,n] += A[m,k]*B[k,n]$ with $m=32, k=5120, n=15360$ on an IPU Mk2 chip. The plan involves choosing operator partition factors $F_{op}=[F_{op\\\\_m}, F_{op\\\\_k}, F_{op\\\\_n}]$ and temporal partition factors $f_t$ for tensors A, B, and C.\\\\n\\\\nConstraints and Goals:\\\\n1.  Number of cores used: $N_{cores} = F_{op\\\\_m} \\\\cdot F_{op\\\\_k} \\\\cdot F_{op\\\\_n} \\\\le 1472$.\\\\n2.  Per-core SRAM usage $\\\\le 624$ KB. Data is FP16 (2 bytes/element).\\\\n3.  Sub-MatMul dimensions on each core must be multiples of the systolic array shape ($16 \\\\times 16$). This means $m_c = \\\\lceil M/F_{op\\\\_m} \\\\rceil$, $k_c = \\\\lceil K/F_{op\\\\_k} \\\\rceil$, $n_c = \\\\lceil N/F_{op\\\\_n} \\\\rceil$ must be multiples of 16. Since $M, K, N$ are already multiples of 16, this means $F_{op\\\\_m}$ must be a factor of $32/16=2$ (i.e., 1 or 2); $F_{op\\\\_k}$ must be a factor of $5120/16=320$; and $F_{op\\\\_n}$ must be a factor of $15360/16=960$.\\\\n4.  Temporal partition factor constraints:\\\\n    a.  $(f_{t\\\\_A\\\\_m} \\\\cdot f_{t\\\\_A\\\\_k})$ must divide $F_{op\\\\_n}$.\\\\n    b.  $(f_{t\\\\_B\\\\_k} \\\\cdot f_{t\\\\_B\\\\_n})$ must divide $F_{op\\\\_m}$.\\\\n    c.  $(f_{t\\\\_C\\\\_m} \\\\cdot f_{t\\\\_C\\\\_n})$ must divide $F_{op\\\\_k}$.\\\\n    d.  Temporal factors on common dimensions must be aligned (one is a multiple of the other).\\\\n5.  Goal: Minimize total execution time. This is generally achieved by maximizing core utilization and minimizing temporal partitioning (i.e., $f_t=1$ for all tensor dimensions) if memory allows, as this reduces communication steps.\\\\n\\\\nStrategy:\\\\nStart by assuming all temporal partition factors ($f_{t\\\\_A\\\\_m}, f_{t\\\\_A\\\\_k}, f_{t\\\\_B\\\\_k}, f_{t\\\\_B\\\\_n}, f_{t\\\\_C\\\\_m}, f_{t\\\\_C\\\\_n}$) are 1. This choice satisfies alignment (d) and simplifies constraint (a-c) to $1 | F_{op\\\\_X}$ (always true if $F_{op\\\\_X} \\\\ge 1$).\\\\nWith $f_t=1$, memory per core is $2 \\\\times (m_c k_c + k_c n_c + m_c n_c)$. This must be $\\\\le 624 \\\\times 1024 = 638976$ bytes, so $m_c k_c + k_c n_c + m_c n_c \\\\le 319488$.\\\\n\\\\nExploration:\\\\nCase 1: $F_{op\\\\_m}=2$. Then $m_c = 32/2 = 16$. Max $F_{op\\\\_k} \\\\cdot F_{op\\\\_n} = 1472/2 = 736$.\\\\n   Try $F_{op\\\\_k}=16$ (factor of 320), $F_{op\\\\_n}=40$ (factor of 960). Then $F_{op\\\\_k}F_{op\\\\_n}=640 \\\\le 736$.\\\\n   $k_c = 5120/16 = 320$. $n_c = 15360/40 = 384$. All $m_c, k_c, n_c$ are multiples of 16.\\\\n   Memory elements: $16 \\\\cdot 320 + 320 \\\\cdot 384 + 16 \\\\cdot 384 = 5120 + 122880 + 6144 = 134144$.\\\\n   $134144 \\\\le 319488$. This is valid. Total cores: $2 \\\\cdot 16 \\\\cdot 40 = 1280$.\\\\n   Per-core memory: $2 \\\\times 134144 = 268288$ bytes ($\\\\approx 262$ KB).\\\\n\\\\nCase 2: $F_{op\\\\_m}=1$. Then $m_c = 32/1 = 32$. Max $F_{op\\\\_k} \\\\cdot F_{op\\\\_n} = 1472/1 = 1472$.\\\\n   Try $F_{op\\\\_k}=20$ (factor of 320), $F_{op\\\\_n}=64$ (factor of 960). Then $F_{op\\\\_k}F_{op\\\\_n}=1280 \\\\le 1472$.\\\\n   $k_c = 5120/20 = 256$. $n_c = 15360/64 = 240$. All $m_c, k_c, n_c$ are multiples of 16.\\\\n   Memory elements: $32 \\\\cdot 256 + 256 \\\\cdot 240 + 32 \\\\cdot 240 = 8192 + 61440 + 7680 = 77312$.\\\\n   $77312 \\\\le 319488$. This is valid. Total cores: $1 \\\\cdot 20 \\\\cdot 64 = 1280$.\\\\n   Per-core memory: $2 \\\\times 77312 = 154624$ bytes ($\\\\approx 151$ KB).\\\\n\\\\nDecision:\\\\nBoth explored plans use 1280 cores and $f_t=1$. The second plan ($F_{op}=[1,20,64]$) uses significantly less memory per core (151KB vs 262KB), providing more headroom and potentially better cache performance. The total computation per core ($m_c k_c n_c$) is $32 \\\\times 256 \\\\times 240 = 1,966,080$, which is the same for both plans. Thus, the second plan is selected.\\\\n\\\\nFinal Plan:\\\\n- $F_{op} = [1, 20, 64]$\\\\n- $f_{t\\\\_A\\\\_m} = 1$\\\\n- $f_{t\\\\_A\\\\_k} = 1$\\\\n- $f_{t\\\\_B\\\\_k} = 1$\\\\n- $f_{t\\\\_B\\\\_n} = 1$\\\\n- $f_{t\\\\_C\\\\_m} = 1$\\\\n- $f_{t\\\\_C\\\\_n} = 1$\\\\n\\\\nThis plan satisfies all constraints: $N_{cores}=1280 \\\\le 1472$. Memory/core=151KB $\\\\le 624$KB. Dimensions $m_c=32, k_c=256, n_c=240$ are multiples of 16. Temporal factor product constraints are met ($1|64, 1|1, 1|20$).
