Data type: FP16 (2 bytes).\\nHardware: 1472 cores, 624KB SRAM per core, 5.5GB/s inter-core bandwidth.\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1.  Sub-tensor partitions must fit within per-core SRAM (624KB).\\n2.  Partition factors must comply with T10 constraints.\\n3.  Use no more than 1472 cores.\\n4.

Each core has 624KB of SRAM. Let's aim to utilize all 1472 cores.\\n\\nConsider splitting the operator across all three dimensions. Then, to fully utilize the 1472 cores, we want to find F_op such that product(F_op) <= 1472. Also, since 1472 = 2^4 * 23 * 2, a few possible factorizations close to the dimensions of m, k, n include (16, 80, 1) -> 1280 or (16, 1, 90) -> 1440. \\n\\nFirst consider F_op = [16, 80, 1]. This means m is split into 16, k is split into 80 and n is split into 1. Hence, the tensor sizes in each core would be:\\nA[m/16, k/80] = A[2, 64]. Size of A = 2 * 64 * 2 bytes = 256 bytes\\nB[k/80, n/1] = B[64, 15360]. Size of B = 64 * 15360 * 2 bytes = 1920 KB\\nC[m/16, n/1] = C[2, 15360]. Size of C = 2 * 15360 * 2 bytes = 60 KB\\nThis won't work since B is too large.\\n\\nNow consider F_op = [16, 1, 90]. Then,\\nA[m/16, k/1] = A[2, 5120]. Size of A = 2 * 5120 * 2 bytes = 20 KB\\nB[k/1, n/90] = B[5120, 170.66]. Size of B = 5120 * (15360/90) * 2 bytes = ~174 KB\\nC[m/16, n/90] = C[2, 170.66]. Size of C = 2 * (15360/90) * 2 bytes = ~6.8KB\\nThis works, we are using 16 * 1 * 90 = 1440 cores <= 1472 cores. Since each core has 624KB, A,B,C can reside on a core.\\nSet f_t_A_m = 1, f_t_A_k = 1, f_t_B_k = 1, f_t_B_n = 1, f_t_C_m = 1, f_t_C_n = 1.
