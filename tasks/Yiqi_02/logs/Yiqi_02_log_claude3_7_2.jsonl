{'completion_tokens': 1379, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design an execution plan for the matrix multiplication $C[m,n] += A[m,k]*B[k,n]$ where $m = 32$, $k = 5120$, and $n = 15360$ on an IPU Mk2 chip, I need to determine the optimal partitioning scheme that balances memory usage, computation, and communication overhead.\n\nFirst, let me calculate the memory requirements of the full tensors:\n- Tensor A: $32 \\times 5120$ elements = 163,840 elements = 327,680 bytes (FP16)\n- Tensor B: $5120 \\times 15360$ elements = 78,643,200 elements = 157,286,400 bytes (FP16)\n- Tensor C: $32 \\times 15360$ elements = 491,520 elements = 983,040 bytes (FP16)\n\nTotal memory: 158,597,120 bytes ≈ 151.25 MB\n\nEach core has 624KB of memory, so we need to partition the tensors across multiple cores. The IPU has 1,472 cores in total, but we should aim to use as few as possible while still completing the computation efficiently.\n\n### Strategy for Partitioning\n\nTo determine the operator partition factor F_op=[f_m, f_k, f_n]:\n\n1. The dimensions of each core's systolic array are 16×16, so ideally our partitioning should result in sub-matrices that are multiples of 16 to avoid padding.\n2. We need to ensure the memory footprint on each core doesn't exceed 624KB.\n\n### Memory Calculation per Core\n\nWith partition factors F_op=[f_m, f_k, f_n], each core would need to store:\n- Sub-tensor A: $(32/f_m) \\times (5120/f_k)$ elements = $163,840/(f_m \\times f_k)$ elements\n- Sub-tensor B: $(5120/f_k) \\times (15360/f_n)$ elements = $78,643,200/(f_k \\times f_n)$ elements\n- Sub-tensor C: $(32/f_m) \\times (15360/f_n)$ elements = $491,520/(f_m \\times f_n)$ elements\n\n### Considering Temporal Partitioning\n\nIf we introduce temporal partitioning factors, we can further reduce the memory footprint on each core.\n\nLet's consider reasonable partitioning values:\n\n- For dimension m (32): Since this is small, we should keep f_m relatively small (2-4) to maintain good parallelism.\n- For dimension k (5120): This can be partitioned more aggressively to reduce memory requirements.\n- For dimension n (15360): This is the largest dimension and should be partitioned significantly.\n\nAfter considering various combinations, let's try F_op=[2, 32, 32]:\n\n- Number of cores used: 2 × 32 × 32 = 2,048 cores, which exceeds our limit of 1,472 cores.\n\nLet's adjust to F_op=[2, 16, 46]:\n- Number of cores used: 2 × 16 × 46 = 1,472 cores, which matches our limit.\n\nWith this partitioning:\n- Sub-tensor A size: (32/2) × (5120/16) = 16 × 320 = 5,120 elements = 10,240 bytes\n- Sub-tensor B size: (5120/16) × (15360/46) = 320 × 334 ≈ 106,880 elements ≈ 213,760 bytes\n- Sub-tensor C size: (16) × (334) = 5,344 elements = 10,688 bytes\n\nTotal memory per core: 234,688 bytes, which is well within our 624KB limit.\n\nHowever, this doesn't account for temporal partitioning yet. Let's adjust our approach.\n\nAfter analyzing various combinations, a more efficient plan would be to use F_op=[2, 8, 92] with appropriate temporal factors:\n\n- Number of cores used: 2 × 8 × 92 = 1,472 cores\n\nLet's assign temporal partition factors to optimize memory usage:\n- f_t_A_m = 1 (no temporal partitioning along m for A)\n- f_t_A_k = 2 (partition k dimension of A into 2)\n- f_t_B_k = 2 (partition k dimension of B into 2)\n- f_t_B_n = 1 (no temporal partitioning along n for B)\n- f_t_C_m = 1 (no temporal partitioning along m for C)\n- f_t_C_n = 1 (no temporal partitioning along n for C)\n\nThis configuration ensures alignment with the systolic array dimensions (16×16) while keeping the memory footprint within limits and maintaining reasonable communication overhead.", config=ConfigFile(F_op=[2, 8, 92], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=2, f_t_B_k=2, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [2, 8, 92], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 2, 'f_t_B_k': 2, 'f_t_B_n': 1, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 1, 'score': np.float64(57.24653301017927), 't10_time': 7018, 'ai_time': np.float64(84940.0), 'passed': np.True_}, 'score': 57.24653301017927}
