{'completion_tokens': 6177, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A convenient way to see how a single heat‐shield radius can meet all three constraints is to compare how the areas and the associated “ballistic coefficient” influence peak deceleration and the associated heating.  For a spherical craft of mass m = 250\u202fkg, drag coefficient Cd ≈ 0.47, and cross‐sectional area A = πr², the ballistic coefficient is β = m / (Cd A).  \n\n• Peak deceleration is roughly proportional to the dynamic pressure q = ½ ρ V² multiplied by the cross‐section.  Because the vehicle is light (250\u202fkg) and has a moderate speed (order of 5.5\u202fkm/s at about 40\u202fkm), a radius in the 0.5\u202fm to 0.7\u202fm range typically keeps maximum g‐loads below 30\u202fg.\n• The peak convective heat flux is sensitive to nose radius and flight speed.  Empirical correlations (such as the Sutton–Graves type) show that the peak flux scales roughly as ∝ V³ / √(Rn) at a given altitude density; increasing Rn reduces the peak heating.  For a 5.5\u202fkm/s reentry at about 40\u202fkm altitude, choosing a nose radius around 0.5\u202fm to 0.7\u202fm (thus a heat‐shield spherical radius of the same order) keeps the heating below 1000\u202fW/cm².\n• The total heat load (integral of heat flux over time) also remains under 100\u202fMJ/m² with a moderate ballistic coefficient.  A heat‐shield radius around 0.5–0.7\u202fm generally leads to peak heating well within the 1000\u202fW/cm² limit and a total heat load comfortably under 100\u202fMJ/m² for LEO returns.\n\nPutting these together, a radius of about 0.6\u202fm provides enough surface area to limit decelerations below 30\u202fg, keep the peak heat flux below 1000\u202fW/cm², and hold total heat load under 100\u202fMJ/m², all while avoiding an overly large shield.  Hence the recommended heat shield radius is about 0.6\u202fm.', config=ConfigFile(r=0.6)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'r': 0.6, 'q_max_W_per_cm2': 6747791.538502094, 'Q_J_per_m2': 2124165868.9466226, 'a_max_mps2': 12.863690943094909, 'passed': False}, 'score': 70}
