{'completion_tokens': 8384, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A rough “back‐of‐the‐envelope” analysis suggests that the constraints are not very tight for a modest 250\u202fkg sphere reentering at low‐Earth‐orbit speeds of around 7½\u202fkm/s. Typical correlations (both empirical data and simplified trajectory estimates) show that peak stagnation‐point heat fluxes for LEO‐like reentries rarely exceed 1000\u202fW/cm² unless the nose radius is made extremely small. Likewise, the integrated heat load for such speeds is well under 100\u202fMJ/m² for typical small capsules. Similarly, the maximum deceleration for a 250\u202fkg sphere at these speeds comes out below about 30\u202fg if the sphere is not too small in cross‐section. In practice, choosing a spherical heat shield of around 0.6–0.7\u202fm radius works well. That gives sufficient bluntness to keep the peak flux below 1000\u202fW/cm² and the total heat load below 100\u202fMJ/m², and the ballistic deceleration is also comfortably below 30\u202fg. Therefore, a good design choice would be a heat‐shield radius on the order of 0.7\u202fm.', config=ConfigFile(r=0.7)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'r': 0.7, 'q_max_W_per_cm2': 6247241.035420388, 'Q_J_per_m2': 1560611658.8179271, 'a_max_mps2': 17.508912672545843, 'passed': False}, 'score': 70}
