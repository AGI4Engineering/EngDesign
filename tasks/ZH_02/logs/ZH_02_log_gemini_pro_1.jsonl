{'completion_tokens': 1952, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The task is to determine an appropriate heat shield radius (R) for a spherical spacecraft re-entering Earth's atmosphere. The radius must satisfy three constraints: peak heat flux <= 1000 W/cm², total heat load <= 100 MJ/m², and peak deceleration <= 30g.\n\nSpacecraft properties:\n- Mass (m): 250 kg\n- Drag coefficient (C_D): 0.47\n- Initial velocity (V_e): 7.8 km/s = 7800 m/s\n- Entry flight path angle (gamma_e): -6 degrees\n- Peak heating occurs at 40km altitude, where velocity (V_ph) is 5500 m/s.\n\nLet's analyze each constraint:\n\n1.  **Peak Deceleration:**\n    For ballistic entry with a flight path angle of -6 degrees, the peak deceleration can be estimated using the Allen-Eggers formula, which is largely independent of the ballistic coefficient for non-shallow entries:\n    a_peak ≈ (V_e^2 * sin|gamma_e|) / (2 * e * H_scale)\n    Using V_e = 7800 m/s, gamma_e = -6 degrees, e ≈ 2.71828 (Euler's number), and atmospheric scale height H_scale ≈ 7500 m for Earth:\n    a_peak ≈ ( (7800 m/s)^2 * sin(6°) ) / (2 * 2.71828 * 7500 m)\n    a_peak ≈ (60.84e6 m²/s² * 0.104528) / 40774.2 m\n    a_peak ≈ 6359178 m²/s² / 40774.2 m ≈ 155.96 m/s²\n    In terms of g's (1g = 9.81 m/s²):\n    a_peak ≈ 155.96 / 9.81 ≈ 15.90 g.\n    This is well below the 30g limit. So, this constraint is satisfied and does not directly constrain R based on this common formula.\n\n2.  **Peak Heat Flux:**\n    The peak stagnation point convective heat flux (q_peak) can be estimated using the Sutton-Graves formula:\n    q_peak = C * sqrt(rho_atm / R) * V_ph^3\n    Where C ≈ 1.83e-4 (SI units: (kg/m³)^-0.5 * (m/s)^-3 * (W/m²) * m^0.5), rho_atm is atmospheric density at peak heating altitude (40km), V_ph is velocity at peak heating, and R is the nose radius (spacecraft radius here).\n    At 40km altitude, rho_atm ≈ 4.0 x 10^-3 kg/m³. V_ph = 5500 m/s.\n    q_peak = 1.83e-4 * sqrt(4.0e-3 kg/m³ / R) * (5500 m/s)^3\n    q_peak = 1.83e-4 * sqrt(4.0e-3) * (5500)^3 / sqrt(R)\n    q_peak = 1.83e-4 * 0.063245 * 1.66375e11 / sqrt(R)\n    q_peak ≈ 1.925e6 / sqrt(R) W/m².\n    The constraint is q_peak <= 1000 W/cm² = 1000 * (100 cm/m)² W/m² = 10^7 W/m².\n    So, 1.925e6 / sqrt(R) <= 10^7\n    sqrt(R) >= 1.925e6 / 10^7 = 0.1925\n    R >= (0.1925)^2 ≈ 0.03706 m.\n    This means R must be at least 3.71 cm.\n\n3.  **Total Heat Load:**\n    The total heat load (Q_total) is the integrated heat flux over time. A common preliminary estimate is that a fraction of the spacecraft's initial kinetic energy (KE) is absorbed by the vehicle as heat, distributed over its reference area (A = pi*R²).\n    KE_initial = 0.5 * m * V_e^2 = 0.5 * 250 kg * (7800 m/s)^2 = 7.605e9 J.\n    Let's assume C_H_avg = 1% (0.01) of KE_initial is absorbed by the vehicle. This is a typical assumption for preliminary analysis (values often range 0.5%-2%).\n    Total heat absorbed by vehicle (Q_abs) = C_H_avg * KE_initial = 0.01 * 7.605e9 J = 7.605e7 J.\n    This heat is experienced as a load Q_load (J/m²) over the heat shield area A = pi*R²:\n    Q_load = Q_abs / A = 7.605e7 J / (pi*R²).\n    The constraint is Q_load <= 100 MJ/m² = 10^8 J/m².\n    So, 7.605e7 / (pi*R²) <= 10^8\n    pi*R² >= 7.605e7 / 10^8 = 0.7605 m²\n    R² >= 0.7605 / pi ≈ 0.2420 m²\n    R >= sqrt(0.2420) ≈ 0.492 m.\n    The statement 'at 40km...lose about half the heat' can be interpreted as follows: KE lost by 40km is (7.605 - 0.5*250*5500^2) = 3.824 GJ, which is about half the initial KE. If 'heat' refers to heat absorbed by the vehicle, and the conversion efficiency C_H_avg is constant, then half the total heat is absorbed by 40km. This makes the 1% C_H_avg assumption self-consistent if the total absorbed heat is 7.605e7 J.\n\n4.  **Determining the Radius:**\n    We have two lower bounds for R:\n    - From peak heat flux: R >= 0.03706 m.\n    - From total heat load: R >= 0.492 m.\n    The peak deceleration constraint is satisfied (15.9g < 30g).\n    The more restrictive constraint is R >= 0.492 m.\n    To provide a 'reliable radius', we should choose a value that satisfies this with some margin.\n    Let's propose R = 0.55 m.\n\n    Verify constraints for R = 0.55 m:\n    -   Peak heat flux: q_peak = 1.925e6 / sqrt(0.55) ≈ 1.925e6 / 0.7416 ≈ 2.596e6 W/m² = 259.6 W/cm². This is <= 1000 W/cm². (OK)\n    -   Total heat load: Q_load = 7.605e7 J / (pi * (0.55 m)²) ≈ 7.605e7 J / 0.95033 m² ≈ 8.002e7 J/m² = 80.02 MJ/m². This is <= 100 MJ/m². (OK, with ~20% margin)\n    -   Peak deceleration: ~15.9g. This is <= 30g. (OK)\n\nTherefore, a radius of 0.55 meters is a suitable proposal.", config=ConfigFile(r=0.55)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'r': 0.55, 'q_max_W_per_cm2': 7047838.40340082, 'Q_J_per_m2': 2527932934.9447403, 'a_max_mps2': 10.809073639683918, 'passed': False}, 'score': 70}
