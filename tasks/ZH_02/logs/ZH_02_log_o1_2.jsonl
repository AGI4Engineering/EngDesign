{'completion_tokens': 3829, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A small ballistic sphere reentering from LEO at around 7–8 km/s will typically satisfy all three performance limits—peak flux under 1000 W/cm², total load under 100 MJ/m², and peak deceleration under 30g—using a nose radius on the order of half a meter. Keeping the blunt radius large enough reduces stagnation heating rates while still ensuring the overall deceleration stays well below 30g for a 250 kg capsule. Analyses of ballistic coefficients, approximate stagnation heating formulas, and known experience from small reentry vehicles indicate that a radius of about 0.5 m is sufficient for these constraints.', config=ConfigFile(r=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'r': 0.5, 'q_max_W_per_cm2': 7391835.277960174, 'Q_J_per_m2': 3058798851.2831364, 'a_max_mps2': 8.933118710482576, 'passed': False}, 'score': 70}
