The system is described by the state-space equations with uncertainties in the system matrix A and a dynamic uncertainty in the feedback path.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Task:\n\n1. **Understand the System Dynamics:**\n   - The system is described by the state-space equations with matrices A0, B1, B2, C1, C2, and the uncertainties \\( \\Delta A \\) and \\( \\Delta_{dyn} \\).\n   - The uncertainty \\( \\Delta A \\) is a convex combination of \\( 0.2I_4 \\) and \\( -0.2I_4 \\), which means it can vary within these bounds.\n   - The dynamic uncertainty \\( \\Delta_{dyn} \\) has an H-infinity norm bound of 1.\n\n2. **Formulate the Control Problem:**\n   - We need to design a feedback control law \\( u(t) = Kx(t) \\) such that the closed-loop system is robustly stable and satisfies the H-infinity performance criterion.\n   - The closed-loop system matrix becomes \\( A_{cl} = A_0 + B_2K + \\Delta A \\).\n\n3. **Robust Stability Criterion:**\n   - The closed-loop system must be Hurwitz for all \\( \\Delta A \\) within the specified bounds. This requires solving a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem to ensure that the eigenvalues of \\( A_{cl} \\) have negative real parts.\n\n4. **H-infinity Performance Criterion:**\n   - The transfer function from \\( w(t) \\) to \\( z(t) \\), denoted as \\( T_{zw}(s) \\), must satisfy \\( \\|T_{zw}\\|_\\infty < 0.3 \\).\n   - This involves setting up an LMI to ensure the H-infinity norm of the transfer function is below the specified threshold.\n\n5. **Solve the LMI Problem:**\n   - Use a semidefinite programming (SDP) solver to find the gain matrix K that satisfies both the robust stability and H-infinity performance criteria.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Check the computed gain matrix K to ensure it meets the requirements for all possible uncertainties.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the appropriate state-feedback gain matrix K for the given system.', config=ConfigFile(K=[-0.5, -1.2, -1.5, -2.0])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'isStable': True, 'HinfNorm': 0.25, 'meetsHinf': True}, 'score': 100.0}
