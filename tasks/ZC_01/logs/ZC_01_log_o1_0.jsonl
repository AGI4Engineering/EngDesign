{'completion_tokens': 9092, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Below is a sketch of how one can arrive at a suitable solution using an LMI/SDP‐based H∞ design.  In practice one sets up a standard robust‐H∞ optimization problem (for static state‐feedback), encoding both the “uncertainty in A” (through an LMI for polytopic or norm‐bounded ∆A) and the dynamic uncertainty (through H∞ constraints).  A solver such as YALMIP, SOSTOOLS, or MATLAB’s Robust Control Toolbox can be used to solve the resulting LMIs.  One valid solution that achieves robust stability for all ∆A ∈ Co{±0.2 I₄} and ∥∆dyn∥∞ ≤ 1 (as well as an H∞ norm below 0.3 from w to z) is the following 1×4 static gain:\n\n  K = [ -64.20, -49.86, -17.44, -2.86 ].\n\nThis satisfies the closed‐loop performance objective ∥Tzw∥∞ < 0.3 and also guarantees that the closed‐loop matrix is Hurwitz for all allowed ∆A and that the induced uncertainty loop is robustly stable for ∥∆dyn∥∞ ≤ 1.', config=ConfigFile(K=[-64.2, -49.86, -17.44, -2.86])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'isStable': True, 'HinfNorm': 0.015617128463476073, 'meetsHinf': True}, 'score': 100.0}
