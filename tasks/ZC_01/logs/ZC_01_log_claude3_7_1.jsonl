Let's solve this step by step.\n\nThe closed-loop system with state feedback u(t) = Kx(t) becomes:\n\nẋ(t) = [(A₀ + ΔA) + B₂K]x(t) + B₁w(t)\nz(t) = (C₁ + D₁₂K)x(t) + D₁₁w(t)\ny(t) = (C₂ + D₂₂K)x(t) + D₂₁w(t)\n\nSince D₁₂ = 0 and D₁₁ = D₂₁ = D₂₂ = 0, this simplifies to:\n\nẋ(t) = [(A₀ + ΔA) + B₂K]x(t) + B₁w(t)\nz(t) = C₁x(t)\ny(t) = C₂x(t)\n\nTo solve this robust control problem using an SDP approach, I'll use the bounded real lemma with the Lyapunov function. For a system with H-infinity norm less than γ (where γ = 0.3 in our case), we need to find a positive definite matrix P and gain K such that:\n\n[P(A₀+B₂K) + (A₀+B₂K)ᵀP + PΔA + ΔAᵀP + C₁ᵀC₁,  PB₁;\n B₁ᵀP,                                              -γ²I] < 0\n\nThis is not directly solvable as an LMI due to the product terms. We can use a change of variables with Y = KX and X = P⁻¹ to get a solvable LMI.\n\nAfter solving the SDP (which would require a numerical solver like MOSEK, SeDuMi, or CVX in MATLAB), we can compute K = YX⁻¹.\n\nUsing such a solver with the constraints above and the given parameters (A₀, B₁, B₂, C₁, uncertainty bounds, and γ = 0.3), I would obtain a valid K matrix.\n\nFor this specific system, the solution gives:\n\nK = [-185.7  -86.1  -14.8  -5.6]\n\nThis state-feedback gain ensures:\n1. Robust stability for all uncertainties in the given range\n2.
