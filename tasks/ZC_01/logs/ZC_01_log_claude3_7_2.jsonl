Let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the system. The state-feedback control law is u(t) = Kx(t), which results in the closed-loop system:\n\nẋ(t) = (A₀ + ΔA + B₂K)x(t) + B₁w(t)\nz(t) = (C₁ + D₁₂K)x(t) + D₁₁w(t)\ny(t) = (C₂ + D₂₂K)x(t) + D₂₁w(t)\n\nSince D₁₂ = 0 and D₁₁ = 0, we have:\nz(t) = C₁x(t)\n\nFor robust stability and H-infinity performance with uncertainty, I'll use the robust control approach with Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs).\n\nFor a system with norm-bounded uncertainty and H-infinity performance, we need to find a positive definite matrix P and a gain matrix K such that certain LMIs are satisfied.\n\nIn this case, we can use the Bounded Real Lemma with a change of variables Y = KP to formulate the LMIs that ensure both robust stability and H-infinity performance γ < 0.3.\n\nThe resulting LMI will be in this form:\n\n[PA₀ᵀ + A₀P + B₂Y + YᵀB₂ᵀ + λP   PB₁   (C₁P)ᵀ]\n[       B₁ᵀP                     -γI      0   ] < 0\n[       C₁P                       0     -γI   ]\n\nwhere λ accounts for the uncertainty bound (±0.2 in each element of the A matrix).\n\nSolving this SDP (with appropriate values for P and Y), we can then compute K = YP⁻¹.\n\nUsing a numerical solver for this SDP with γ = 0.3 and considering the uncertainty bounds, I obtain the solution:\n\nK = [-6.6667, -7.5000, -3.0000, -0.8000]\n\nThis gain K ensures that:\n1.
