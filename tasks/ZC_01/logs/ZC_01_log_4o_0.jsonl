The system is described by a set of matrices and uncertainties, and we need to ensure that the closed-loop system is stable and meets the performance criteria.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the System Dynamics:**\n   - The system is described by the state-space equations with uncertainties in the matrix A and a dynamic uncertainty in the feedback path.\n   - The nominal matrices A0, B1, B2, C1, C2, D11, D12, D21, and D22 are given.\n   - The uncertainty in A is described by \\( \\Delta A \\in \\mathrm{Co}\\{\\pm0.2\\,I_4\\} \\), which means it can vary within a convex combination of \\( 0.2I_4 \\) and \\( -0.2I_4 \\).\n   - The dynamic uncertainty \\( \\Delta_{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\) is such that its H-infinity norm is less than or equal to 1.\n\n2. **Formulate the Control Problem:**\n   - We need to design a feedback control law \\( u(t) = Kx(t) \\) where K is a 1x4 matrix.\n   - The closed-loop system should be robustly stable for all allowed uncertainties.\n   - The H-infinity norm of the transfer function from w to z, \\( T_{zw}(s) \\), should be less than 0.3.\n\n3. **Use of SDP for H-infinity Control:**\n   - The problem can be formulated as a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem, which is a standard approach for H-infinity control design.\n   - The LMI conditions will ensure that the closed-loop system is stable and meets the H-infinity performance criteria.\n\n4. **Design the Feedback Gain K:**\n   - Solve the LMI problem using a suitable solver (e.g., MATLAB's LMI toolbox or CVX).\n   - The solution will provide the feedback gain matrix K that satisfies the robust stability and performance requirements.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Check that the designed K ensures the closed-loop system is Hurwitz for all uncertainties.\n   - Verify that the H-infinity norm of the transfer function \\( T_{zw}(s) \\) is less than 0.3.\n\nBy following these steps, we can design the required feedback gain matrix K.", config=ConfigFile(K=[-0.5, -1.2, -1.5, -2.0])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'isStable': True, 'HinfNorm': 0.25, 'meetsHinf': True}, 'score': 100.0}
