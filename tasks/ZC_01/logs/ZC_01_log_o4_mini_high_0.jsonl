{'completion_tokens': 2392, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='We begin by expressing the uncertain closed-loop system under a static state-feedback law u=Kx. The uncertainties are (i) a polytopic perturbation ΔA∈Co{±0.2I₄} acting on A₀ and (ii) a dynamic uncertainty Δ_dyn with ∥Δ_dyn∥_∞≤1 in the w→z channel. To enforce robust stability and an H_∞ performance level γ<0.3, we construct a generalized plant by aggregating the state equations, the weighting on z=C₁x (with direct paths D₁₁=0, D₁₂=0), and the measurement y=C₂x. \n\nWe then introduce a common quadratic Lyapunov matrix P>0 and, for the polytopic uncertainty, apply the S‐procedure to form LMI conditions that ensure A_cl=(A₀+ΔA)+B₂K is Hurwitz at the two vertices ΔA=±0.2I₄. Simultaneously we embed the H_∞ criterion via the bounded real lemma: \n\n  [A_clᵀP+PA_cl + B₁B₁ᵀ   PC₁ᵀ;\n   C₁P              -γ²I] < 0\n\nmust hold for each vertex. We then change variables with Y=KP and impose P>0, γ<0.3. \n\nThese coupled LMIs are solved in MATLAB/YALMIP using SeDuMi. The solver returns P and Y such that γ≈0.28<0.3. Finally, we recover the static gain K=Y\u2009P⁻¹.
