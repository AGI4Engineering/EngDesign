With the state-feedback control u(t) = Kx(t), the closed-loop system becomes:\n\nẋ(t) = (A₀ + ΔA + B₂K)x(t) + B₁w(t)\nz(t) = C₁x(t) + D₁₂Kx(t)\n\nSince D₁₂ = 0, we have z(t) = C₁x(t).\n\nFor robust stability and H-infinity performance, I'll use a pole placement approach that ensures:\n1. The nominal closed-loop system poles are sufficiently far in the left half-plane\n2. Even with the uncertainty ΔA (with magnitude ±0.2I₄), the system remains stable\n3. The H-infinity norm of the transfer function from w to z is less than 0.3\n\nFor a SISO system with poles having sufficient negative real parts, the H-infinity norm is approximately dominated by the pole with the smallest magnitude. For a transfer function with poles at -p₁, -p₂, etc., we can estimate ‖G‖∞ ≈ 1/(2·min(p₁,p₂,...)).\n\nTo ensure ‖Tzw‖∞ < 0.3, I need min(p₁,p₂,...) > 1/(2·0.3) ≈ 1.67.\n\nI'll place the closed-loop poles at approximately -3, -3.1, -3.2, and -3.3. This gives the characteristic polynomial:\n(s+3)(s+3.1)(s+3.2)(s+3.3) = s⁴ + 12.6s³ + 58.32s² + 116.992s + 98.208\n\nThe closed-loop characteristic polynomial with feedback is:\ns⁴ + (2-k₄)s³ + (3-k₃)s² + (4-k₂)s + (5-k₁)\n\nMatching coefficients:\nk₄ = 2 - 12.6 = -10.6\nk₃ = 3 - 58.32 = -55.32\nk₂ = 4 - 116.992 = -112.992\nk₁ = 5 - 98.208 = -93.208\n\nRounding to make the gain more practical:\nK = [-93, -113, -55, -11]\n\nThis places the nominal closed-loop eigenvalues far enough in the left half-plane that:\n1. Even with uncertainty of ±0.2 in each eigenvalue, the system remains stable\n2. The H-infinity norm is approximately 1/(2·3) ≈ 0.167, which is well below the required 0.3", config=ConfigFile(K=[-93.0, -113.0, -55.0, -11.0])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'isStable': True, 'HinfNorm': 0.07352941176470588, 'meetsHinf': True}, 'score': 100.0}
