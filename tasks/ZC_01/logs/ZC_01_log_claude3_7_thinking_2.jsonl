Robust stability against polytopic uncertainty ΔA and dynamic uncertainty w(s)\n2. H-infinity performance requirement that ||Tzw||∞ < 0.3\n\nFor a state-feedback controller u(t) = Kx(t), the closed-loop system becomes:\n- ẋ(t) = (A₀ + ΔA + B₂K)x(t) + B₁w(t)\n- z(t) = C₁x(t) (since D₁₂ = 0)\n- w(s) = Δdyn(s)z(s), ||Δdyn||∞ ≤ 1\n\nI'll use the pole placement approach to design K. For the nominal system with state-feedback, the closed-loop A-matrix is:\nA₀ + B₂K = [0 1 0 0; \n             0 0 1 0; \n             k₁ k₂ k₃ k₄; \n             -5 -4 -3 -2]\n\nThe characteristic polynomial is:\ndet(sI - (A₀ + B₂K)) = s⁴ + (2-k₄)s³ + (3-k₃)s² + (4-k₂)s + (5-k₁)\n\nTo ensure robust stability with sufficient margin for both types of uncertainties, I'll place the closed-loop poles at [-2, -3, -4, -5], which gives the desired characteristic polynomial:\n(s+2)(s+3)(s+4)(s+5) = s⁴ + 14s³ + 71s² + 154s + 120\n\nMatching coefficients:\n- 2-k₄ = 14 → k₄ = -12\n- 3-k₃ = 71 → k₃ = -68\n- 4-k₂ = 154 → k₂ = -150\n- 5-k₁ = 120 → k₁ = -115\n\nThis gives K = [-115 -150 -68 -12], which:\n1. Places the nominal closed-loop poles well into the left half-plane\n2. Provides sufficient stability margin to handle the polytopic uncertainty of ±0.2I₄\n3. Should provide a robustly stable feedback loop with the dynamic uncertainty\n\nWith these poles placed far into the left half-plane, the closed-loop system should exhibit fast decay characteristics, which helps achieve the required H-infinity performance of ||Tzw||∞ < 0.3.", config=ConfigFile(K=[-115.0, -150.0, -68.0, -12.0])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'isStable': True, 'HinfNorm': 0.06285714285714282, 'meetsHinf': True}, 'score': 100.0}
