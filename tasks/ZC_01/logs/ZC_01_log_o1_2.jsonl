In practice one sets up the standard bounded‐real‐lemma LMIs for all vertices A0 ± 0.2I and enforces ‖Tzw‖∞ < 0.3 by means of a single Lyapunov variable P satisfying the appropriate inequalities. Solving numerically (for instance with YALMIP or Robust Control Toolbox) yields a static gain K that guarantees both robust stability and the required H∞ bound.
