{'completion_tokens': 1645, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The problem requires designing a static state-feedback gain K for an uncertain continuous-time system to ensure robust stability and achieve a specific H-infinity performance level. The steps to achieve this are:\n1.  System Definition: Identify the nominal system matrices A0, B1 (for disturbance w), B2 (for control u), C1 (for performance output z), D11, and D12 from the problem description.\n    A0 = [[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [-5, -4, -3, -2]]\n    B1 = [[0], [0], [0], [1]]\n    B2 = [[0], [0], [1], [0]]\n    C1 = [[1, 0, 0, 0]]\n    D11 = 0, D12 = 0.\n    The performance level is γ = 0.3.\n2.  Closed-Loop System: With state feedback u = Kx, the closed-loop system equations become:\n    dx/dt = (A0 + B2K + ΔA)x + B1w\n    z = (C1 + D12K)x + D11w\n    Since D12 = 0, the output equation is z = C1x + D11w. Let A_cl(ΔA) = A0 + B2K + ΔA.\n3.  Uncertainty Handling: The uncertainty ΔA is polytopic, ΔA ∈ Co{0.2*I4, -0.2*I4}. Let the vertices be ΔA1 = 0.2*I4 and ΔA2 = -0.2*I4.\n4.  H-infinity Performance LMI: The H-infinity performance constraint ||T_zw||_inf < γ for a system dx/dt = Ax + Bw, z = Cx + Dw is equivalent to the existence of a symmetric positive definite matrix P > 0 such that the following LMI holds:\n    [ A^T P + P A   P B     C^T ]\n    [ B^T P         -γI     D^T ] < 0\n    [ C             D       -γI ]\n    In this problem, D = D11 = 0.\n5.  Robust H-infinity Performance: To ensure robust H-infinity performance for the polytopic uncertainty in ΔA, the LMI must hold for each vertex of the uncertainty polytope. Thus, we need P > 0 such that the LMI holds for A = A_cl(ΔA1) and A = A_cl(ΔA2).\n    Let A_v1 = A0 + B2K + 0.2*I4 and A_v2 = A0 + B2K - 0.2*I4. The LMIs are (for v=v1, v2):\n    [ A_v^T P + P A_v   P B1    C1^T ]\n    [ B1^T P            -γI     0    ] < 0\n    [ C1                0       -γI  ]\n6.  Linearization of LMIs: The above LMIs are bilinear in P and K. A standard change of variables, X = P^-1 and Y = KX, is used to linearize them. Pre- and post-multiplying the LMI by diag(X, I, I) (where X is P^-1) yields:\n    [ A_v X + X A_v^T   B1    X C1^T ]\n    [ B1^T              -γI   0      ] < 0\n    [ C1 X              0     -γI    ]\n    The term A_v X + X A_v^T becomes:\n    (A0 + B2K + ΔAi)X + X(A0 + B2K + ΔAi)^T\n    = A0X + XA0^T + B2KX + XK^T B2^T + ΔAi X + X ΔAi^T\n    = A0X + XA0^T + B2Y + Y^T B2^T + ΔAi X + X ΔAi^T\n7.  Specific LMIs for Vertices:\n    For ΔA1 = 0.2*I4: ΔA1 X + X ΔA1^T = 0.2*I4*X + X*(0.2*I4)^T = 0.4X.\n    For ΔA2 = -0.2*I4: ΔA2 X + X ΔA2^T = -0.2*I4*X + X*(-0.2*I4)^T = -0.4X.\n    So, the two LMIs to be solved are:\n    LMI1 (for ΔA1 = +0.2*I4):\n    [ A0X + XA0^T + B2Y + Y^TB2^T + 0.4X   B1    X C1^T ]\n    [ B1^T                                 -γI   0      ] < 0\n    [ C1 X                                 0     -γI    ]\n    LMI2 (for ΔA2 = -0.2*I4):\n    [ A0X + XA0^T + B2Y + Y^TB2^T - 0.4X   B1    X C1^T ]\n    [ B1^T                                 -γI   0      ] < 0\n    [ C1 X                                 0     -γI    ]\n    Additionally, X must be positive definite (X > 0).\n8.  Solving the SDP: These LMIs constitute a Semidefinite Program (SDP) that can be solved for X (a 4x4 symmetric matrix) and Y (a 1x4 matrix). This was done using CVXPY with the SCS solver.\n9.  Calculating K: Once X and Y are found, the state-feedback gain is computed as K = Y * X^-1.\n10. Dynamic Uncertainty: The condition w(s) = Δ_dyn(s) z(s) with ||Δ_dyn||_inf <= 1 represents a dynamic uncertainty. The H-infinity constraint ||T_zw||_inf < γ, with γ = 0.3, ensures robust stability against this type of uncertainty via the small-gain theorem. Since γ = 0.3 < 1/||Δ_dyn||_inf_max = 1, the closed-loop system will be stable when interconnected with Δ_dyn.\n11.
