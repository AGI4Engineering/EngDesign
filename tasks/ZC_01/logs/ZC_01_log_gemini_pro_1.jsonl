{'completion_tokens': 1565, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The problem requires designing a static state-feedback gain K for an uncertain continuous-time system to achieve robust stability and H-infinity performance.\n\n1.  **System Representation**: The system is given by:\n    `dx/dt = (A0 + Delta_A)x + B1w + B2u`\n    `z = C1x + D11w + D12u`\n    Nominal matrices:\n    `A0 = [[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [-5, -4, -3, -2]]`\n    `B1 = [[0], [0], [0], [1]]`\n    `B2 = [[0], [0], [1], [0]]`\n    `C1 = [[1, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    `D11 = 0`, `D12 = 0`\n    Uncertainties:\n    `Delta_A = d * I_4`, where `d` is a scalar uncertainty in `[-0.2, 0.2]`. This interpretation comes from `Delta A \\in Co{0.2*I_4, -0.2*I_4}`, meaning `Delta A = lambda*(0.2*I_4) + (1-lambda)*(-0.2*I_4)` for `lambda \\in [0,1]`. This simplifies to `Delta A = (0.4*lambda - 0.2)*I_4`. Let `d = 0.4*lambda - 0.2`, then `d \\in [-0.2, 0.2]`. This is a polytopic uncertainty with two vertices corresponding to `d = -0.2` and `d = 0.2`.\n    Dynamic uncertainty: `w(s) = Delta_dyn(s) * z(s)` with `||Delta_dyn||_inf <= 1`.\n\n2.  **Control Law**: Static state-feedback `u = Kx`, where `K` is a `1x4` matrix.\n\n3.  **Closed-Loop System**: \n    Substituting `u = Kx`:\n    `dx/dt = (A0 + d*I_4 + B2K)x + B1w`\n    `z = C1x`\n    Let `A_cl(d) = A0 + d*I_4 + B2K`, `B_cl = B1`, `C_cl = C1`, `D_cl = 0`.\n    The transfer function from `w` to `z` is `T_zw(s) = C_cl * (sI - A_cl(d))^-1 * B_cl`.\n\n4.  **Design Objectives**:\n    *   Robust Stability: The closed-loop system must be Hurwitz for all `d \\in [-0.2, 0.2]` and for any `Delta_dyn` with `||Delta_dyn||_inf <= 1`.\n    *   H-infinity Performance: `||T_zw||_inf < gamma`, with `gamma = 0.3`. \n    If `||T_zw||_inf < gamma = 0.3 < 1`, then by the small gain theorem, the system is robustly stable against `Delta_dyn`. The polytopic uncertainty in `Delta_A` will be handled by designing for the vertices of the polytope.\n\n5.  **LMI Formulation for H-infinity State-Feedback Control**:\n    We seek a symmetric positive definite matrix `P > 0` and a gain `K` such that the H-infinity condition holds for all uncertainties.\n    Using the standard change of variables `X = P^-1` and `Y = KX`, the problem can be formulated as a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem.\n    The LMI must hold for each vertex of the uncertainty polytope (i.e., for `d = -0.2` and `d = 0.2`).\n    For each `d_v \\in \\{-0.2, 0.2\\}`, let `A_v = A0 + d_v*I_4`. The LMIs are:\n    Find `X = X' > 0` (4x4 matrix) and `Y` (1x4 matrix) such that:\n    [ A_v X + X A_v' + B2 Y + Y' B2'   B1       X C1'    ]\n    [ B1'                              -gamma   0        ]  < 0\n    [ C1 X                             0        -gamma   ]\n    where `Y' B2'` corresponds to `Y.T @ B2.T` in matrix programming if Y is defined as `m2 x n` (control input dim x state dim).\n    In the matrix above:\n    - `X` is a `4x4` symmetric positive definite matrix.\n    - `Y` is a `1x4` matrix.\n    - `gamma = 0.3`.\n    - `B1` is `4x1`. `C1` is `1x4`.\n    - The dimensions of the blocks are correctly formed, leading to a `(4+1+1)x(4+1+1) = 6x6` LMI matrix.\n\n6.  **Solving the SDP**:\n    The LMIs `X > epsilon*I` (for strict positive definiteness) and the H-infinity LMI conditions for `d = -0.2` and `d = 0.2` form an SDP problem. This SDP was solved using `cvxpy` in Python with the SCS solver (setting `eps_abs=1e-7`, `eps_rel=1e-7`, `max_iters=100000` for improved precision over default settings).\n    The solver found a feasible solution for `X` and `Y` (status `optimal_inaccurate`, which is common for SCS but generally provides usable results for well-posed problems).\n\n7.  **Calculating the Gain K**:\n    Once `X` and `Y` are found, the state-feedback gain is computed as `K = Y * X^-1`.\n    The numerical values obtained for `K` are provided in the `config` field.", config=ConfigFile(K=[-30.81107001174765, -40.49203317483236, -16.34381076547018, -5.897173840391853])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'isStable': True, 'HinfNorm': 0.13187037179704889, 'meetsHinf': True}, 'score': 100.0}
