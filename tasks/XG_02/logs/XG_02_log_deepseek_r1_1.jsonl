The compensator's transfer function is K(s) = (s + 232.56)/(s + 1070).\n5. **Gain Adjustment**: A proportional gain of 10 was added to meet the 0 dB crossover requirement at 534 rad/s (assuming plant magnitude ~-20 dB at this frequency).\n6. **Final Controller**: The combined controller is K(s) = 10(s + 232.56)/(s + 1070), with numerator [10, 2325.6] and denominator [1, 1070] after normalization.", config=ConfigFile(num=[10.0, 2325.6], den=[1.0, 1070.0])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'bandwidth_hz': inf, 'bandwidth_passed': False, 'gain_margin_db': -inf, 'phase_margin_deg': -inf, 'margins_passed': False}, 'score': 0.0}
