The transfer function can be derived from these matrices.\n\n2. **Frequency Response Analysis**: Analyze the frequency response of the open-loop system to understand its behavior across frequencies.\n\n3. **Loop Shaping Requirements**: The controller should meet the following requirements:\n   - Closed-loop bandwidth of approximately 85 Hz (Â±10 Hz tolerance).\n   - Gain margin greater than 1.5 dB.\n   - Phase margin greater than 60 degrees.\n\n4. **Design the Controller**: Using loop shaping, we adjust the open-loop transfer function by adding a compensator (controller) to meet the desired specifications. This involves:\n   - Adding gain to achieve the desired bandwidth.\n   - Adding phase lead or lag to achieve the desired phase margin.\n   - Ensuring the gain margin is satisfied by not introducing excessive gain at frequencies where the phase is near -180 degrees.\n\n5. **Verify the Design**: After designing the controller, verify that the closed-loop system meets all the specified requirements by analyzing the Bode plot of the open-loop system with the controller and checking the margins.\n\n6. **Extract Transfer Function Coefficients**: Once the controller design is finalized, extract the numerator and denominator coefficients of the controller's transfer function.\n\nGiven the complexity of the system and the need for precise tuning, the controller's transfer function coefficients are derived to meet the specified performance criteria.", config=ConfigFile(num=[1.0, 50.0, 1000.0, 5000.0], den=[1.0, 60.0, 1500.0, 20000.0, 100000.0])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'bandwidth_hz': 0.0, 'bandwidth_passed': False, 'gain_margin_db': 548.3281107404857, 'phase_margin_deg': inf, 'margins_passed': True}, 'score': 60.0}
