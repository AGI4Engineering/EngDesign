{'completion_tokens': 1343, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The task is to design a robust feedback controller using loop shaping for a given seventh-order state-space system. The performance requirements are: closed-loop bandwidth of approximately 85 Hz (±10 Hz), gain margin > 1.5 dB, and phase margin > 60 degrees.\n\n1.  **Controller Choice**: A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller with a filtered derivative term is chosen. Its transfer function is K(s) = K_p + K_i/s + K_d*s / (1 + s/N). This structure is versatile: the integral term (K_i/s) ensures high gain at low frequencies (good for tracking and disturbance rejection in positioning systems), while the proportional (K_p) and derivative (K_d*s / (1 + s/N)) terms provide lead compensation to meet phase margin and bandwidth requirements. The filter pole N makes the derivative term realizable and helps in attenuating high-frequency noise.\n\n2.  **Controller Transfer Function**: The chosen PID controller can be written as:\n    K(s) = ( (K_p + K_d*N)*s^2 + (K_p*N + K_i)*s + K_i*N ) / ( s^2 + N*s )\n    The numerator coefficients are `num = [K_p + K_d*N, K_p*N + K_i, K_i*N]` and denominator coefficients are `den = [1, N, 0]`, assuming standard descending powers of s.\n\n3.  **Parameter Design Strategy (Loop Shaping)**:\n    *   **Target Crossover Frequency (ω_c)**: The desired closed-loop bandwidth is ~85 Hz, which is 85 * 2π ≈ 534 rad/s. The open-loop gain crossover frequency ω_c should be near this value.\n    *   **Phase Margin (PM)**: Required PM > 60°. This means the phase of the loop transfer function L(jω_c) = P(jω_c)K(jω_c) should be greater than -120° at ω_c.\n    *   **Filter Pole (N)**: `N` is chosen to be significantly higher than ω_c to limit its phase lag contribution at ω_c. Let N = 2000 rad/s.\n    *   **Lead Compensation**: The terms K_p and K_d*N (and K_i) are selected to place the controller zeros appropriately to provide phase lead around ω_c. The controller K(s) with the chosen parameters has poles at s=0 and s=-2000 rad/s, and zeros at s ≈ -16.08 rad/s and s ≈ -128.8 rad/s. The zero at -128.8 rad/s and the pole at -2000 rad/s create a lead effect: (s+128.8)/(s+2000). This provides a maximum phase lead of approximately 61.4° at ω_m = sqrt(128.8 * 2000) ≈ 507.5 rad/s (around 80.8 Hz). This frequency is within the desired bandwidth range (75-95 Hz) and the phase lead is sufficient to achieve the 60° PM target, assuming the plant's phase needs such compensation.\n    *   **Parameter Values**: Based on this strategy, a plausible set of PID parameters is: \n        K_p = 100\n        K_i = 1440\n        K_d = 0.645\n        N = 2000 rad/s\n        These parameters are illustrative; actual tuning would involve simulating with the specific plant model P(s) to adjust the overall loop gain (primarily via K_p) to ensure |L(jω_c)| = 1 at the target ω_c and to verify all specifications.\n\n4.  **Controller Coefficients Calculation**:\n    Using the parameters above:\n    Numerator coefficients:\n    num_s2 (coeff for s^2) = K_p + K_d*N = 100 + 0.645 * 2000 = 100 + 1290 = 1390\n    num_s1 (coeff for s^1) = K_p*N + K_i = 100 * 2000 + 1440 = 200000 + 1440 = 201440\n    num_s0 (coeff for s^0) = K_i*N = 1440 * 2000 = 2880000\n    So, num = [1390.0, 201440.0, 2880000.0].\n\n    Denominator coefficients:\n    den_s2 (coeff for s^2) = 1\n    den_s1 (coeff for s^1) = N = 2000\n    den_s0 (coeff for s^0) = 0\n    So, den = [1.0, 2000.0, 0.0].\n\nThis controller is biproper (numerator and denominator have the same order). The design provides the necessary phase lead around the target bandwidth, incorporates an integrator for low-frequency performance, and includes a high-frequency pole for the derivative action.", config=ConfigFile(num=[1390.0, 201440.0, 2880000.0], den=[1.0, 2000.0, 0.0])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'bandwidth_hz': inf, 'bandwidth_passed': False, 'gain_margin_db': -inf, 'phase_margin_deg': -inf, 'margins_passed': False}, 'score': 0.0}
