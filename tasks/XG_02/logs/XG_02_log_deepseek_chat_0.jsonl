{'completion_tokens': 352, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a robust feedback controller using the loop shaping method for the given seventh-order nanopositioning stage, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **System Analysis**: First, analyze the given state-space model to understand its frequency response characteristics. The system's open-loop frequency response will help in determining the necessary compensations.\n\n2. **Loop Shaping Requirements**: Based on the performance requirements:\n   - **Closed-loop bandwidth**: Target is 85 Hz (Â±10 Hz). This translates to a desired crossover frequency around 85 Hz (534.07 rad/s).\n   - **Gain margin**: >1.5 dB.\n   - **Phase margin**: >60 degrees.\n\n3. **Controller Design**: Use a lead-lag compensator to shape the open-loop transfer function to meet the requirements. The compensator will:\n   - Increase the gain at low frequencies to ensure good tracking.\n   - Provide sufficient phase lead around the crossover frequency to achieve the desired phase margin.\n   - Roll off at high frequencies to avoid amplifying noise.\n\n4. **Implementation**: The designed controller's transfer function is derived by tuning the compensator parameters (pole, zero, and gain) to meet the loop shaping criteria. The resulting numerator (num) and denominator (den) coefficients are provided in the config section.\n\n5. **Verification**: Simulate the closed-loop system to ensure the bandwidth, gain margin, and phase margin requirements are met.", config=ConfigFile(num=[0.5, 150.0, 3000.0], den=[1.0, 200.0, 1000.0])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'bandwidth_hz': 1.2976684853083293, 'bandwidth_passed': False, 'gain_margin_db': 1.4690293559628034, 'phase_margin_deg': 32.27893574265208, 'margins_passed': False}, 'score': 0.0}
