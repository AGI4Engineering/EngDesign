{'completion_tokens': 416, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a robust feedback controller using the loop shaping method for the given seventh-order nanopositioning stage, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the System**: The system is represented by a state-space model with matrices A, B, C, and D. The system is high-order (7th order), which suggests that a careful approach is needed for controller design.\n\n2. **Frequency Response Analysis**: First, we analyze the frequency response of the open-loop system to understand its behavior across frequencies. This helps in identifying the current gain and phase margins.\n\n3. **Loop Shaping Requirements**: The requirements are:\n   - Closed-loop bandwidth: 85 Hz (Â±10 Hz tolerance)\n   - Gain margin: >1.5 dB\n   - Phase margin: >60 degrees\n\n4. **Controller Design**: Using loop shaping, we design a controller that modifies the open-loop frequency response to meet the requirements. This typically involves:\n   - Adding gain to meet the bandwidth requirement.\n   - Adding phase lead or lag to improve phase margin.\n   - Ensuring the gain crossover frequency is around 85 Hz (534.07 rad/s).\n\n5. **Iterative Tuning**: The controller is tuned iteratively to meet all requirements. For a 7th order system, a PID or higher-order compensator might be necessary.\n\n6. **Validation**: The designed controller is validated by checking the closed-loop bandwidth, gain margin, and phase margin.\n\nGiven the complexity of the system, the exact controller coefficients (num and den) would typically be derived using control design software (e.g., MATLAB's Control System Toolbox) to meet the specified requirements.
