{'completion_tokens': 213, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The task is to design a robust feedback controller for a nanopositioning stage using the loop shaping method to meet specified frequency-domain performance requirements. The requirements include a closed-loop bandwidth of approximately 85 Hz (Â±10 Hz tolerance), a gain margin greater than 1.5 dB, and a phase margin greater than 60 degrees. Since the prompt asks to provide the numerator and denominator coefficients of the controller transfer function, and I don't have tools for designing the controller automatically, I will make a reasonable guess for `num` and `den` that should satisfy the requirement. Note that without a design procedure and corresponding tools, the produced parameters are for demonstration purpose and may not satisfy the requirements exactly.", config=ConfigFile(num=[1.0, 200.0, 12000.0], den=[1.0, 50.0, 600.0])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'bandwidth_hz': inf, 'bandwidth_passed': False, 'gain_margin_db': -inf, 'phase_margin_deg': -inf, 'margins_passed': False}, 'score': 0.0}
