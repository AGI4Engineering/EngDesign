First, I'll analyze the plant model to understand its characteristics\n2. Then I'll design a controller using loop shaping principles to meet the requirements\n3. Finally, I'll validate that the controller meets the specifications\n\nGiven requirements:\n- Closed-loop bandwidth of approximately 85 Hz (±10 Hz tolerance)\n- Gain margin > 1.5 dB\n- Phase margin > 60 degrees\n\nStep 1: Understanding the plant model\nThe given system is a seventh-order linear state-space model. For control design using loop shaping, I need to work with the transfer function representation.\n\nThe plant transfer function can be derived from the state-space model (A, B, C, D). Without computing the exact transfer function, I can note that it's a complex 7th-order system that will likely have multiple resonant modes typical of nanopositioning stages.\n\nStep 2: Loop shaping controller design\nFor nanopositioning systems, a common approach is to use a PID-type controller with additional filtering. Given the high-order plant and precision requirements, I'll design a controller with:\n\n- A proportional term for basic tracking\n- An integral term to eliminate steady-state error\n- A low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency noise and ensure roll-off\n\nFor a nanopositioning stage with bandwidth requirements of ~85 Hz, a good starting point is a PI controller with a second-order low-pass filter. This will create a controller of the form:\n\nC(s) = K_p (s + z_i)/(s) * 1/(s²/ω_n² + 2ζs/ω_n + 1)\n\nWhere:\n- K_p is the proportional gain\n- z_i is the zero from the integral term\n- ω_n is the natural frequency of the low-pass filter\n- ζ is the damping ratio of the filter\n\nFor a bandwidth of 85 Hz (≈ 534 rad/s), I'll set:\n- K_p = 2.5 to provide adequate loop gain\n- z_i = 50 rad/s to provide strong integral action at low frequencies\n- ω_n = 2000 rad/s (well above the bandwidth)\n- ζ = 0.7 for good damping in the filter\n\nThis gives us a controller transfer function of:\nC(s) = 2.5(s + 50)/(s) * 1/(s²/2000² + 2*0.7*s/2000 + 1)\n\nExpanding this:\nC(s) = 2.5(s + 50)/(s * (s²/4000000 + 0.0007s + 1))\n= 2.5(s + 50)/(s³/4000000 + 0.0007s² + s)\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by 4000000:\nC(s) = 10000000(s + 50)/(s³ + 2800s² + 4000000s)\n\nTherefore, the controller transfer function is:\nC(s) = (10000000s + 500000000)/(s³ + 2800s² + 4000000s)\n\nThis can be represented with numerator and denominator coefficient vectors as:\nnum = [0, 10000000, 500000000]\nden = [1, 2800, 4000000, 0]\n\nHowever, I notice the denominator has a zero at the end, which means there's a pole at s=0 (the integral term). Let's represent it correctly:\nnum = [10000000, 500000000, 0]\nden = [1, 2800, 4000000, 0]\n\nSimplifying and removing the common factor of s:\nnum = [10000000, 500000000]\nden = [1, 2800, 4000000]", config=ConfigFile(num=[10000000.0, 500000000.0], den=[1.0, 2800.0, 4000000.0])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'bandwidth_hz': inf, 'bandwidth_passed': False, 'gain_margin_db': -inf, 'phase_margin_deg': -inf, 'margins_passed': False}, 'score': 0.0}
