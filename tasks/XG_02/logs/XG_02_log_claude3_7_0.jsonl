{'completion_tokens': 1249, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I need to design a controller for the given 7th-order state-space system to meet specific frequency domain requirements. For nanopositioning systems, a common controller structure is a PI or lead-lag type controller, which provides good low-frequency tracking through integral action, adequate phase margin through lead compensation, and sufficient gain margin by limiting high-frequency gain. For a closed-loop bandwidth of approximately 85 Hz (±10 Hz), which equals about 534 rad/s (±63 rad/s), I selected a controller with the structure C(s) = K * (s + 20)/(s * (s + 200)), which provides integral action for zero steady-state error, a zero at s = -20 to provide phase lead at the desired crossover frequency, a pole at s = -200 to limit high-frequency gain, and gain K = 150 to adjust the crossover frequency. Converting this to transfer function form: C(s) = 150(s + 20)/(s(s + 200)) = 150(s + 20)/(s^2 + 200s), which gives numerator coefficients [150, 3000] and denominator coefficients [1, 200, 0].', config=ConfigFile(num=[150.0, 3000.0], den=[1.0, 200.0, 0.0])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'bandwidth_hz': 1.5536795325190202, 'bandwidth_passed': False, 'gain_margin_db': 3.6994686030271815, 'phase_margin_deg': 113.13254905405641, 'margins_passed': True}, 'score': 60.0}
