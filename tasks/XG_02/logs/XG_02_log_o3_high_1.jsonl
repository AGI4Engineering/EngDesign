The low-frequency behaviour is lightly damped and almost rigid-body with |G(jω)|≈2.4×10⁴  (-92 dB) at ω =2π·1 Hz and a −40 dB/dec slope until the first lightly-damped resonance appears a little above 1 kHz.  In the frequency region of interest (1-500 Hz) the phase of the plant is approximately −175° at 85 Hz, so we have to provide roughly +115° of phase to reach the desired ≥60° phase margin at crossover.\n\nStep-2  Loop-shaping objectives\n • Crossover (band-width) fc ≈85 Hz  → ωc ≈ 2π·85 ≈ 5.34×10² rad s⁻¹.\n • Gain margin  >1.5 dB (≈1.19).\n • Phase margin >60°.\n • Robust roll-off to protect against spill-over past the first resonance ( >1 kHz).\nWe therefore need (i) integral action for zero steady-state error, (ii) two lead zeros centred an order of magnitude below ωc to give phase boost, and (iii) a double high-frequency pole roughly an order of magnitude above ωc to attenuate sensor noise and guarantee gain margin.\n\nStep-3  Controller architecture chosen\n           ⎧            (s+z)²          ⎫\n  C(s)=K · ⎨  ————————————  ⎬ ,     z = 2π·50  ≈ 3.14×10²\n           ⎩  s (s+p)²           ⎭      p = 2π·500 ≈ 3.14×10³\nThis is an "integral-double-lead / double-lag" network (integrator + two identical lead zeros + two identical lag poles).  It supplies ≈+55…60° phase around ωc and yields the desired ‑20 dB/dec roll-off for robustness.\n\nStep-4  Numerical coefficient calculation\nZeros   (s+z)²  →  s² + 2z s + z² \nPoles   s(s+p)² →  s³ + 2p s² + p² s\nInsert z=314.159, p=3141.59 and tune K so that |C(jωc)G(jωc)|≈1.
