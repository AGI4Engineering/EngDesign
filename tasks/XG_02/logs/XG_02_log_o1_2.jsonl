{'completion_tokens': 3314, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Below is an illustrative example of how one might perform loop shaping on a high-order nanopositioning stage so as to achieve roughly an 85 Hz closed-loop bandwidth (≈530 rad/s), with at least 1.5 dB of gain margin and 60° of phase margin. Because exact numeric tuning will depend on the plant’s actual Bode plot, the final controller inevitably requires some iteration (e.g., using software like MATLAB’s sisotool or loopshaping commands). Nevertheless, a simple approach is to use a single integrator (ensuring zero steady-state error), a lead (to boost phase around crossover), and a roll-off pole (to control high-frequency gain). One can then adjust the overall DC gain and the exact pole/zero locations to bring the unity-gain crossover near 85 Hz and meet the desired margins.\n\nA suitable controller structure often employed is of the form:\n\n  C(s) = K × (s + z) / [ s × (s + p) ],\n\nwhere:\n•  1/s enforces integral action.\n•  The term (s + z) provides a lead zero to increase the phase near cross\xadover.\n•  The high-frequency roll-off pole (s + p)\n•  K is chosen so that the open-loop |L(jω)| crosses 0 dB near ω ≈ 2π×85 rad/s.\n\nBelow is one plausible choice:\n\n  C(s) = 4.2×10^5 × (s + 50) / [ s (s + 1200) ].\n\nHere:\n•  The zero at s = -50 rad/s provides phase lead in the 10–1000 rad/s range.\n•  The pole at s = -1200 rad/s attenuates high-frequency noise.\n•  The integrator (the factor of 1/s) enforces zero steady-state error.\n•  The overall gain 4.2×10^5 sets the unity-gain crossover to around 530 rad/s (≈ 85 Hz), if the plant referencing is consistent with the given B, C, and D.\n\nThough some minor retuning (of K, z, and p) may be necessary to precisely meet the ±10 Hz bandwidth tolerance and guarantee ≥60° phase margin and ≥1.5 dB gain margin, this is a suitable starting point. The final controller transfer function is:\n\n  C(s) = (4.2×10^5 × (s + 50)) / [s (s + 1200)].', config=ConfigFile(num=[420000.0, 21000000.0], den=[1.0, 1200.0, 0.0])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'bandwidth_hz': inf, 'bandwidth_passed': False, 'gain_margin_db': -inf, 'phase_margin_deg': -inf, 'margins_passed': False}, 'score': 0.0}
