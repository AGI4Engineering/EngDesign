Let me approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements:\n- Closed-loop bandwidth: approximately 85 Hz (±10 Hz tolerance)\n- Gain margin: greater than 1.5 dB\n- Phase margin: greater than 60 degrees\n\nFor nanopositioning systems, controllers need to ensure stability with adequate margins while providing good tracking performance. A common approach for such high-precision systems is to use a PI (Proportional-Integral) controller, which provides:\n- Zero steady-state error for constant references (through integral action)\n- Sufficient gain at crossover frequencies (through proportional action)\n\nThe transfer function of a PI controller is:\nK(s) = Kp + Ki/s = (Kp·s + Ki)/s\n\nTo achieve a bandwidth around 85 Hz (approximately 534 rad/s), I'll select controller parameters that will:\n1. Place the loop gain crossover frequency near 534 rad/s\n2. Ensure sufficient phase margin at this frequency\n3. Maintain adequate gain margin at higher frequencies\n\nFor this type of nanopositioning system, appropriate PI controller parameters would be:\n- Kp = 100 (proportional gain to set approximate bandwidth)\n- Ki = 5000 (integral gain to ensure zero steady-state error)\n\nThis gives us the controller transfer function:\nK(s) = (100s + 5000)/s\n\nWhen implemented with the 7th-order plant, this controller structure should provide the required bandwidth and stability margins, while maintaining good positioning accuracy.", config=ConfigFile(num=[100.0, 5000.0], den=[1.0, 0.0])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'bandwidth_hz': inf, 'bandwidth_passed': False, 'gain_margin_db': -inf, 'phase_margin_deg': -inf, 'margins_passed': False}, 'score': 0.0}
