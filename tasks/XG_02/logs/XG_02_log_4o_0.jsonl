This system represents the dynamics of the nanopositioning stage.\n\n2. **Define Performance Requirements**: The requirements are a closed-loop bandwidth of approximately 85 Hz (Â±10 Hz tolerance), a gain margin greater than 1.5 dB, and a phase margin greater than 60 degrees.\n\n3. **Convert State-Space to Transfer Function**: We need to convert the state-space representation to a transfer function to apply loop shaping. The transfer function G(s) is given by:\n   \\[ G(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D \\]\n   This involves calculating the inverse of (sI - A) and then performing matrix multiplications.\n\n4. **Design the Controller**: Using the loop shaping method, we design a controller K(s) such that the open-loop transfer function L(s) = K(s)G(s) meets the performance requirements. This involves:\n   - Shaping the loop gain to achieve the desired bandwidth.\n   - Ensuring the gain and phase margins are met.\n\n5. **Iterate and Validate**: Adjust the controller parameters iteratively to ensure all performance criteria are satisfied. This may involve using tools like Bode plots to visualize the frequency response and margins.\n\n6. **Extract Controller Coefficients**: Once the controller is designed, extract the numerator and denominator coefficients of the transfer function K(s).\n\nFor this task, I will assume a simple PID controller structure for K(s) and adjust its parameters to meet the requirements. The final step is to provide the coefficients of the controller's transfer function.", config=ConfigFile(num=[1.0, 0.5, 0.1], den=[1.0, 2.0, 1.0])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'bandwidth_hz': inf, 'bandwidth_passed': False, 'gain_margin_db': -inf, 'phase_margin_deg': -inf, 'margins_passed': False}, 'score': 0.0}
