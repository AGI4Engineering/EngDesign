{'completion_tokens': 1219, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I designed a controller for the nanopositioning stage using loop shaping principles. For this 7th-order system, I created a controller with integral action (for zero steady-state error), a zero for phase lead near the crossover frequency, and a high-frequency pole for roll-off. Based on the 85 Hz bandwidth requirement, I placed a zero at 200 rad/s, a pole at 1000 rad/s (besides the integrator at s=0), and set the gain to 50. This structure should provide sufficient phase margin (>60Â°) and gain margin (>1.5 dB) while achieving the target bandwidth. The resulting transfer function is C(s) = 50(s+200)/(s(s+1000)), which translates to numerator coefficients [10000, 50] and denominator coefficients [0, 1000, 1] in ascending powers of s.', config=ConfigFile(num=[10000.0, 50.0], den=[0.0, 1000.0, 1.0])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'bandwidth_hz': inf, 'bandwidth_passed': False, 'gain_margin_db': -inf, 'phase_margin_deg': -inf, 'margins_passed': False}, 'score': 0.0}
