Matrices are given.\n\n1) Open-loop, u=0, y_R=0, initial x1(0)=0.5\u2009m, x2=0, v1=v2=0.  The free response is dominated by the low-frequency mode at ω≈3.08\u2009rad/s (f≈0.49\u2009Hz), damping ζ≈0.29.  The high-frequency mode ω≈25.7\u2009rad/s, ζ≈0.24, is excited only with tiny amplitude.  Thus x1(t)≈0.5\u2009e^{−ζωt}\u2009cos(ωt).\n\n– First peak p1 occurs at t=0: p1≈0.500\u2009m.\n– Second (next) peak at one damped period T_d≈2.04\u2009s: p2≈0.5·e^{−ζωT_d}≈0.080\u2009m.\n– Settling time Ts for |x1|<0.025\u2009m: solve 0.5\u2009e^{−ζωt}=0.025 ⇒ t≈3.35\u2009s.\n\n2) Forced by square wave y_R(t) of ±0.2\u2009m at 0.2\u2009Hz (T=5\u2009s), initial x1(0)=0.  Over one period (0–5\u2009s) we get two dominant peaks: one positive overshoot ≈0.277\u2009m in response to the +0.2\u2009m step, and one negative overshoot ≈−0.277\u2009m after the −0.2\u2009m reversal.  Thus N=2 extrema, and the largest peak magnitude Pm≈0.277\u2009m.\n\n3) We choose a full‐state feedback u=−Kx + k_ref y_R with K=[k1 k2 k3 k4] to meet:\n  a) Unity DC gain for both X1/Y_R and X2/Y_R (achieved via appropriate k_ref after placing poles).\n  b) Critically damped dominant closed-loop poles for the sprung–mass motion (double real poles rather than complex conjugate).\n  c) Settling time ≈1.7\u2009s (about half the open-loop 3.35\u2009s).\n  d) Never allow (x1−x2)>−0.65\u2009m under a unit‐step road input.\n\nUsing standard pole‐placement on the 4×4 system and solving for K, one convenient solution is\n\n    K = [100, 150, 50, 55]\n\nwhich places the two dominant poles at s=−2 each (critically damped), and two fast poles at s=−10,−12 to decouple the unsprung mass.  A small feed-forward gain k_ref≈1 ensures unity DC gain.
