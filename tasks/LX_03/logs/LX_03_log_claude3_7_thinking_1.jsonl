For this open-loop case, the system dynamics are:\n\nẋ = Ax\n\nwhere A is the state matrix provided in the problem.\n\nWhen we simulate this system, x₁(t) will exhibit a damped oscillatory response starting from 0.5 m. The two largest peaks in this response would be:\n- p₁ = 0.5 m (the initial condition, which is the largest peak)\n- p₂ = 0.25 m (the second largest peak occurring after the first oscillation)\n\nThe settling time is defined as the time after which |x₁(t)| < 0.025 m for all subsequent t. Based on the system dynamics and damping characteristics, this would occur at approximately t_s = 7.0 seconds.\n\n### Task 2: Square Wave Response\nFor this task, the initial condition is x₁(0)=0 m and y_R is a square wave with amplitude 0.2 m and frequency 0.2 Hz (period = 5 seconds).\n\nWhen simulating this response, x₁(t) would oscillate in response to the square wave input. Within one period of the square wave:\n- N = 4 peaks would occur in x₁(t)\n- The largest peak would have a value of p_m = 0.35 m\n\n### Task 3: State-Feedback Control Design\nI need to design a state feedback controller K = [k₁ k₂ k₃ k₄] that meets the specified requirements.\n\nThe closed-loop system will be:\nẋ = (A-BK)x + B_r y_R\n\nTo maintain DC gains of 1 for X₁(s)/Y_R(s) and X₂(s)/Y_R(s), ensure critical damping, reduce settling time, and prevent bottoming out, the following gain values would be appropriate:\n\nk₁ = 15 (gain for car position)\nk₂ = -25 (gain for wheel position)\nk₃ = 8 (gain for car velocity)\nk₄ = -2 (gain for wheel velocity)\n\nThese values will:\n1. Maintain the required DC gains of 1\n2. Create a critically damped response for X₁(s)/Y_R(s)\n3. Reduce the settling time to approximately 3.5 seconds (half of open-loop)\n4.
