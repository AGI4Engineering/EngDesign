This is a 4th-order system representing the coupled car body and wheel motion. The system appears to be underdamped, which means we'll see oscillatory behavior. With x₁(0)=0.5m, the first peak p₁ would be this initial value (0.5m). The second largest peak p₂ would be the first negative excursion. Based on the system parameters in matrix A, I estimated a damping ratio around 0.3, which means the negative peak would be approximately e^(-π×0.3)×0.5 ≈ -0.19m. For the settling time, using the time constant approximation for the dominant poles, I calculated ts ≈ 4.2 seconds (when |x₁(t)| permanently stays below 0.025m).\n\nPart 2 - Response to square wave input:\nWith a square wave input of amplitude 0.2m and frequency 0.2Hz (period 5s), I analyzed how many peaks would occur in x₁(t) within one period. Given the system's natural frequency (approximately 0.5Hz based on matrix A elements), we would see about 2.5 oscillation cycles in 5 seconds, resulting in N=5 peaks per period. The maximum peak amplitude pm would be enhanced by partial resonance, reaching approximately 0.3m.\n\nPart 3 - State-feedback controller design:\nTo design a controller that meets all requirements, I considered the physics of the suspension system. The gain k₁ affects car body stiffness, k₂ affects wheel stiffness, while k₃ and k₄ provide damping to the car body and wheel respectively. To maintain unity DC gain while achieving critical damping and reducing settling time by half, I selected values that provide sufficient damping (k₃=10) while maintaining appropriate stiffness relationships between body and wheel (k₁=20, k₂=-30). The value k₄=-5 helps control wheel dynamics to prevent suspension bottoming out under the constraint x₁(t)-x₂(t)>-0.65m.", config=ConfigFile(p1=0.5, p2=-0.19, ts=4.2, N=5.0, pm=0.3, k1=20.0, k2=-30.0, k3=10.0, k4=-5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'p1': 'p1 is correct', 'p2': 'p2 is wrong', 'ts': 'ts is wrong', 'N': 'N is wrong', 'pm': 'pm is wrong', 'dcgain': 'DC gain is not met', 'critical': 'critically damped closed-loop response is not met', 'settlingTime': 'settling time is met', 'bottomOut': 'no bottom out is met'}, 'score': 44.0}
