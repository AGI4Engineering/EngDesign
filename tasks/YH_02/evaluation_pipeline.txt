The evaluation script performs the following steps after the LLM generates an HLS design:
	1.	The LLM-generated response is passed to Vitis HLS for synthesis and simulation.
	2.	Vitis HLS produces a report containing performance and resource utilization metrics.
	3.	The report is parsed into a structured JSON format, and relevant metrics are extracted.
    4. A final score is then computed based on a predefined rubric, returning an instruction and a numerical evaluation for the given HLS design.

The final insturction will give the guidance for LLM in the next potential generation if there are bugs in the generated design.
