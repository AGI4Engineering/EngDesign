The matrices A, B, and C are divided into tiles of size TM\u00d7TK, TK\u00d7TN, and TM\u00d7TN, respectively. The tiled loops iterate over the M, N, and K dimensions, processing one tile at a time. Inside the inner loops, the tiles are loaded into local buffers localA[TM][TK], localB[TK][TN], and localC[TM][TN]. Array partitioning is applied to these local buffers to enable parallel access to the data. Specifically, localA is partitioned across dimension 2, localB is partitioned across dimension 1, and localC is fully partitioned across all dimensions. Pipelining is applied to the inner loops to achieve an initiation interval (II) of 1. The dataflow pragma is used to enable concurrent execution of memory access and computation phases. Vivado HLS interface pragmas are assigned to the A, B, and C arrays to map them to different memory bundles (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2) using m_axi interfaces.

For example, the tile sizes (TM, TN, TK) were chosen based on a trade-off between data reuse and on-chip memory requirements. Larger tile sizes can improve data reuse but also increase the memory footprint, potentially leading to resource limitations. Similarly, the array partitioning scheme was carefully selected to achieve an initiation interval (II) of 1 while minimizing the overhead of memory access and control logic. The choice of using m_axi interfaces with separate memory bundles (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2) for the A, B, and C arrays was crucial for maximizing memory bandwidth and enabling parallel access to the data. While more complex partitioning schemes or dataflow architectures could have potentially yielded further performance improvements, they would have also increased the design complexity and development time.', conclusion='In conclusion, a high-performance matrix multiplication (GEMM) kernel was successfully implemented on a VCK5000 FPGA using Vivado HLS.
