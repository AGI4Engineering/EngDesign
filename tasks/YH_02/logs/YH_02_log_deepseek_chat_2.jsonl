The tile sizes were chosen to balance resource utilization and performance. Array partitioning was carefully applied to ensure the compiler could achieve II=1 in the inner loops.

The tile size of 128 was chosen as a balance between maximizing data reuse and minimizing resource overhead. The partitioning strategy was critical to achieving II=1 in the inner loops.
