The tile size of 128\u00d7128 was chosen to maximize resource utilization while fitting within the FPGA's memory and DSP constraints. While larger tiles might offer better theoretical performance, they would exceed the available resources. The partitioning strategy was carefully tuned to enable II=1 in the inner loops without requiring excessive manual unrolling. The use of separate memory bundles for each matrix enables parallel memory access, though this requires careful management of memory bandwidth.\", conclusion='This implementation successfully demonstrates a high-performance GEMM operation optimized for the VCK5000 FPGA platform. Through careful tiling, array partitioning, and pipelining, the design achieves II=1 in the inner loops and maximizes DSP utilization. The approach balances computational efficiency with resource constraints, providing a template for implementing other matrix operations on FPGA. Future work could explore adaptive tile sizing based on problem dimensions and automatic tuning of partitioning strategies for different FPGA platforms.
