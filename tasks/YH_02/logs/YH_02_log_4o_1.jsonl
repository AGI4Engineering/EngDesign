Its computational intensity makes it a prime candidate for hardware acceleration, particularly on FPGA platforms where parallelism and custom dataflow can be exploited. Historically, matrix operations have transitioned from CPU to GPU accelerations, but FPGAs now offer the potential for greater customization and energy efficiency.
