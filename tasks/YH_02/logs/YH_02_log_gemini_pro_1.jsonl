Define Global Parameters: Set M, N, K = 1024 and tile dimensions TM, TN, TK = 128.\\n2. Design Tiled Algorithm: Implement nested loops iterating over tiles of A, B, and C. Inside these, further loops handle copying tiles to local on-chip buffers (localA, localB, localC) and computing the tiled product.\\n3. Declare Local Buffers: Use `float localA[TM][TK]`, `localB[TK][TN]`, `localC[TM][TN]`.\\n4. Apply Array Partitioning: Partition `localA` completely along dimension 2, `localB` completely along dimension 1, and `localC` completely across all dimensions. This enables massive parallel access to buffer elements.\\n5. Implement Compute Kernel: The core computation `localC[i][j] += localA[i][k] * localB[k][j]` is structured with a loop over `k_tile` (0 to TK-1), then `i_tile` (0 to TM-1), then `j_tile` (0 to TN-1). The problem asks for pipelining the 'inner loops' with II=1 and implies unrolling from partitioning. This is interpreted as pipelining the `k_tile` loop with II=1, which, due to the full partitioning of `localC` and the specified partitioning of `localA` and `localB`, should lead HLS to unroll the `i_tile` and `j_tile` loops. This results in TM*TN parallel MAC operations.\\n6. Apply Pipelining: `#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1` is applied to the `k_tile` loop within the tile computation, and also to loops for data loading/storing and initialization of `localC` tiles for efficiency.\\n7. Enable Dataflow: `#pragma HLS DATAFLOW` is applied at the top level of the function to enable overlap between loading tiles, computing tile products, and storing result tiles.\\n8. Configure AXI Interfaces: Use `#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi` for global memory arrays A, B, C, mapping them to separate bundles. Use `#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite` for control and base address passing.\\n9. DSP Maximization: The combination of tiling, aggressive partitioning, and pipelining aims to create a large number of parallel MAC operations (`TM*TN = 128*128 = 16384`), which HLS will attempt to map to DSPs, thus maximizing their potential usage up to the VCK5000's limit.\"), results=Results(parameters='Key design parameters: Matrix dimensions M=N=K=1024.

Expected II for k_tile loop: 1 (assuming sufficient resources and effective unrolling of i_tile, j_tile loops by HLS). Memory interface: m_axi (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2) for data, s_axilite for control.'), discussion_conclusion=Discussion_Conclusion(discussion=\"The design choices aim for maximum parallelism. The tiling strategy (TM=TN=TK=128) breaks down the 1024x1024 matrices into 8x8 tiles. The specified array partitioning (localA dim 2, localB dim 1, localC fully) is crucial. If the `k_tile` loop (iterating TK times) is pipelined with II=1, and the `i_tile` (TM iterations) and `j_tile` (TN iterations) loops are fully unrolled (as implied by 'II=1 with pipelining will automatically imply sufficient unrolling'), this would instantiate TM*TN = 128*128 = 16384 parallel MAC units. Each unit performs TK operations over TK cycles. \\nCost vs Performance: This level of parallelism (16384 DSPs) significantly exceeds the VCK5000's capacity (1968 DSPs). HLS will limit the number of concurrently active MAC units to what fits, likely by reducing unrolling or sharing resources, potentially increasing the II of the `k_tile` loop or the overall latency of the compute tile stage. The local buffer sizes are substantial: localA and localB are 128x128 floats (64KB each), localC is 128x128 floats (64KB). Full partitioning of these into registers would require approximately 3 * 128 * 128 * 4 bytes * 8 bits/byte FFs for data = 1,572,864 FFs, which is a large portion of the VCK5000's 1.7M FFs. This high resource demand is a direct consequence of targeting extreme parallelism. The DATAFLOW pragma should help hide memory latency by overlapping load/compute/store of tiles, which is essential for overall throughput.\", conclusion=\"The HLS design for GEMM (M=N=K=1024, TM=TN=TK=128) is structured to theoretically achieve very high parallelism by requesting 16,384 DSP units through aggressive partitioning and pipelining strategies. While the VCK5000's 1,968 DSPs will cap this, the design intends to maximize their utilization. The extensive use of on-chip memory via partitioned local buffers is critical for feeding these parallel units. The final performance will depend on Vivado HLS's ability to map this highly parallel specification onto the VCK5000 architecture, balancing resource constraints with the requested parallelism. This design serves as an example of pushing HLS capabilities for computationally intensive tasks, highlighting the trade-offs between theoretical parallelism and practical hardware limits. Further refinement might involve adjusting tile sizes or unroll factors to better match specific resource limits while still achieving high throughput.\")) config=ConfigFile(ops_num=1073741824.0, parameters=Parameters(board_name=5000.0, max_DSP=1968.0, max_FF=1700000.0, max_LUT=818000.0, optimal_DSP=16384.0, optimal_FF=1572864.0, optimal_LUT=600000.0, m_size=1024.0, n_size=1024.0, k_size=1024.0), hls_design='#include <hls_stream.h>\\n#include <ap_int.h>\\n#include <ap_axi_sdata.h> // Included as requested\\n\\n#define M_SIZE 1024\\n#define N_SIZE 1024\\n#define K_SIZE 1024\\n\\n#define TM 128\\n#define TN 128\\n#define TK 128\\n\\nextern \"C\" {\\n\\nvoid gemm(float A[M_SIZE][K_SIZE], float B[K_SIZE][N_SIZE], float C[M_SIZE][N_SIZE]) {\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=A offset=slave bundle=gmem0 depth=1048576\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=B offset=slave bundle=gmem1 depth=1048576\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=C offset=slave bundle=gmem2 depth=1048576\\n\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=A bundle=control\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=B bundle=control\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=C bundle=control\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=return bundle=control\\n\\n    #pragma HLS DATAFLOW\\n\\n    // Local buffers\\n    float localA[TM][TK];\\n    #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localA complete dim=2 \\n\\n    float localB[TK][TN];\\n    #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localB complete dim=1\\n\\n    float localC[TM][TN];\\n    #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localC complete dim=0\\n\\n    // Tiled loops\\n    LOOP_M_OUTER: for (int m_outer = 0; m_outer < M_SIZE; m_outer += TM) {\\n        LOOP_N_OUTER: for (int n_outer = 0; n_outer < N_SIZE; n_outer += TN) {\\n            \\n            INIT_LOCAL_C: for (int i_init = 0; i_init < TM; ++i_init) {\\n                for (int j_init = 0; j_init < TN; ++j_init) {\\n                    #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1 \\n                    localC[i_init][j_init] = 0.0f;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            \\n            LOOP_K_OUTER: for (int k_outer = 0; k_outer < K_SIZE; k_outer += TK) {\\n                // Load A tile\\n                LOAD_A_TILE: for (int i_load_a = 0; i_load_a < TM; ++i_load_a) {\\n                    for (int k_load_a = 0; k_load_a < TK; ++k_load_a) {\\n                        #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\\n                        localA[i_load_a][k_load_a] = A[m_outer + i_load_a][k_outer + k_load_a];\\n                    }\\n                }\\n\\n                // Load B tile\\n                LOAD_B_TILE: for (int k_load_b = 0; k_load_b < TK; ++k_load_b) {\\n                    for (int j_load_b = 0; j_load_b < TN; ++j_load_b) {\\n                        #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\\n                        localB[k_load_b][j_load_b] = B[k_outer + k_load_b][n_outer + j_load_b];\\n                    }\\n                }\\n\\n                // Compute: localC += localA * localB\\n                COMPUTE_TILE: for (int k_tile = 0; k_tile < TK; ++k_tile) { \\n                    #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1 \\n                    for (int i_tile = 0; i_tile < TM; ++i_tile) {\\n                        // #pragma HLS UNROLL // Implied by parent loop pipeline and partitioning for II=1\\n                        for (int j_tile = 0; j_tile < TN; ++j_tile) {\\n                            // #pragma HLS UNROLL // Implied by parent loop pipeline and partitioning for II=1\\n                            localC[i_tile][j_tile] += localA[i_tile][k_tile] * localB[k_tile][j_tile];\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            } // End K_OUTER loop\\n\\n            // Store C tile\\n            STORE_C_TILE: for (int i_store_c = 0; i_store_c < TM; ++i_store_c) {\\n                for (int j_store_c = 0; j_store_c < TN; ++j_store_c) {\\n                    #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\\n                    C[m_outer + i_store_c][n_outer + j_store_c] = localC[i_store_c][j_store_c];\\n                }\\n            }\\n        } // End N_OUTER loop\\n    } // End M_OUTER loop\\n} // End gemm function\\n\\n} // extern \"C\"\\n')", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": "Simulation failed", "score": 0}
