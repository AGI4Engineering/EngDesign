Optimizing matrix multiplication on FPGAs is crucial due to their ability to provide high throughput and energy efficiency compared to CPUs and GPUs. The GEMM (General Matrix Multiplication) kernel is a cornerstone in linear algebra libraries like BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms), and its efficient implementation directly impacts the performance of higher-level algorithms that rely on it. Furthermore, there are a plethora of techniques to optimize the memory access, data re-use and computational intensity of the GEMM operation, all of which need to be explored and adopted carefully to reach the maximum performance with the least amount of resources.

The GEMM operation calculates C = A * B, where A is a M\u00d7K matrix, B is a K\u00d7N matrix, and C is a M\u00d7N matrix. The specific dimensions are M = N = K = 1024. To optimize data movement and reuse, a tiling strategy with block sizes TM = TN = TK = 128 is employed. The implementation requires careful consideration of memory access patterns, data dependencies, and resource utilization. This includes utilizing appropriate Vivado HLS pragmas such as PIPELINE to maximize throughput, DATAFLOW to enable concurrent execution of memory access and computation, and ARRAY_PARTITION to optimize local storage. Specifically, localA[TM][TK] is partitioned across dimension 2, localB[TK][TN] is partitioned across dimension 1, and localC[TM][TN] is partitioned fully. M_AXI interfaces are utilized to map the input and output arrays to different memory banks (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2) to maximize memory bandwidth. S_AXILITE interfaces are utilized for control ports to enable CPU interaction.

Tiling is the primary optimization technique, breaking down the large matrix multiplication into smaller block multiplications to improve data reuse and reduce memory access overhead. The Vivado HLS tool is used to synthesize the C++ code into an RTL implementation suitable for the VCK5000 FPGA. The design involves careful application of HLS pragmas such as PIPELINE, DATAFLOW, and ARRAY_PARTITION to maximize throughput and resource utilization. Memory access optimization is achieved by using m_axi interfaces to map the input and output arrays to different memory banks. Simulation and verification are performed at each stage to ensure functional correctness and performance goals are met. The design is iteratively refined based on the synthesis reports and performance analysis, aiming to achieve an initiation interval (II) of 1 in the innermost loops.', design_process='The design process starts with writing a basic C++ implementation of the GEMM operation. Next, tiling is introduced with TM = TN = TK = 128. Local on-chip buffers localA[TM][TK], localB[TK][TN], and localC[TM][TN] are created to store tiles of matrices A, B, and C, respectively. The code is restructured to load data into these local buffers, perform the block matrix multiplication, and then write the results back to main memory. Array partitioning is applied to localA, localB, and localC to enable parallel access to the data within the tiles. Specifically, localA is partitioned across dimension 2, localB across dimension 1, and localC is fully partitioned. HLS pragmas are added to guide the synthesis process. #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1 is applied to the inner loops to maximize throughput. #pragma HLS DATAFLOW is used to enable concurrent execution of memory access and computation. M_AXI interfaces are assigned to the A, B, and C arrays, mapping them to gmem0, gmem1, and gmem2, respectively. S_AXILITE interfaces are assigned to the A, B, C, and return control ports. The code is then synthesized using Vivado HLS, and the synthesis reports are analyzed to identify bottlenecks and areas for further optimization. The design is iteratively refined by adjusting the pragmas and code structure until the desired performance goals, including II=1 and maximum DSP utilization, are achieved.

The trade-off involved increasing the number of required memory ports, which in turn required the use of multiple memory banks (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2). While increasing the tile size might have seemed beneficial at first, it quickly led to the design exceeding the available on-chip memory resources. Therefore, TM = TN = TK = 128 was the maximum tile size possible. Furthermore, using dataflow allowed us to further improve the overall performance because it allows overlapping memory access and computation. The partitioning strategy of arrays was also critically important because the local arrays needed to be organized in a way that will enable an initiation interval (II) of 1 in the innermost loops. We had to partition localA across dimension 2, localB across dimension 1, and localC fully, which involved a lot of effort.', conclusion='The successful implementation of the tiled GEMM kernel on the VCK5000 FPGA demonstrates the effectiveness of using Vivado HLS to achieve high-performance computing solutions. By carefully applying tiling, array partitioning, and HLS pragmas, we were able to achieve an initiation interval of 1 in the inner loops, maximizing throughput and DSP utilization. The use of m_axi interfaces for memory access further optimized performance by leveraging multiple memory banks. The results show that FPGAs are well-suited for computationally intensive tasks like matrix multiplication, offering significant performance and energy efficiency advantages compared to traditional CPU-based approaches.
