The computation follows a block-based strategy with memory handling optimized for the FPGA architecture.', design_process='The implementation uses a three-level nested loop structure to iterate through tiles along the M, N, and K dimensions. For each tile position, we allocate local buffers for the input and output data: localA[TM][TK], localB[TK][TN], and localC[TM][TN].\n\nTo maximize DSP utilization, we apply array partitioning strategies based on the access patterns: localA is partitioned across the K dimension (dim 2) to allow parallel access to multiple elements when multiplying with elements from B; localB is partitioned across the M dimension (dim 1) to enable parallel access patterns when multiplying with elements from A; localC is fully partitioned to allow parallel updates to all elements.\n\nThe innermost computation loop is pipelined with II=1, enabling the initiation of a new multiplication operation every clock cycle. This is critical for maximizing DSP utilization, as each DSP can be kept busy continuously.\n\nThe dataflow pragma is applied to overlap memory transfers with computation, reducing idle time. This is especially important for the VCK5000 which has significant memory bandwidth and computational resources that must be balanced efficiently.\n\nFor memory interfaces, we use m_axi for the large input/output matrices, mapping them to separate memory bundles (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2) to avoid memory access conflicts. The s_axilite interface enables CPU control of the accelerator.\n\nBoundary conditions are carefully handled to ensure correct operation when processing edge tiles where the computation might extend beyond the actual matrix dimensions.'), results=Results(parameters='The implementation achieves maximum DSP utilization through the following strategies:\n\n1. Tiling Parameters: TM=TN=TK=128 provides a balance between on-chip memory utilization and computational efficiency\n\n2. Array Partitioning: localA partitioned in dimension 2, localB partitioned in dimension 1, and localC fully partitioned enables parallel access patterns that match the DSP architecture\n\n3. Loop Pipelining: II=1 on the innermost computation loop ensures DSPs are utilized every clock cycle\n\n4. Interface Configuration: Separate memory bundles (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2) for A, B, and C matrices prevent memory access bottlenecks\n\nThe theoretical computational throughput of this design is approximately 128 floating-point operations per clock cycle (multiple rows/columns processed in parallel due to partitioning), which approaches the maximum DSP utilization possible on the VCK5000 given the constraints.'), discussion_conclusion=Discussion_Conclusion(discussion='The implemented design makes several trade-offs to achieve high performance. The tile size of 128×128 was chosen to balance on-chip memory usage with computational efficiency. Larger tiles would increase data reuse but exceed BRAM capacity, while smaller tiles would reduce the opportunity for parallelism.\n\nThe array partitioning strategy focuses on the access patterns in the innermost loop, where localA and localB partitioning enables parallel multiply-accumulate operations. Complete partitioning of localC ensures no write conflicts slow down the computation.\n\nOne limitation is that the dataflow optimization could potentially be improved with a more fine-grained approach, creating a streaming architecture between the load, compute, and store operations. However, this would significantly increase design complexity and might not be well-supported by the HLS tools.\n\nThe boundary condition checking adds some overhead, but is necessary to handle edge cases correctly. An alternative approach could pre-pad the matrices to be exact multiples of the tile size, eliminating runtime checks but increasing memory usage.', conclusion='The tiled matrix multiplication implementation successfully addresses the computational requirements for large-scale GEMM operations on the VCK5000 FPGA. By leveraging HLS directives for array partitioning, loop pipelining, and memory interface optimization, the design achieves high DSP utilization while maintaining manageable on-chip memory requirements.\n\nThe key insight from this design process is that effective FPGA acceleration of matrix operations depends critically on the balance between computation and memory bandwidth. The tiling approach with carefully chosen dimensions (128×128) enables this balance by bringing workable data chunks on-chip, maximizing reuse, and ensuring the DSP units remain busy.\n\nThis implementation demonstrates that with proper optimization techniques, HLS can generate efficient hardware for computationally intensive operations like GEMM. The approach can be extended to other linear algebra operations and could serve as a building block for more complex algorithms implemented on FPGAs, such as deep neural networks that rely heavily on matrix operations.')), config=ConfigFile(ops_num=1024.0, parameters=Parameters(board_name=5000.0, max_DSP=9024.0, max_FF=2607360.0, max_LUT=1303680.0, optimal_DSP=4096.0, optimal_FF=983040.0, optimal_LUT=491520.0, m_size=1024.0, n_size=1024.0, k_size=1024.0), hls_design='#include "hls_stream.h"\n#include "ap_int.h"\n#include "ap_axi_sdata.h"\n\n#define M_SIZE 1024\n#define K_SIZE 1024\n#define N_SIZE 1024\n\n#define TM 128\n#define TK 128\n#define TN 128\n\nvoid gemm(float A[M_SIZE][K_SIZE], float B[K_SIZE][N_SIZE], float C[M_SIZE][N_SIZE]) {\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=A offset=slave bundle=gmem0 depth=M_SIZE*K_SIZE\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=B offset=slave bundle=gmem1 depth=K_SIZE*N_SIZE\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=C offset=slave bundle=gmem2 depth=M_SIZE*N_SIZE\n    \n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=A bundle=control\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=B bundle=control\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=C bundle=control\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=return bundle=control\n\n    // Tiled matrix multiplication\n    for (int i_t = 0; i_t < M_SIZE; i_t += TM) {\n        for (int j_t = 0; j_t < N_SIZE; j_t += TN) {\n            // Initialize result tile\n            float localC[TM][TN];\n            #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localC complete dim=0\n            \n            // Initialize localC\n            for (int i = 0; i < TM; i++) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < TN; j++) {\n                    #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\n                    localC[i][j] = 0.0f;\n                }\n            }\n            \n            // Loop over tiles in K dimension\n            for (int k_t = 0; k_t < K_SIZE; k_t += TK) {\n                #pragma HLS DATAFLOW\n                \n                // Local buffers for A and B tiles\n                float localA[TM][TK];\n                #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localA complete dim=2\n                \n                float localB[TK][TN];\n                #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localB complete dim=1\n                \n                // Load tile of A into local memory\n                for (int i = 0; i < TM; i++) {\n                    for (int k = 0; k < TK; k++) {\n                        #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\n                        if (i_t + i < M_SIZE && k_t + k < K_SIZE)\n                            localA[i][k] = A[i_t + i][k_t + k];\n                        else\n                            localA[i][k] = 0.0f;\n                    }\n                }\n                \n                // Load tile of B into local memory\n                for (int k = 0; k < TK; k++) {\n                    for (int j = 0; j < TN; j++) {\n                        #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\n                        if (k_t + k < K_SIZE && j_t + j < N_SIZE)\n                            localB[k][j] = B[k_t + k][j_t + j];\n                        else\n                            localB[k][j] = 0.0f;\n                    }\n                }\n                \n                // Compute matrix multiplication for this tile\n                for (int i = 0; i < TM; i++) {\n                    for (int j = 0; j < TN; j++) {\n                        float sum = 0.0f;\n                        \n                        // Compute one element of the result\n                        for (int k = 0; k < TK; k++) {\n                            #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\n                            sum += localA[i][k] * localB[k][j];\n                        }\n                        \n                        localC[i][j] += sum;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            \n            // Store result back to global memory\n            for (int i = 0; i < TM; i++) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < TN; j++) {\n                    #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\n                    if (i_t + i < M_SIZE && j_t + j < N_SIZE)\n                        C[i_t + i][j_t + j] = localC[i][j];\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': 'Simulation failed', 'score': 0}
