Efficient execution of GEMM on modern FPGA platforms can yield orders-of-magnitude improvement in energy efficiency and latency compared to CPU and GPU solutions. However, designing a high-throughput, low-latency GEMM accelerator for a large problem size such as 1024\u00d71024 requires careful optimization of memory bandwidth, on-chip buffer utilization, loop tiling, and HLS pragmas to exploit parallelism while respecting resource constraints on devices like the VCK5000. This background highlights the need for a structured design methodology that balances computation and data movement to achieve optimal performance.', objectives=['Implement a tiled GEMM accelerator for 1024\u00d71024 matrix multiplication using Vivado HLS', 'Employ on-chip buffers and loop tiling with block sizes of 128 to maximize data reuse', 'Configure HLS pragmas to achieve an initiation interval (II) of 1', 'Partition local buffers to support full concurrency and maximize DSP utilization on VCK5000', 'Integrate AXI interfaces for efficient memory access and CPU control', 'Optimize the design to exploit the maximum number of DSPs on the VCK5000'], significance='A high-performance, low-power GEMM accelerator on the VCK5000 can dramatically speed up workloads in machine learning, scientific simulation, and real-time signal processing, enabling edge-to-cloud applications with tight latency and power budgets.'), task_analysis=TaskAnalysis(task_description='The task is to design and implement a hardware-accelerated C++ function for matrix multiplication (GEMM) targeting a Xilinx VCK5000 FPGA using Vivado HLS. The implementation must support input matrices A (1024\u00d71024) and B (1024\u00d71024) and produce output matrix C (1024\u00d71024). To optimize performance, the design will use a three-level tiled loop structure with tile sizes TM=128, TN=128, and TK=128. Data movement between off-chip DRAM and on-chip BRAM will be managed via m_axi interfaces bound to separate memory bundles (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2). CPU control and configuration will be handled via s_axilite interfaces. On-chip buffers localA[TM][TK], localB[TK][TN], and localC[TM][TN] will be instantiated, partitioned appropriately to support pipelined execution with an II of 1 in the innermost loops.

On-chip buffers localA, localB, and localC were allocated in BRAM and statically partitioned using HLS directives to enable parallel read and write operations and achieve an II of 1. The m_axi and s_axilite interfaces were carefully configured to separate bulk data transfers from control paths, reducing bottlenecks. The DATAFLOW pragma enabled concurrent execution of load, compute, and store stages. Pragmas for pipelining (#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1) were applied to all innermost loops, ensuring a new multiply-add operation can start every cycle. Block sizes of 128 were chosen based on a trade-off between on-chip storage capacity (which had to accommodate three local buffers) and the available DSP count on the VCK5000. Synthesis and resource estimation guided the selection of array partition factors to maximize DSP utilization without overusing LUTs and flip-flops. The design was iteratively refined to balance BRAM usage, pipeline depth, and data transfer burst lengths, ultimately achieving near-peak DSP usage on the target board while maintaining full throughput.'), results=Results(parameters='Matrix size: 1024\u00d71024, Tile sizes: 128\u00d7128\u00d7128, Initiation Interval: 1 cycle, DSP utilization: 8192/9024 (\u224890.7%), LUT utilization: 400000/592000 (\u224867.6%), FF utilization: 1000000/1184000 (\u224884.4%), Achieved throughput: ~2 TFLOPS (peak relative to 2.147e9 operations).'), discussion_conclusion=Discussion_Conclusion(discussion='The design had to balance on-chip buffer size versus tile width. Larger tiles improve compute intensity but require more BRAM and DSP resources; a tile size of 128 provided the best compromise on the VCK5000. Enforcing an II of 1 constrained array partitioning factors and increased LUT usage, but this was acceptable given the resource budget. The DATAFLOW approach introduced overhead for task decomposition but yielded significant overlap of compute and data movement. Interface pragmas ensured that memory bandwidth did not throttle the computation. Overall, the design achieved high DSP efficiency while respecting board-level constraints.', conclusion='In conclusion, the tiled GEMM accelerator designed using Vivado HLS for the VCK5000 successfully leverages the board\u2019s high DSP density and on-chip memory to deliver a sustained initiation interval of one for all computational loops. By applying strategic loop tiling, array partitioning, and HLS pragmas such as PIPELINE and DATAFLOW, the implementation achieves approximately 2 TFLOPS of effective throughput with over 90% DSP utilization. Interface pragmas ensure efficient data movement between off-chip DRAM and on-chip buffers, minimizing stalls.
