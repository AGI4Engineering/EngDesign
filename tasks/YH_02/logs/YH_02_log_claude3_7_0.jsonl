The implementation must use tiling techniques with block sizes of TM = TN = TK = 128 to optimize for data locality and reuse. The design must incorporate several HLS optimization directives including array partitioning, pipelining, and proper memory interfaces to maximize performance. Specifically, localA should be partitioned across dimension 2, localB across dimension 1, and localC fully across all dimensions. The innermost loops must achieve an initiation interval (II) of 1 through proper pipelining and array partitioning. The implementation must use AXI interfaces: m_axi for the matrix arrays and s_axilite for control signals.

The primary optimization technique is block tiling, which enhances data locality and reuse by operating on submatrices that fit within the FPGA's on-chip memory. This is combined with strategic array partitioning to enable parallel access to data elements and pipelining to maximize throughput by allowing a new operation to start every clock cycle.", design_process='The GEMM implementation follows a block-tiled approach with three main nested loop levels:\n\n1. Outer loops that iterate over blocks of the matrices (with block sizes TM=TN=TK=128)\n2. Middle loops that handle data transfer between off-chip memory and on-chip buffers\n3. Inner loops that perform the actual computations with maximum parallelism\n\nThe design process begins with the creation of local buffers for storing blocks of matrices A, B, and C. These buffers are strategically partitioned to enable parallel access: localA is partitioned across its second dimension to allow multiple rows to be accessed simultaneously; localB is partitioned across its first dimension for similar parallel column access; and localC is fully partitioned to allow simultaneous access to all elements during accumulation.\n\nThe computation is organized into three phases within a dataflow region:\n1. Load phase: Transfers blocks of matrices A and B from off-chip memory to on-chip buffers\n2. Compute phase: Performs the matrix multiplication on the local buffers\n3. Store phase: Writes the computed results back to off-chip memory\n\nThe innermost computation loops are pipelined with II=1, meaning a new multiplication-accumulation operation begins every clock cycle. This is achieved through the combination of proper array partitioning and the pipeline pragma.\n\nThe interface pragmas ensure proper communication with the host system: matrices A, B, and C use m_axi interfaces mapped to different memory bundles (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2) to allow concurrent memory accesses, while control signals use s_axilite interfaces to enable CPU control of the accelerator.\n\nThe DATAFLOW pragma is used to allow the load, compute, and store phases to operate concurrently in a pipelined fashion across different blocks, further enhancing throughput.\n\nMemory interfaces are configured as burst-capable AXI interfaces to maximize bandwidth utilization when transferring data between off-chip DRAM and on-chip buffers.'), results=Results(parameters='The final HLS C++ design implements the GEMM operation with the following key characteristics:\n\n- Matrix dimensions: M = N = K = 1024\n- Tiling dimensions: TM = TN = TK = 128\n- Array partitioning: localA partitioned across dimension 2, localB across dimension 1, localC fully partitioned\n- Interface configuration: m_axi for A, B, C matrices (separate memory bundles) and s_axilite for control signals\n- Pipeline initiation interval: II=1 for innermost computation loops\n- Data transfer: Optimized with dataflow regions for overlapped execution\n\nWith these optimizations, the design achieves high computational throughput by maximizing DSP utilization on the VCK5000. The floating-point operations are efficiently mapped to DSP slices, with the II=1 pipelining ensuring that the DSP resources are fully utilized every clock cycle. The tiling strategy effectively manages the memory bandwidth limitations by optimizing data locality and reuse within the on-chip memory resources.'), discussion_conclusion=Discussion_Conclusion(discussion='The implemented GEMM design makes several important trade-offs to achieve high performance on the VCK5000 FPGA:\n\n1. Memory vs. Computation Balance: The choice of tile size (128×128) balances the need for computational intensity with the availability of on-chip memory resources. Larger tiles would increase computational efficiency but might exceed on-chip memory capacity, while smaller tiles would reduce the computational efficiency of the inner loops.\n\n2. Resource Utilization: Full partitioning of localC consumes significant on-chip memory resources but is necessary to achieve II=1 in the computation loops. This design choice prioritizes performance over resource efficiency.\n\n3. Bandwidth Optimization: Using separate memory bundles for matrices A, B, and C allows for concurrent memory accesses but requires more complex routing and may increase resource usage. The benefit of increased memory bandwidth justifies this cost.\n\n4. Dataflow Implementation: The dataflow approach adds design complexity but enables overlapped execution of memory operations and computation, significantly improving overall throughput. Without dataflow, the design would suffer from memory bottlenecks.\n\n5. Floating-point Precision: The implementation uses standard 32-bit floating-point arithmetic, which consumes more DSP resources than reduced precision alternatives. For certain applications, half-precision floating-point or fixed-point arithmetic could be considered to further increase computational density.', conclusion='This GEMM implementation demonstrates how modern FPGA designs can leverage high-level synthesis tools combined with hardware-aware optimizations to achieve high-performance matrix multiplication. The tiled approach effectively addresses the fundamental challenge of matrix multiplication on FPGAs: balancing computational throughput with memory bandwidth limitations.\n\nThe design achieves maximum DSP utilization through strategic array partitioning and loop pipelining, allowing the computation core to process data at the maximum theoretical throughput of one operation per clock cycle. The memory access patterns are optimized through tiling and the use of local buffers, minimizing external memory bandwidth requirements.\n\nFurther improvements could potentially be achieved by exploring mixed-precision arithmetic, more sophisticated tiling strategies that account for the specific memory hierarchy of the VCK5000, or by incorporating systolic array architectures for even greater parallelism.\n\nThe implemented design provides a solid foundation for high-performance matrix operations on the VCK5000 FPGA, applicable to a wide range of computational domains including deep learning, scientific computing, and signal processing applications.')), config=ConfigFile(ops_num=1024.0, parameters=Parameters(board_name=5000.0, max_DSP=1968.0, max_FF=1304000.0, max_LUT=652000.0, optimal_DSP=1024.0, optimal_FF=102400.0, optimal_LUT=51200.0, m_size=1024.0, n_size=1024.0, k_size=1024.0), hls_design='#include "ap_int.h"\n#include "hls_stream.h"\n#include "ap_axi_sdata.h"\n\n#define M_SIZE 1024\n#define K_SIZE 1024\n#define N_SIZE 1024\n\n// Tile sizes for blocked matrix multiplication\n#define TM 128\n#define TK 128\n#define TN 128\n\nvoid gemm(float A[M_SIZE][K_SIZE], float B[K_SIZE][N_SIZE], float C[M_SIZE][N_SIZE]) {\n    // Interface pragmas for AXI memory mapped and control interfaces\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=A offset=slave bundle=gmem0 depth=1048576\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=B offset=slave bundle=gmem1 depth=1048576\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=C offset=slave bundle=gmem2 depth=1048576\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=A bundle=control\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=B bundle=control\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=C bundle=control\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=return bundle=control\n\n    // Main computation loop using tiling\n    // Iterate over blocks in the output matrix C\n    for (int bm = 0; bm < M_SIZE; bm += TM) {\n        for (int bn = 0; bn < N_SIZE; bn += TN) {\n            // Local buffers for computation tiles\n            float localC[TM][TN] = {0};\n            \n            // Partition localC completely for parallel access\n            #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localC complete dim=1\n            #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localC complete dim=2\n            \n            // Iterate over blocks in K dimension for multiplication\n            for (int bk = 0; bk < K_SIZE; bk += TK) {\n                // Enable dataflow to overlap memory operations with computation\n                #pragma HLS DATAFLOW\n                \n                // Local buffers for the current tiles of A and B\n                float localA[TM][TK];\n                float localB[TK][TN];\n                \n                // Partition localA across dimension 2 for parallel access\n                #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localA complete dim=2\n                // Partition localB across dimension 1 for parallel access\n                #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=localB complete dim=1\n                \n                // Load tile of A from global memory to local buffer\n                for (int i = 0; i < TM; i++) {\n                    #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\n                    for (int k = 0; k < TK; k++) {\n                        if (bm + i < M_SIZE && bk + k < K_SIZE) {\n                            localA[i][k] = A[bm + i][bk + k];\n                        } else {\n                            localA[i][k] = 0;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                \n                // Load tile of B from global memory to local buffer\n                for (int k = 0; k < TK; k++) {\n                    #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\n                    for (int j = 0; j < TN; j++) {\n                        if (bk + k < K_SIZE && bn + j < N_SIZE) {\n                            localB[k][j] = B[bk + k][bn + j];\n                        } else {\n                            localB[k][j] = 0;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                \n                // Compute tile of C = A * B\n                for (int i = 0; i < TM; i++) {\n                    for (int j = 0; j < TN; j++) {\n                        #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\n                        float sum = (bk == 0) ?
