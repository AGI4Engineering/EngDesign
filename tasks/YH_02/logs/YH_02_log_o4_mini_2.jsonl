Historically, optimizing GEMM on CPUs and GPUs has driven architectural innovations in SIMD units and memory hierarchies. FPGAs have emerged as an energy-efficient alternative, allowing custom datapaths and deep pipelining to accelerate GEMM with fine-grained control. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) bridges software productivity and hardware performance by letting designers express parallelism and data reuse explicitly in C/C++. In this context, efficient tiling, streaming, and interface pragmas can maximize throughput and resource utilization on state-of-the-art boards like the Xilinx VCK5000.', objectives=['Implement a tiled GEMM with II=1 in Vivado HLS', 'Maximize on-chip data reuse and minimize off-chip bandwidth', 'Exploit array partitioning to achieve full pipeline parallelism', 'Map AXI interfaces for seamless host control and DMA'], significance='A highly optimized GEMM accelerator on FPGAs can deliver teraflops of sustained performance at a fraction of the power consumption of traditional processors, enabling real-time inference in edge and data-center applications.'), task_analysis=TaskAnalysis(task_description='The user requests a Vivado HLS compatible C++ function for GEMM (C = A*B) with matrices of size 1024\u00d71024 and tiling parameters TM = TN = TK = 128. The design must include AXI master interfaces for the three matrices, AXI-Lite control ports, and a DATAFLOW region to overlap memory transfer and computation. On-chip buffers localA, localB, and localC must be partitioned to support an initiation interval (II) of 1 in the deepest loop nests. The solution must use PIPELINE pragmas but avoid manual UNROLL directives, relying instead on effective array partitioning.

Static local buffers localA[TM][TK], localB[TK][TN], and localC[TM][TN] are declared, with complete partitioning on appropriate dimensions to enable parallel accesses. The top-level function gemm is annotated with m_axi interfaces for data arrays and s_axilite for control, and a DATAFLOW pragma is inserted to allow concurrent load, compute, and store tasks. The triple-nested loops over tiles (mm, nn, kk) handle data movement: loading subblocks of A and B into local buffers, computing partial inner products with an II=1 pipeline on the innermost accumulation, and writing the results back to C. PIPELINE pragmas on the i\u2013j loops guarantee one result per cycle, and partitioning ensures no memory access conflicts.
