Key HLS optimization techniques include pipelining, array partitioning, and dataflow programming. The design prioritizes maximizing parallelism in the computation while adhering to specific pragma usage constraints, particularly the avoidance of manual unroll pragmas.', design_process=\"The GEMM operation C(M,N) = A(M,K) * B(K,N) is implemented using three levels of nested loops for tiling: `i0` over M (stride TM), `j0` over N (stride TN), and `k0` over K (stride TK).\\n1. Local Buffers: Within the `(i0, j0)` tile iteration, a local buffer `localC_accumulator[TM][TN]` is used to store the partial sums for the C-tile. This buffer is initialized to zero before the `k0` loop begins. For each `k0` iteration, tiles from A (`localA[TM][TK]`) and B (`localB[TK][TN]`) are loaded from global memory.\\n2. Array Partitioning: `localA` is partitioned completely along its second dimension (TK), `localB` completely along its first dimension (TK), and `localC_accumulator` completely along all dimensions. This partitioning allows parallel access to data elements required for computation. Specifically, complete partitioning of `localA` on dim 2 makes all `TK` elements of a row `localA[it][0...TK-1]` available simultaneously. Similarly for `localB`, making `localB[0...TK-1][jt]` available. Full partitioning of `localC_accumulator` makes each element `localC_accumulator[it][jt]` an independent register.\\n3. Computation Pipelining: The computation for a C-tile involves accumulating products `localA[it][kt] * localB[kt][jt]`. The loops iterating over `it` (0 to TM-1) and `jt` (0 to TN-1) perform this. The `jt` loop (or the combined `it,jt` processing element) is pipelined with an Initiation Interval (II) of 1. Due to this pipelining and the specified array partitioning for `localA` and `localB`, the innermost loop over `kt` (0 to TK-1) is expected to be automatically unrolled by HLS. This means that for each cycle in the pipelined `jt` loop, `TK` multiplications and additions (forming a dot product of length `TK`) are performed. This uses `TK` DSP units.\\n4. Dataflow: The `#pragma HLS DATAFLOW` is applied to the main `gemm` function, enabling HLS to create concurrent processes for reading A-tiles, reading B-tiles, and computing/writing C-tiles, potentially overlapping these operations across different `k0` tile iterations or `i0,j0` tile iterations depending on stream usage and buffering inferred/specified.\\n5. Interface Specification: `m_axi` interfaces are used for `A`, `B`, and `C` arrays, bundled to `gmem0`, `gmem1`, and `gmem2` respectively to enable parallel memory access. `s_axilite` interfaces cover control signals and base addresses for `A`, `B`, `C`.\\n6. DSP Maximization Strategy: The primary way to increase DSP usage with the described pipelining (unrolling `kt` loop) is to process multiple `(it,jt)` elements in parallel. Without manual `HLS UNROLL` on `it` or `jt` loops, the design relies on HLS's automatic behavior. The described structure achieves `TK` (128) DSPs. To maximize DSPs further towards the VCK5000's 1968 DSPs, one would typically unroll the `jt` loop by a factor `P_J` (e.g., `P_J=15` for `15*128=1920` DSPs). This aspect is discussed under 'Discussion' due to the 'no manual unroll' constraint. The target optimal DSP is set to 1920 in config parameters, while the code will achieve 128.\"), results=Results(parameters='{\"Target Board\": \"VCK5000\", \"Matrix Dimensions (M,N,K)\": \"1024,1024,1024\", \"Tile Dimensions (TM,TN,TK)\": \"128,128,128\", \"Achieved DSPs (due to no manual unroll constraint)\": 128, \"Estimated LUTs for 128 DSP configuration\": \"~65,000\", \"Estimated FFs for 128 DSP configuration\": \"~65,000\", \"Pipeline II for compute tile element\": 1, \"Unrolled loop for dot product (implicit)\": \"TK dimension (128 operations)\"}'), discussion_conclusion=Discussion_Conclusion(discussion=\"The design adheres to the specified constraints, particularly the use of tiling, local buffers, specific HLS pragmas, and the prohibition of manual `#pragma HLS UNROLL`. The interpretation of 'PIPELINE II=1 on inner loops' combined with array partitioning leads to the `kt` loop being unrolled, resulting in `TK=128` DSPs. This is a substantial amount of parallelism for computing each element of the `localC` tile.\\n\\nCost vs Performance/Resource Utilization: The VCK5000 offers 1,968 DSPs. The current design achieves 128 DSPs. The requirement to 'maximize DSPs' typically involves unrolling the loops that iterate over tile elements (`it`, `jt`) to instantiate multiple `TK`-DSP compute units in parallel. For example, unrolling the `jt` loop by a factor `P_J = 15` would yield `15 * 128 = 1920` DSPs, effectively utilizing most available DSPs. However, the 'no manual UNROLL' constraint prevents explicitly specifying `UNROLL factor=15`. While HLS might perform some automatic unrolling under certain conditions, achieving a precise, maximized DSP count without explicit directives is challenging. The current design represents a baseline compliant with all rules.\\n\\nDataflow Implementation: The `#pragma HLS DATAFLOW` directive allows for task-level parallelism. For optimal performance, this usually requires careful structuring of the code into distinct producer/consumer functions communicating via `hls::stream` objects, often with explicit ping-pong buffering. The provided C code uses a simplified structure where dataflow processes would be inferred by HLS on major loop structures or function calls within the tiled algorithm.\\n\\nArray Partitioning and II=1: The chosen partitioning scheme (`localA` on dim 2, `localB` on dim 1, `localC` fully) directly supports the unrolling of the `kt` loop when the `jt` loop (processing elements of `localC`) is pipelined with II=1. This is a standard and effective HLS optimization pattern.\", conclusion=\"This design outlines a tiled matrix multiplication accelerator for the VCK5000 FPGA using Vivado HLS, conforming to all specified constraints including matrix/tile sizes and HLS pragma usage. The interpretation of pipelining and automatic unrolling due to partitioning results in a design utilizing `TK=128` DSPs for the core computation of each tile element. While this is a significant level of parallelism, achieving maximal DSP utilization (approaching the VCK5000's full capacity) under the 'no manual UNROLL' constraint is inherently limited; such maximization typically requires explicit unrolling factors for spatial replication of compute units. The provided solution establishes a robust, compliant baseline. Further exploration into HLS tool options for implicit parallelism or synthesis strategies might be needed to push DSP usage higher without manual unroll pragmas. The design successfully demonstrates the application of common HLS optimization techniques for a compute-intensive kernel.\")) config=ConfigFile(ops_num=2147483648.0, parameters=Parameters(board_name=5000.0, max_DSP=1968.0, max_FF=2362000.0, max_LUT=1181000.0, optimal_DSP=1920.0, optimal_FF=960000.0, optimal_LUT=960000.0, m_size=1024.0, n_size=1024.0, k_size=1024.0), hls_design='#include \"hls_stream.h\"\\n#include \"ap_int.h\"\\n#include \"ap_axi_sdata.h\"\\n\\n#define M_SIZE 1024\\n#define N_SIZE 1024\\n#define K_SIZE 1024\\n#define TM 128\\n#define TN 128\\n#define TK 128\\n\\n// Define a structure for streaming tiles if a more complex dataflow is used.\\n// For simplicity, this example will use local arrays and assume HLS manages dataflow buffering.\\n\\nvoid load_A_tile(float A_port[M_SIZE][K_SIZE], int i0, int k0, float localA[TM][TK]) {\\n    // Reads a TMxTK tile from A_port into localA\\n    load_A_row: for (int i = 0; i < TM; ++i) {\\n        load_A_col: for (int k = 0; k < TK; ++k) {\\n            #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\\n            localA[i][k] = A_port[i0 + i][k0 + k];\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nvoid load_B_tile(float B_port[K_SIZE][N_SIZE], int k0, int j0, float localB[TK][TN]) {\\n    // Reads a TKxTN tile from B_port into localB\\n    load_B_row: for (int k = 0; k < TK; ++k) {\\n        load_B_col: for (int j = 0; j < TN; ++j) {\\n            #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\\n            localB[k][j] = B_port[k0 + k][j0 + j];\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nvoid compute_tile(float localA[TM][TK], float localB[TK][TN], float localC_accum[TM][TN], bool first_k_tile) {\\n    // Computes localC_accum += localA * localB\\n    // (or localC_accum = localA * localB if first_k_tile is true)\\n    comp_row: for (int it = 0; it < TM; ++it) {\\n        comp_col: for (int jt = 0; jt < TN; ++jt) {\\n            #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1 // This pipeline directive enables II=1 for producing one C_tile element.\\n                                    // The kt_loop below is expected to be unrolled by HLS.\\n            float sum = first_k_tile ? 0.0f : localC_accum[it][jt];\\n            comp_dot: for (int kt = 0; kt < TK; ++kt) {\\n                // #pragma HLS UNROLL // Implicitly unrolled due to PIPELINE on parent and array partitions\\n                sum += localA[it][kt] * localB[kt][jt];\\n            }\\n            localC_accum[it][jt] = sum;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nvoid store_C_tile(float localC_accum[TM][TN], float C_port[M_SIZE][N_SIZE], int i0, int j0) {\\n    // Writes the TMxTN tile from localC_accum to C_port\\n    store_C_row: for (int i = 0; i < TM; ++i) {\\n        store_C_col: for (int j = 0; j < TN; ++j) {\\n            #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1\\n            C_port[i0 + i][j0 + j] = localC_accum[i][j];\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nextern \"C\" {\\nvoid gemm(\\n    float A[M_SIZE][K_SIZE],\\n    float B[K_SIZE][N_SIZE],\\n    float C[M_SIZE][N_SIZE]\\n) {\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=A offset=slave bundle=gmem0 depth=1048576 // M_SIZE*K_SIZE = 1024*1024\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=B offset=slave bundle=gmem1 depth=1048576 // K_SIZE*N_SIZE = 1024*1024\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=C offset=slave bundle=gmem2 depth=1048576 // M_SIZE*N_SIZE = 1024*1024\\n\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=A bundle=control\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=B bundle=control\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=C bundle=control\\n    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=return bundle=control\\n\\n    #pragma HLS DATAFLOW\\n\\n    // Local buffers for tiles.
