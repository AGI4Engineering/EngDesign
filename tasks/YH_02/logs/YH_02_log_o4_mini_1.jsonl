Historically, hand\u2010optimized CPU and GPU implementations have dominated, but as FPGA devices have matured, High\u2010Level Synthesis (HLS) makes it possible to express compute\u2010intensive kernels in C/C++ and synthesize highly parallel FPGA accelerators. The challenge lies in structuring code so that data movement, on\u2010chip buffering, and pipelining extract maximum performance while respecting device resource constraints.', objectives=['Implement a 1024\u00d71024\u00d71024 GEMM in Vivado HLS', 'Use 128\u00d7128\u00d7128 tiling to maximize data reuse', 'Achieve II=1 through array partitioning and pipelining', 'Interface via AXI\u2010lite and AXI\u2010memory for host control and bulk data transfer', 'Optimize DSP usage for the VCK5000 FPGA'], significance='A highly optimized FPGA GEMM unlocks low\u2010latency, energy\u2010efficient linear algebra building blocks critical for scientific computing, real\u2010time signal processing, and on\u2010chip AI inference in data centers and edge devices.'), task_analysis=TaskAnalysis(task_description='The user requires a Vivado HLS C++ function gemm that multiplies two floating\u2010point matrices A (1024\u00d71024) and B (1024\u00d71024) to produce C (1024\u00d71024). The design must use 128\u00d7128\u00d7128 tiling, on\u2010chip buffers localA, localB, localC, array partitioning (dim2 for localA, dim1 for localB, fully for localC), and #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1 in innermost loops. AXI\u2010memory interfaces (m_axi) on A, B, C should map to gmem0, gmem1, gmem2; control ports via s_axilite; a DATAFLOW region should overlap memory and compute.

Fully partitioning localC insured an II of 1 but increased LUT usage; partitioning only one dimension of localA/localB reduced routing complexity while preserving pipelining.
