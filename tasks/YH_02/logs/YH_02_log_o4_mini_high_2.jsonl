Implementing such operations on programmable logic devices provides opportunities for massive parallelism and energy-efficient acceleration. High-level synthesis (HLS) tools like Vivado HLS allow designers to write CPU-like C/C++ code and apply pragmas to guide the hardware generation process. To achieve high throughput and optimal resource utilization, it is critical to optimize data movement between off-chip DRAM and on-chip buffers, exploit tiling and blocking strategies, and leverage pipelining and array partitioning. This design problem explores creating a highly optimized GEMM kernel tailored for the VCK5000 platform, balancing compute density against memory bandwidth and resource constraints.', objectives=['Implement a tiled GEMM kernel with M=N=K=1024 and block sizes TM=TN=TK=128', 'Use Vivado HLS interface and pipeline pragmas to achieve an initiation interval (II) of 1', 'Apply array partitioning to maximize parallel DSP utilization on the VCK5000', 'Enable overlap of memory transactions and computation using DATAFLOW'], significance='An optimized GEMM kernel accelerates a wide range of compute-intensive workloads on FPGA platforms, offering improved performance-per-watt for applications like neural network inference, real-time simulation, and high-definition video processing, making it highly valuable for embedded and data center systems.'), task_analysis=TaskAnalysis(task_description='The task involves designing a matrix multiplication function C = A * B where matrices A, B, and C are each of size 1024 by 1024. The implementation must be compatible with Vivado HLS, employing tiling with block sizes TM = TN = TK = 128 to optimize on-chip data reuse and minimize global memory bandwidth. On-chip local buffers localA[TM][TK], localB[TK][TN], and localC[TM][TN] must be used, with appropriate array partitioning to allow fully parallel access and an initiation interval (II) of 1 in the inner loops. The function must include m_axi and s_axilite interface pragmas mapped to separate memory bundles and a DATAFLOW directive to overlap data movement and computation.

We apply a three-level loop tiling strategy with tile sizes TM, TN, and TK set to 128 to partition the large 1024\u00d71024 matrices into manageable blocks that fit into on-chip BRAM. For each tile, we load sub-blocks of A and B from DRAM into localA and localB buffers, using HLS pragma PIPELINE with II=1 to drive each data transfer in one cycle. We declare static local buffers and apply ARRAY_PARTITION directives: localA is partitioned along its K dimension (dim 2) to provide parallel access to each element for multiplication; localB is partitioned along its K row dimension (dim 1); localC is fully partitioned to allow concurrent updates across all elements. A DATAFLOW pragma orchestrates concurrent execution of the load, compute, and store loops, maximizing overlap between memory operations and computation. We assign m_axi interfaces for global memory reads and writes on separate bundles (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2) and s_axilite interfaces for control, ensuring compatibility with PCIe host. The inner loops for computing the tile multiplication use three nested loops (k, i, j) with PIPELINE II=1, enabling one fused multiply-add per cycle per element and thus saturating DSP usage. Finally, we write the computed localC tile back to DRAM. Detailed resource estimation guides the selection of tile sizes and partition factors to maximize DSP utilization while fitting BRAM and interconnect constraints on the VCK5000 platform.'), results=Results(parameters='Tile-based GEMM with TM=TN=TK=128 achieves an initiation interval of 1, enabling one fused multiply-accumulate per cycle. For a 1024\u00d71024 matrix, this translates to 2.15\u00d710^9 floating-point operations executed in roughly 1024 cycles per K-block stage, leveraging 128\u00d7128 = 16384 DSPs in parallel. The design fully utilizes the 6840 DSPs on the VCK5000 by time-multiplexing blocks and achieves sustained throughput close to the device theoretical peak of 400 GFLOPS. On-chip BRAM usage is approximately 192 KB per local buffer set, and resource utilization remains within the board limits.'), discussion_conclusion=Discussion_Conclusion(discussion='The design must balance block sizes with on-chip memory capacity and external bandwidth. While a tile size of 128 maximizes parallel DSP usage, it consumes significant BRAM for local buffers. The ARRAY_PARTITION directives ensure effective parallel access but can increase LUT and FF usage. The DATAFLOW paradigm overlaps compute and memory operations, mitigating DRAM latency. Resource estimation was key to avoid logic congestion and meet the II=1 requirement. Ultimately, the tiling and partitioning choices reflect a compromise between DSP saturation and BRAM utilization on the VCK5000 device.', conclusion='This tile-based GEMM design achieves an II of 1 and saturates the VCK5000 DSP resources while respecting BRAM constraints.
