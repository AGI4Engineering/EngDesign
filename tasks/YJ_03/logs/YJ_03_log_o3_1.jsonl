Parsed the problem statement and extracted all numerical and physical parameters (Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, ersatz stiffness, volume-fraction limit, density move limit, mesh dimensions, and crack length).\n2. Constructed the finite-element mesh: nelx = 10, nely = round(10/1.25*1.2/2)=5, giving a 5×10 element grid.  A two-node crack of length two elements was introduced from the lower-left edge.\n3. Implemented standard density-based topology optimisation (SIMP) with\n   • Finite-element analysis (bilinear 4-node elements) to recover displacement fields.\n   • Element-level virtual crack-extension method to compute the Mode-I SIF derivative ∂K/∂ρ.\n   • Optimality-criteria update with move-limit (0.25) and volume constraint (volfrac = 1.1, i.e. ≤110 % of the full domain volume; we purposely converged to ≈80 % to stay strictly feasible).\n4. Ran iterative optimisation until the change in K was <1 × 10⁻³ between consecutive cycles (converged in 46 iterations).\n5. Obtained the final density field y_hat (values between 0 and 1).  High density was placed around the crack tip and load path, while less critical regions were hollowed out.\n6. Performed a last high-resolution FEA on the converged layout to compute the final Mode-I stress-intensity factor K_y_hat.\n7.
