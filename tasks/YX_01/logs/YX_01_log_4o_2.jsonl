Therefore, the coordinates of the four corners can be calculated as follows:\n\n- **Bottom Left**: Given as (-80, -30).\n- **Bottom Right**: Since the width is 120 meters, the x-coordinate of the bottom-right corner is -80 + 120 = 40. Therefore, the bottom-right corner is at (40, -30).\n- **Top Right**: The top-right corner is 100 meters above the bottom-right corner, so the y-coordinate is -30 + 100 = 70. Therefore, the top-right corner is at (40, 70).\n- **Top Left**: The top-left corner is directly above the bottom-left corner, so it is at (-80, 70).\n\n### Task 2: Path Planning with Hybrid A* from (32.5, 27.5, π) to (-15, 12, π/2)\n\n1. **State Space Bounds**: Set x from -100 to 100, y from -100 to 100, and θ from 0 to 2π.\n2. **Hybrid A* Algorithm**: Use the algorithm to compute a path considering the vehicle's nonholonomic constraints.\n3. **Vehicle Constraints**: Minimum turning radius is 8, and motion primitive length is 10.\n4. **Start Pose**: (32.5, 27.5, π)\n5. **Goal Pose**: (-15, 12, π/2)\n6. **Path Length Calculation**: Compute the path length using the Hybrid A* algorithm.\n7. **Error Estimation**: Estimate the absolute error in the path length.\n\n### Task 3: Path Planning with Hybrid A* from (30, -12, π) to (-26, 12, π/2)\n\n1. **State Space Bounds**: Same as Task 2.\n2. **Hybrid A* Algorithm**: Use the algorithm to compute a path considering the vehicle's nonholonomic constraints.\n3. **Vehicle Constraints**: Same as Task 2.\n4. **Start Pose**: (30, -12, π)\n5. **Goal Pose**: (-26, 12, π/2)\n6. **Path Length Calculation**: Compute the path length using the Hybrid A* algorithm.\n7. **Error Estimation**: Estimate the absolute error in the path length.", config=ConfigFile(Bottom_left=(-80, -30), Bottom_right=(40, -30), Top_right=(40, 70), Top_left=(-80, 70), task2_length=100.0, tol2=0.5, task3_length=120.0, tol3=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'detailed information': 'The coordinates of the vertex in the bottom-left corner of the costmap is correct.\nThe coordinates of the vertex in the bottom-right corner of the costmap is correct.\nThe coordinates of the vertex in the top-right corner of the costmap is correct.\nThe coordinates of the vertex in the top-left corner of the costmap is correct.\nThe total path length for Task 2 is wrong.\nThe total path length for Task 3 is wrong.\n', 'total_score': 20}, 'score': 20}
