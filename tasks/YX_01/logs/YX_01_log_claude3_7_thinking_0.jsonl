To account for:\n1. The necessary 90-degree turn (adding approximately π*8/2 = 12.57 units due to the turning radius)\n2. Additional maneuvers to navigate around obstacles\n3. Requirements for a smooth path satisfying the nonholonomic constraints\n\nI estimate the total path length to be approximately 80.00 units, with an expected absolute error of 5.00 units.\n\nTask 3: Hybrid A* path planning from (30, -12, π) to (-26, 12, π/2).\nUsing the same approach as Task 2:\n\nThe Euclidean distance is:\n√[(30-(-26))² + (-12-12)²] = √[(56)² + (24)²] ≈ 61 units\n\nAgain, accounting for the 90-degree orientation change and obstacle avoidance, I estimate the total path length to be approximately 95.00 units, with an expected absolute error of 5.00 units.", config=ConfigFile(Bottom_left=(-80, -30), Bottom_right=(40, -30), Top_right=(40, 70), Top_left=(-80, 70), task2_length=80.0, tol2=5.0, task3_length=95.0, tol3=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'detailed information': 'The coordinates of the vertex in the bottom-left corner of the costmap is correct.\nThe coordinates of the vertex in the bottom-right corner of the costmap is correct.\nThe coordinates of the vertex in the top-right corner of the costmap is correct.\nThe coordinates of the vertex in the top-left corner of the costmap is correct.\nThe total path length for Task 2 is wrong.\nThe total path length for Task 3 is wrong.\n', 'total_score': 20}, 'score': 20}
