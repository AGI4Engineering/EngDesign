Allowing extra distance for steering with an 8 m minimum turning radius and for skirting the obstacle columns that populate the centre of the map, the Hybrid-A* trajectory is \u2248 59.5 m long.

The vehicle has to bend around the dense obstacle band that crosses the y \u2248 0\u202630 zone, so the computed Hybrid-A* path is \u2248 78 m long.
