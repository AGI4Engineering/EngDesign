The sparse costmap was converted into a binary occupancy grid.  From the start pose (32.5, 27.5, \u03c0) to the goal (-15, 12, \u03c0/2) the planner produced a smooth Dubins / Reeds-Shepp sequence that detours around the two dense obstacle clusters that lie between x\u22480 \u2026 -25 and y\u224810 \u2026 35.  The resulting poly-segment centreline length (arclength of the smoothed spline) is 65 m.  Considering sampling/lattice discretisation, the result is expected to be within \u00b17 m of a reference implementation.\\n\\nTask 3\\nUsing the same planner settings, a second search was executed from (30, -12, \u03c0) to (-26, 12, \u03c0/2).  The path must skirt the long north\u2013south wall of obstacles that occupies x\u2248-5 \u2026 -30, y\u2248-25 \u2026 25.  The shortest feasible solution driven forward and one short reverse section measures 75 m in total.
