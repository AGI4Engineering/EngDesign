{'completion_tokens': 1088, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The task is to provide configuration parameters for MATLAB\'s `loopsyn` function to design a stabilizing controller for an aircraft system. These parameters are the numerator (`num`) and denominator (`den`) coefficients of the desired loop shape (`Gd`), and the `alpha` parameter.\n\nStep 1: Determine Numerator (`num`) and Denominator (`den`) for the Desired Loop Shape (`Gd`)\n\nThe problem specifies the following for the desired loop shape:\n- Crossover frequency of 8 rad/s.\n- Low gain at high frequencies for robustness.\n- High gain at low frequencies for performance.\n- An example transfer function `Gd(s) = 8/s` is suggested.\n\nLet\'s analyze the suggested `Gd(s) = 8/s`:\n- The crossover frequency (`w_c`) is where the magnitude `|Gd(jw_c)| = 1`. For `Gd(s) = 8/s`, `|Gd(jw)| = |8/(jw)| = 8/w`. Setting `8/w_c = 1` gives `w_c = 8` rad/s. This matches the requirement.\n- At low frequencies (e.g., `w -> 0`), the gain `8/w -> infinity`, which is desirable for performance (e.g., tracking, disturbance rejection).\n- At high frequencies (e.g., `w -> infinity`), the gain `8/w -> 0`, which is desirable for robustness (e.g., noise attenuation, stability with unmodeled dynamics).\n\nThe transfer function `Gd(s) = 8/s` is suitable. To represent this in terms of numerator and denominator polynomial coefficients:\n- Numerator polynomial: `8` (which is `8 * s^0`). The coefficient list is `[8.0]`.\n- Denominator polynomial: `s` (which is `1 * s^1 + 0 * s^0`). The coefficient list is `[1.0, 0.0]` (assuming coefficients are ordered from highest power of `s` to lowest).\n\nSo, `num = [8.0]` and `den = [1.0, 0.0]`.\n\nStep 2: Determine the Alpha Parameter (`alpha`)\n\nThe `loopsyn` function requires an `alpha` parameter, where `0 < alpha < 1`. This parameter balances performance (how well the achieved loop shape `G*K` matches the desired loop shape `Gd`) and robustness.\n- Performance is often measured by `gamma`. The problem states that `gamma` should be less than 1. Values of `gamma` near or below 1 indicate that `G*K` is close to `Gd`.\n- Robustness is indicated by measures like disk margin. The problem requires the closed-loop system to achieve at least a 0.05 disk margin.\n\nA smaller `alpha` (closer to 0) typically prioritizes robustness, potentially leading to a larger `gamma` (poorer performance matching).\nA larger `alpha` (closer to 1) typically prioritizes performance matching (smaller `gamma`), potentially leading to reduced robustness (smaller disk margin).\n\nThe task is to provide an `alpha` value as input to `loopsyn`. The problem states that "Your design must ensure" the specified disk margin and `gamma` criteria are met by the controller designed using these inputs. However, without executing `loopsyn` and analyzing its output, it\'s not possible to definitively determine an `alpha` that guarantees these conditions will be met for the specific aircraft model `G`.\n\nA common engineering practice is to start with a balanced value for such tuning parameters. `alpha = 0.5` is a frequently used initial choice that provides a balance between performance and robustness objectives.\nIn an actual design workflow, one would:\n1. Call `loopsyn` with G, Gd, and this initial `alpha`.\n2. Obtain the controller `K` and the performance metric `gamma`.\n3. Analyze the closed-loop system `feedback(G*K, eye(size(G,1)))` to determine its disk margin.\n4. If the criteria (disk margin >= 0.05 and `gamma` < 1) are not met, `alpha` would be adjusted iteratively. For example, if the disk margin is too low, `alpha` would be decreased. If `gamma` is too high or performance in matching `Gd` is poor, `alpha` would be increased.\n\nFor the purpose of this task, which is to provide the input configuration file, `alpha = 0.5` is selected as a reasonable and standard starting point for the `loopsyn` design process.', config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.1262962080357924, 'gamma': 1.2864479830208597, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x112426d90>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x112426d30>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x112426bf0>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x112426cd0>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x112426cb0>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x112426a90>}}, 'score': 60.0}
