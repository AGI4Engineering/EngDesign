Here's the detailed reasoning and steps:\n\n### Step 1: Design a Target Loop Shape\n1. **Objective**: We need to specify a target loop shape that the controller should aim to achieve. The desired loop shape should have:\n   - A crossover frequency of 8 rad/s.\n   - Low gain at high frequencies for robustness.\n   - High gain at low frequencies for performance.\n\n2. **Transfer Function**: A simple transfer function that meets these criteria is `8/s`. This transfer function has a gain of 8 at low frequencies and decreases with frequency, which is typical for a system that needs to be robust at high frequencies and perform well at low frequencies.\n\n3. **Numerator and Denominator**: The transfer function `8/s` can be expressed in terms of its numerator and denominator coefficients:\n   - Numerator (num): [8]\n   - Denominator (den): [1, 0] (which represents `s`)\n\n### Step 2: Use loopsyn to Design a Controller\n1. **Inputs for loopsyn**:\n   - **G**: The dynamical system to be controlled, which is the aircraft model given in state-space form.\n   - **Gd**: The desired loop shape, which we have determined as `8/s` with num = [8] and den = [1, 0].\n   - **Alpha**: A factor to balance between performance and robustness. Since we need to ensure a disk margin of at least 0.05 and a performance gamma less than 1, we choose an alpha value that is less than 1. A typical choice for alpha is 0.5, which provides a balanced trade-off.\n\n2. **Design Considerations**:\n   - The controller should ensure the closed-loop system achieves at least a 0.05 disk margin.\n   - The performance gamma should be less than 1, indicating that the designed controller closely matches the desired loop shape.\n\nBy following these steps, we can use the loopsyn function to design a stabilizing controller for the aircraft system.", config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.1262962080357924, 'gamma': 1.2864479830208597, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d570>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d810>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d790>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d090>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d770>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d830>}}, 'score': 60.0}
