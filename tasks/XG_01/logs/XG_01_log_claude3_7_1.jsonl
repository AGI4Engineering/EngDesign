This is a simple integrator scaled by 8, which satisfies our requirements:\n- It has a crossover frequency at 8 rad/s\n- At low frequencies, the gain increases as 1/ω (high gain for good performance)\n- At high frequencies, the gain decreases as 1/ω (low gain for robustness)\n\nFor this transfer function 8/s:\n- Numerator = [8]\n- Denominator = [1, 0] (representing s in the denominator)\n\n## Step 2: Use loopsyn to Design a Controller\nNow I need to determine a suitable alpha value for the loopsyn function. The alpha parameter balances between performance (matching the desired loop shape) and robustness (ensuring stability margins).\n\nGiven the requirements:\n- Closed-loop system must achieve at least a 0.05 disk margin\n- Performance gamma must be less than 1\n\nLet's analyze what these requirements mean:\n- A disk margin of 0.05 is a relatively modest requirement for robustness\n- Gamma < 1 means we need good performance in matching the desired loop shape\n\nSince we need both robustness and performance, I'll choose an alpha value that balances these concerns. Based on experience with loopsyn, a moderate alpha value like 0.7 would be appropriate:\n- It gives enough weight to the robustness objective (higher alpha increases robustness)\n- It still maintains good performance in matching the desired loop shape\n\nTherefore, I'll set alpha = 0.7.\n\nMy final configuration for the loopsyn controller design:\n- Numerator coefficients of desired loop shape: [8]\n- Denominator coefficients of desired loop shape: [1, 0]\n- Alpha value: 0.7", config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.7)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.17839381889279216, 'gamma': 1.5927523108846378, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x106424c10>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x106424f30>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x106425490>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x1064254b0>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x1064254d0>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x1064254f0>}}, 'score': 60.0}
