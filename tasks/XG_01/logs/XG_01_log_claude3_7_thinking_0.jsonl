{'completion_tokens': 2786, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a stabilizing controller for the aircraft system using loopsyn, I need to first specify an appropriate target loop shape and then select a proper alpha value.\n\n1. Target Loop Shape Design:\nThe requirements specify:\n- Crossover frequency of 8 rad/s\n- Low gain at high frequencies (for robustness)\n- High gain at low frequencies (for performance)\n- Consider the transfer function 8/s as an example\n\nThe transfer function 8/s is indeed an ideal choice because:\n- It crosses 0dB (magnitude = 1) at exactly ω = 8 rad/s (since |8/jω| = 8/ω = 1 when ω = 8)\n- It has high gain at low frequencies (as ω approaches 0, gain approaches infinity)\n- It has low gain at high frequencies (as ω approaches infinity, gain approaches 0)\n\nIn polynomial form, this transfer function 8/s has:\n- Numerator coefficients: [8]\n- Denominator coefficients: [1, 0] (representing s)\n\n2. Alpha Selection:\nThe alpha parameter in loopsyn balances performance (matching the desired loop shape) versus robustness. Since we need:\n- At least a 0.05 disk margin (robustness requirement)\n- Performance gamma less than 1 (performance requirement)\n\nI'll choose alpha = 0.6 as a good balance. This value leans slightly toward performance while still maintaining sufficient robustness. With this aircraft model being a complex MIMO system (2 inputs, 2 outputs), this value should provide adequate margins while achieving the desired loop characteristics.", config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.6)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.14879102074679873, 'gamma': 1.4212814411746033, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c50d0>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c4f70>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c4f50>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c5190>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c51b0>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c51d0>}}, 'score': 60.0}
