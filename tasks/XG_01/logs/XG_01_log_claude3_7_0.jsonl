The value of alpha should be between 0 and 1, where:\n- Values closer to 0 emphasize performance (matching the desired loop shape)\n- Values closer to 1 emphasize robustness (stability margins)\n\nSince we need to achieve at least a 0.05 disk margin and a performance gamma less than 1, I'll choose alpha = 0.7 as a starting point. This value provides a reasonable balance between performance and robustness. If needed, alpha can be adjusted:\n- If the disk margin is less than 0.05, increase alpha\n- If gamma is greater than 1, decrease alpha\n\nTherefore, my final configuration for the loopsyn function is:\n- Numerator of desired loop shape: [8]\n- Denominator of desired loop shape: [1, 0]\n- Alpha value: 0.7", config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.7)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.17839381889279216, 'gamma': 1.5927523108846378, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x1064252b0>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x1064251b0>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x106424cf0>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x106424bd0>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x106424e70>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x106424e90>}}, 'score': 60.0}
