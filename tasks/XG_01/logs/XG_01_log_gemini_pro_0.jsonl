This configuration is intended for use with MATLAB\'s `loopsyn` function.\n\nStep 1: Determine Numerator (num) and Denominator (den) Coefficients for the Desired Loop Shape (Gd)\n- The problem states: "consider the transfer function 8/s as an example of a target loop shape".\n- This transfer function Gd(s) = 8/s fulfills the qualitative criteria mentioned: crossover at 8 rad/s, high gain at low frequencies, and low gain at high frequencies.\n- For Gd(s) = 8/s:\n  - The numerator polynomial is 8 (which is 8 * s^0).\n  - The denominator polynomial is s (which is 1 * s^1 + 0 * s^0).\n- In MATLAB, transfer function coefficients are typically represented as vectors. Thus:\n  - `num` (numerator coefficients) = `[8.0]`\n  - `den` (denominator coefficients) = `[1.0, 0.0]`\n\nStep 2: Determine Alpha (alpha)\n- The problem specifies: "alpha: a factor (0 < alpha < 1) to balance between performance and robustness".\n- It also states design goals: "closed-loop system achieves at least a 0.05 disk margin" and "has a performance gamma less than 1".\n- No specific value for `alpha` is explicitly provided in the text for the configuration file itself. The `loopsyn` function uses `alpha` to trade off between achieving the desired loop shape `Gd` (performance) and ensuring robust stability.\n- The problem requires `alpha` to be strictly between 0 and 1.\n- Since a specific value for `alpha` is not given and the task is to provide a complete configuration, a common default or starting value is appropriate. `alpha = 0.5` is a standard choice that balances performance and robustness and satisfies the 0 < alpha < 1 constraint.\n- The problem asks for an input configuration for `loopsyn`, not the outcome of the design process. The specified disk margin and gamma are targets for the design process, which might involve tuning `alpha` iteratively. For this configuration, a representative value of 0.5 is chosen for `alpha`.\n\nStep 3: Construct the JSON Object\n- Based on the determined values:\n  - `num`: `[8.0]`\n  - `den`: `[1.0, 0.0]`\n  - `alpha`: `0.5`\n- These values are used to populate the `config` field of the final JSON object, adhering to the provided `ConfigFile` schema. The `reasoning` field explains these choices.', config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.1262962080357924, 'gamma': 1.2864479830208597, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x112426a10>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x1124261f0>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x1124269d0>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x1124269b0>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x1124261d0>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x112426a30>}}, 'score': 60.0}
