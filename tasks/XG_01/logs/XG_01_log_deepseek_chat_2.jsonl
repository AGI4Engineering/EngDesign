{'completion_tokens': 282, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a stabilizing controller for the aircraft system using MATLAB's loopsyn function, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Design the Target Loop Shape**: The desired loop shape should have a crossover frequency of 8 rad/s, high gain at low frequencies for performance, and low gain at high frequencies for robustness. A simple transfer function that meets these criteria is 8/s, which has a numerator of [8] and a denominator of [1, 0].\n\n2. **Use loopsyn to Design the Controller**: The loopsyn function will take the aircraft model (G), the desired loop shape (Gd), and an alpha value to balance performance and robustness. For this task, we choose alpha = 0.5 as a balanced value. The loopsyn function will then return a controller K that ensures the closed-loop system meets the specified disk margin and performance gamma requirements.\n\n3. **Verify the Design**: After obtaining the controller, we will verify that the closed-loop system achieves at least a 0.05 disk margin and has a performance gamma less than 1. This ensures that the designed controller meets the robustness and performance criteria.", config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.1262962080357924, 'gamma': 1.2864479830208597, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x118c33290>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x118c332b0>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x118c333d0>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x118c33810>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x118c33390>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x118c33310>}}, 'score': 60.0}
