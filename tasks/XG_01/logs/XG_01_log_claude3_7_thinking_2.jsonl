{'completion_tokens': 2966, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="I need to design a stabilizing controller for an aircraft system using MATLAB's loopsyn function. The first step is to define a target loop shape transfer function.\n\nFor the target loop shape, I need:\n- Crossover frequency of 8 rad/s\n- Low gain at high frequencies (for robustness)\n- High gain at low frequencies (for performance)\n\nThe example given is 8/s, which is a simple integrator with gain 8. This satisfies our requirements because:\n- It has infinite gain at DC (good for low frequency performance)\n- It rolls off at -20 dB/decade (good for high frequency robustness)\n- With gain 8, the crossover frequency will be at 8 rad/s (where |G(jω)| = 1)\n\nIn MATLAB transfer function form, 8/s would be represented as tf(8, [1 0]) where:\n- Numerator coefficients: [8]\n- Denominator coefficients: [1, 0] (representing 1*s + 0)\n\nFor the alpha value in loopsyn, I need to balance performance (matching the desired loop shape, gamma < 1) and robustness (disk margin ≥ 0.05). Alpha ranges from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 prioritize performance and values closer to 0 prioritize robustness.\n\nI'll choose alpha = 0.4, which leans slightly toward robustness while still allowing for good performance. This should help ensure we meet the disk margin requirement of at least 0.05 while keeping gamma < 1.", config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.4)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.11491945661073442, 'gamma': 1.1693863760476992, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c4f50>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c52b0>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c5450>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c4d90>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c4ef0>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c53d0>}}, 'score': 60.0}
