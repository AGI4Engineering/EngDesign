{'completion_tokens': 334, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a stabilizing controller for the aircraft system using MATLAB's loopsyn function, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Design the Target Loop Shape**: The desired loop shape should have a crossover frequency of 8 rad/s, high gain at low frequencies for performance, and low gain at high frequencies for robustness. A simple transfer function that meets these criteria is 8/s, which is an integrator with gain 8. This transfer function has a numerator of [8] and a denominator of [1, 0].\n\n2. **Use loopsyn to Design the Controller**: The loopsyn function will take the aircraft model (G), the desired loop shape (Gd defined by the numerator [8] and denominator [1, 0]), and an alpha value to balance performance and robustness. We choose alpha = 0.5 as a starting point, which is a common default value that balances performance and robustness.\n\n3. **Verify the Design**: After obtaining the controller K, we need to verify that the closed-loop system achieves at least a 0.05 disk margin and has a performance gamma less than 1. If these conditions are not met, we may need to adjust the alpha value or the target loop shape.\n\nGiven the requirements, the configuration for the loopsyn function includes the numerator [8], denominator [1, 0], and alpha = 0.5.", config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.1262962080357924, 'gamma': 1.2864479830208597, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x118c33130>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x118c33390>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x118c33430>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x118c331b0>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x118c333b0>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x118c335f0>}}, 'score': 60.0}
