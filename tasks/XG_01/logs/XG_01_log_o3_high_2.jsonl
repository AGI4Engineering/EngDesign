{'completion_tokens': 667, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Step-1: To produce high low-frequency gain and low high-frequency gain with crossover ≈ 8 rad/s, use the simple first-order integrator loop-shape Ld(s)=8/s.  In polynomial form that means numerator = 8, denominator = s, i.e. [1 0].  \n\nStep-2: When calling loopsyn you supply the plant G (aircraft ss), the desired loop shape Gd = tf(num,den) and a tuning factor α.  Choosing α somewhere in the middle (e.g. 0.5) usually yields a good compromise between matching the loop-shape (γ ≈1) and keeping robustness (disk margin >0.05).  A typical design command is:\n    [K,CL,gamma,info] = loopsyn(G, tf([8],[1 0]), 0.5);\nAfter synthesis you would verify that gamma < 1 and that the diskmargin(CL) lower bound is ≥0.05.  If either requirement is violated you would decrease α slightly (to favour robustness) or refine the desired shape, but α=0.5 generally meets the stated targets for this aircraft model.\n\nTherefore the configuration needed by the evaluator is simply the polynomial coefficients for 8/s and α = 0.5.', config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.1262962080357924, 'gamma': 1.2864479830208597, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x122a0fa90>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x122a0f690>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x122a0f8d0>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x122a0f7d0>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x122a0fc30>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x122a0fc50>}}, 'score': 60.0}
