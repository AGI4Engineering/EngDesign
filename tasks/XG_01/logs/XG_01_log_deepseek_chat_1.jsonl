{'completion_tokens': 272, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a stabilizing controller for the aircraft system using MATLAB's loopsyn function, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Design the Target Loop Shape**: The desired loop shape should have a crossover frequency of 8 rad/s, low gain at high frequencies for robustness, and high gain at low frequencies for performance. A simple transfer function that meets these criteria is 8/s. This transfer function has a numerator of [8] and a denominator of [1, 0].\n\n2. **Use loopsyn to Design the Controller**: The loopsyn function will take the aircraft model (G), the desired loop shape (Gd), and an alpha value to balance performance and robustness. For this task, we choose an alpha of 0.5 to equally prioritize performance and robustness. The loopsyn function will then compute the controller K such that the closed-loop system achieves at least a 0.05 disk margin and a performance gamma less than 1.\n\n3. **Verification**: After designing the controller, we will verify that the closed-loop system meets the specified disk margin and performance gamma requirements.", config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.1262962080357924, 'gamma': 1.2864479830208597, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x118c334d0>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x118c33730>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x118c33750>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x118c33790>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x118c337b0>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x118c33610>}}, 'score': 60.0}
