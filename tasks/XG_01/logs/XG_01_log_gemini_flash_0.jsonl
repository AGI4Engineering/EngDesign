{'completion_tokens': 187, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The task requires specifying the numerator and denominator coefficients for a desired loop shape transfer function of 8/s and choosing an appropriate alpha value for the loopsyn function. The transfer function 8/s has a numerator of 8 and a denominator of s, which can be represented as the coefficients [8] for the numerator and [1, 0] for the denominator. An alpha value needs to be selected to balance performance and robustness; I will start by trying 0.7.
