Without being able to run actual tests in MATLAB, I'll choose alpha = 0.5 as a reasonable balance. This middle value should provide sufficient robustness while still maintaining good performance. If we could iterate the design, we might fine-tune this value, but 0.5 represents a reasonable starting point that balances our competing requirements.", config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.1262962080357924, 'gamma': 1.2864479830208597, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c5210>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c4cb0>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c5010>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c5110>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c4a30>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x1052c4f10>}}, 'score': 60.0}
