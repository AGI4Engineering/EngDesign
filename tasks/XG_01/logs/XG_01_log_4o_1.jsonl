{'completion_tokens': 410, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a stabilizing controller for the given aircraft system using MATLAB's loopsyn function, we need to follow a structured approach:\n\n### Step 1: Design a Target Loop Shape\n1. **Objective**: We need a target loop shape that has a crossover frequency of 8 rad/s, low gain at high frequencies for robustness, and high gain at low frequencies for performance.\n2. **Transfer Function**: A simple transfer function that meets these criteria is \\( \\frac{8}{s} \\). This function has a gain of 8 at low frequencies and decreases with frequency, providing the desired characteristics.\n3. **Numerator and Denominator**: For the transfer function \\( \\frac{8}{s} \\), the numerator is [8] and the denominator is [1, 0].\n\n### Step 2: Use loopsyn to Design a Controller\n1. **Inputs for loopsyn**:\n   - **G**: The aircraft model, which is given in state-space form.\n   - **Gd**: The desired loop shape, which we have defined as \\( \\frac{8}{s} \\) with num = [8] and den = [1, 0].\n   - **Alpha**: This is a tuning parameter to balance performance and robustness. A typical choice is 0.5, but it can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the system.\n\n2. **Design Requirements**:\n   - The closed-loop system must achieve at least a 0.05 disk margin.\n   - The performance gamma must be less than 1, indicating that the designed controller closely matches the desired loop shape.\n\nBy following these steps, we can use the loopsyn function to design a controller that stabilizes the aircraft system while meeting the specified performance and robustness criteria.", config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.1262962080357924, 'gamma': 1.2864479830208597, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d550>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d370>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d1d0>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d5f0>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d510>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d4b0>}}, 'score': 60.0}
