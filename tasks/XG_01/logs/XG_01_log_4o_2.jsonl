{'completion_tokens': 448, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a stabilizing controller for the given aircraft system using MATLAB's Robust Control Toolbox, specifically the loopsyn function, we need to follow a structured approach. Here's the detailed reasoning and steps:\n\n### Step 1: Design a Target Loop Shape\n1. **Objective**: We need to design a target loop shape that has a crossover frequency of 8 rad/s, low gain at high frequencies for robustness, and high gain at low frequencies for performance.\n2. **Transfer Function**: A simple transfer function that meets these criteria is \\( \\frac{8}{s} \\). This transfer function has a gain of 8 at low frequencies and decreases with frequency, which is typical for a system that needs to be robust at high frequencies and perform well at low frequencies.\n3. **Numerator and Denominator**: For the transfer function \\( \\frac{8}{s} \\), the numerator is [8] and the denominator is [1, 0].\n\n### Step 2: Use *loopsyn* to Design a Controller\n1. **Inputs for loopsyn**:\n   - **G**: This is the dynamical system to be controlled, which is the aircraft model given in state-space form.\n   - **Gd**: This is the desired loop shape, which we have determined as \\( \\frac{8}{s} \\) with numerator [8] and denominator [1, 0].\n   - **Alpha**: This is a factor to balance between performance and robustness. A typical value for alpha is 0.5, which provides a balance between the two.\n2. **Design Requirements**:\n   - The closed-loop system must achieve at least a 0.05 disk margin.\n   - The performance gamma must be less than 1, indicating that the designed controller closely matches the desired loop shape.\n\nBy following these steps, we can use the loopsyn function to design a controller that stabilizes the aircraft system while meeting the specified performance and robustness criteria.", config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.1262962080357924, 'gamma': 1.2864479830208597, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d570>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d090>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d790>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d6f0>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d470>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x11111d8f0>}}, 'score': 60.0}
