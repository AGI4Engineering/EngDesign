Has a magnitude of 8/ω, crossing 0dB at ω=8 rad/s\n2. Has high gain at low frequencies (approaching infinity as ω→0)\n3. Has decreasing gain at high frequencies (roll-off of -20 dB/decade)\n\n### Step 2: Use loopsyn to Design a Controller\n\nFor the loopsyn function, I need to determine the alpha parameter to balance performance and robustness. The requirements state:\n- The closed-loop system must achieve at least a 0.05 disk margin\n- The performance gamma must be less than 1\n\nSince alpha controls the trade-off between performance and robustness, I'll choose a moderate value that should satisfy both requirements. Values closer to 0 prioritize performance, while values closer to 1 prioritize robustness.\n\nGiven the constraints, I'll choose alpha = 0.7 which should provide a good balance between:\n- Ensuring adequate disk margin (robustness)\n- Maintaining good performance (gamma < 1)\n\nThis value is a reasonable starting point that often works well in practice for systems with moderate control challenges. If needed, this value could be adjusted through iteration to better meet the specific requirements.\n\nTherefore, my configuration is:\n- num = [8] (numerator of desired loop shape)\n- den = [1, 0] (denominator of desired loop shape)\n- alpha = 0.7 (balancing parameter for loopsyn)", config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.7)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.17839381889279216, 'gamma': 1.5927523108846378, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x1064252b0>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x106425350>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x1064255d0>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x106424cf0>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x106424e90>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x106425570>}}, 'score': 60.0}
