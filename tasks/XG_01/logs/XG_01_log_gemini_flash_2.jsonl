{'completion_tokens': 190, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The task is to design a stabilizing controller for the aircraft system using the loopsyn function in MATLAB's Robust Control Toolbox. The first step involves defining the desired loop shape by specifying the numerator and denominator coefficients of its transfer function. A suitable loop shape with a crossover frequency of 8 rad/s and high/low gains at low/high frequencies is given as 8/s. This means the numerator is 8 and the denominator is simply 's', represented by the coefficients [1 0]. The next step is to choose an appropriate alpha value between 0 and 1 which affects performance vs robustness, I will set this to 0.5.", config=ConfigFile(num=[8.0], den=[1.0, 0.0], alpha=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'diskmargin': 0.1262962080357924, 'gamma': 1.2864479830208597, 'info': {'W': <matlab.object object at 0x10b526230>, 'Gs': <matlab.object object at 0x10b526e70>, 'Ks': <matlab.object object at 0x10b526c90>, 'emax': 0.21771377501462572, 'W1': <matlab.object object at 0x10b526e30>, 'W3': <matlab.object object at 0x10b526a70>, 'K2dof': <matlab.object object at 0x10b526d30>}}, 'score': 60.0}
