{'completion_tokens': 672, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Examine the image array: it is quite large (≈ 500 × 100) and has a slow-varying illumination gradient with some high-frequency details (textured zones). 2. A light Gaussian blur is necessary to suppress small-scale noise but still keep most geometric edges. Empirically, a 5-pixel window (standard 5×5 kernel) balances noise reduction and edge sharpness for images of this size, so gaussian = 5. 3. For edge detection, we need a pair of kernels of identical size and shape that respond to horizontal and vertical intensity changes. The classical 3×3 Sobel operators already satisfy this, give strong response at genuine edges and mild response to noise, and are computationally light, so they are chosen for edge_x and edge_y. 4. To keep only “significant” edges while discarding residual noise, thresholds are set after considering the expected Sobel magnitude range on an 8-bit image: weak texture produces magnitudes < 20, strong object boundaries usually exceed 30–40, while the theoretical maximum on 8-bit data is ≈ 1020. A practical window [30, 255] therefore retains structurally relevant edges and rejects most noise. 5. These parameters satisfy the task requirements and can be fed directly into any standard convolution / Canny-style pipeline.', config=ConfigFile(gaussian=5.0, edge_x=[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]], edge_y=[[1.0, 2.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [-1.0, -2.0, -1.0]], maximum=255.0, minimum=30.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'edge_density': np.float64(0.0), 'num_features': 0, 'entropy': np.float64(0.0), 'total_loss': np.float64(68.06050498271534)}, 'score': np.float64(56.939495017284656)}
