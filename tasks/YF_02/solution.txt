## Proposed Design

- Th (thickness): 20 mm

## Reasoning
To determine a suitable thickness (Th) for the rectangular steel beam, we need to ensure that the maximum vertical displacement is less than 1 mm when subjected to the dual-point load.\n\nGiven that the beam is experiencing a vertical load and has a simply supported boundary condition, the primary concern is bending. The stiffness of a beam is related to its moment of inertia (I), which for a rectangular section is given by:\n\nI = (width * Th^3) / 12\n\nThe deflection (δ) in a simply supported beam under point loads can be approximated by using the formula:\n\nδ = (F * a^2 * (3 * L - 4 * a)) / (24 * E * I)\n\nwhere F is the applied force, a is the distance from the support to the load, L is the total length of the beam, E is the Young’s modulus, and I is the moment of inertia.\n\nIn our case, the forces are applied at L/4 and 3L/4. Thus, a = L/4 = 250 mm.\n\nWe want the maximum deflection to be less than 1 mm. Solving for Th from the deflection equation, we get:\n\n1 mm = (1000 N * (250 mm)^2 * (3 * 1000 mm - 4 * 250 mm)) / (24 * 210,000 MPa * (40 mm * Th^3 / 12))\n\nSimplifying and solving for Th:\n\n1 = (1000 * 250^2 * 500) / (24 * 210,000 * 40 / 12 * Th^3)\n\nBy solving the above equation, we try an iterative approach or direct computation to find suitable Th.\n\nComputing, we find Th ~ 20 mm ensures that the displacement is under 1 mm, providing a structurally sound design for the beam.\n\nThus, my proposed thickness for the beam is Th = 20 mm.' config=ConfigFile(Th=20.0)
