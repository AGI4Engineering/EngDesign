{'completion_tokens': 1193, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I calculated the optimal thickness for the beam using beam deflection theory. For a simply supported beam with two equal forces at quarter points, the maximum deflection formula is δ = (FL³)/(48EI) * (3/4), where I = (w*Th³)/12. Using the given parameters (L=1000mm, w=40mm, F=1000N each load, E=210GPa), I derived that δ = 44,642,857/(Th³). For optimal scoring, we need the deflection to be between 0.7-0.9mm (70-90% of the 1mm threshold). Solving for Th with a target deflection of 0.8mm gives Th ≈ 38.36mm. I verified that with Th=38mm, the expected deflection would be approximately 0.814mm, which is 81.4% of the allowable limit - placing it well within the optimal scoring range of 70-90%.', config=ConfigFile(Th=38.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.27284809245546654, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 38.97829892220951}
