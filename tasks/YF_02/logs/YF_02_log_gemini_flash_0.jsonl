{'completion_tokens': 165, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The thickness of the beam (Th) significantly affects its stiffness and resistance to bending. A larger thickness will increase the beam's moment of inertia, leading to reduced displacement under the applied loads. Since the beam is subjected to dual-point loads, a reasonable initial guess for Th can be determined by ensuring that the maximum displacement is less than the allowable limit (1mm). I'll start with a thickness that I believe provides a balance between material usage and structural performance. Considering L = 1000, w = 40, and F = 1000 N at two points, a Th of 20 mm seems to be a reasonable initial guess.", config=ConfigFile(Th=20.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.9732440539965839, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 26.75594600341613}
