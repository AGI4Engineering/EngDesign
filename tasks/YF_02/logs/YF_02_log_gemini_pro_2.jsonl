The formula for maximum deflection for a simply supported beam with two symmetric point loads F, each at a distance L/4 from the supports, is `delta_max = (11 * F * L^3) / (384 * E * I)`, where `I` is the area moment of inertia (`w * Th^3 / 12` for a rectangular section). This can be rewritten as `delta_max = (11 * F * L^3) / (32 * E * w * Th^3)`.\n\nGiven parameters:\n- Total span length, L = 1000 mm\n- Beam width, w = 40 mm\n- Applied force, F = 1000 N (each of two forces)\n- Youngâ€™s modulus, E = 210,000 MPa\n\nThe performance criterion is that the maximum vertical displacement (`uy`) must be less than 1 mm. Full points are awarded if the ratio of measured displacement to the 1 mm threshold is between 70% and 90% (i.e., displacement between 0.7 mm and 0.9 mm).\n\nWe aim for a theoretical deflection that is robustly within this optimal range, considering potential deviations when evaluated by 3D structural simulation. 3D simulations can yield slightly different results than 1D beam theory due to effects like shear deformation (though minor for this L/Th ratio) and local stress/strain concentrations at load and support points.\n\nLet's test Th = 37.5 mm:\n`I = (40 * 37.5^3) / 12 = (40 * 52734.375) / 12 = 2109375 / 12 = 175781.25 mm^4`.\n`delta_max = (11 * 1000 N * (1000 mm)^3) / (32 * 210000 N/mm^2 * 40 mm * (37.5 mm)^3)`\n`delta_max = (11 * 10^12) / (32 * 210000 * 40 * 52734.375)`\n`delta_max = (11 * 10^12) / (268800000 * 52734.375)`\n`delta_max = (11 * 10^12) / 14174850000000`\n`delta_max = 11 / 14174.85 = 0.00077602 mm * 1000 = 0.77602 mm`.\n\nThis deflection of 0.776 mm is 77.6% of the 1 mm threshold, which falls comfortably within the target [70%, 90%] range. This choice allows for the actual 3D simulated deflection to be up to ~16.0% higher than beam theory (0.776 * 1.160 = 0.900 mm) or up to ~9.8% lower (0.776 * 0.902 = 0.700 mm) and still achieve the maximum score.\n\nThe maximum bending stress for Th=37.5 mm is `sigma_max = (1.5 * F * L) / (w * Th^2) = (1.5 * 1000 * 1000) / (40 * 37.5^2) = 1500000 / 56250 = 26.67 MPa`. This is well below the yield strength of typical steel (e.g., >250 MPa), confirming the design is governed by stiffness, not strength.", config=ConfigFile(Th=37.5)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.2800447099316143, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 40.006387133087756}
