{'completion_tokens': 2802, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. We model the beam as a simply supported prismatic beam of length L=1000 mm, width w=40 mm, thickness h=Th.\n2. Two equal point loads P=1000 N are applied at x=L/4 and x=3L/4. By symmetry, the maximum deflection occurs at midspan (x=L/2).\n3. From classical beam theory for a single point load P at a distance a from the left support, the deflection at midspan x=L/2 is:\n   δ₁ = [P·a·(L–x)·(2Lx – x² – a²)]/(6·E·I·L)\n   with a=L/4, x=L/2.  For two loads the total deflection δ=2·δ₁.\n4. The second moment of area for a rectangular section (width w, height h) is I = w·h³/12.  Here w=40 mm ⇒ I = (40·Th³)/12.\n5. Substituting numbers and simplifying gives\n   δ ≃ 40923/Th³   (mm).\n6. To satisfy δ ≤1 mm ⇒ Th³ ≥40923 ⇒ Th ≥³√40923 ≃34.5 mm.\n7. However, to earn full score the measured deflection must be ≤0.9 mm (i.e. ≤90% of the 1 mm threshold).  Setting δ=0.9 mm ⇒ Th³ ≥40923/0.9 ≃45469 ⇒ Th ≥³√45469 ≃35.6 mm.\n8. Rounding up to a practical milled thickness, we choose Th=36 mm, which yields δ≈0.877 mm (<0.9 mm) and thus meets the full‐score criterion without excessive weight.', config=ConfigFile(Th=36.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.30351047685620064, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 43.358639550885805}
