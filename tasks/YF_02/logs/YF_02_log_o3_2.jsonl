{'completion_tokens': 3550, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To select an economical yet safe thickness (Th) I first estimated the mid-span deflection of a simply-supported prismatic beam carrying two equal point loads at L/4 and 3L/4.  \n\n1.  Beam theory formula (Roark, simple beam – two equal symmetric loads):\n   δ_max = P·a·(3L² – 4a²) / (24·E·I),  where a = L/4.\n\n2.  Insert given data (L = 1000 mm, a = 250 mm, P = 1000 N each, E = 210 000 MPa):\n   δ_max ≈ 40 900 / I  (mm) with I in mm⁴.\n\n3.  For a solid rectangular section I = w·Th³ / 12 = (40·Th³)/12 = (10/3)·Th³.\n   Hence δ_max ≈ 40 900 / ( (10/3)·Th³ · 24·210 000 /24) simplifies to\n   δ_max ≈ 40 900 / Th³  (mm).\n\n4.  The performance window that yields full marks is a displacement ratio between 0.7 mm and 0.9 mm (70 %–90 % of the 1 mm limit).\n\n5.  Solving 40 900 / Th³ = 0.8 mm (mid-window) gives Th ≈ 37 mm.\n   • Th ≈ 34.7 mm would just meet the 1 mm limit.  \n   • Th ≈ 38.6 mm would give the bottom end of the window (0.7 mm).\n   • Picking 37 mm provides a good buffer so that small modelling differences (shear deflection, 3-D effects) still keep the ratio safely between 0.7 and 0.9.\n\n6.  The chosen value is also practical: the height is slightly less than the width (40 mm), yielding a compact rectangular section that is easy to fabricate.\n\nTherefore, proposing Th = 37 mm should give a maximum vertical displacement close to 0.8 mm, satisfying both the structural requirement and the scoring criterion.', config=ConfigFile(Th=37.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.28760058734985366, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 41.08579819283624}
