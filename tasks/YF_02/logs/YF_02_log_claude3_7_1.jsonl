For a simply supported beam with two 1000N loads at quarter-spans, the maximum deflection occurs at midspan. Using the formula δmax = (23 × P × L³) / (648 × E × I) where I = (w × Th³)/12, I determined that a thickness of 40mm would result in a maximum deflection of approximately 0.792mm, which is 79.2% of the allowable 1mm threshold.
