Target performance: keep maximum vertical displacement uy under 1 mm while ideally using 70 – 90 % of this allowance to score full points.\n\n2. Ideal-beam estimate (Euler-Bernoulli bending)\n   • Simply supported span L = 1000 mm, two equal point loads P = 1000 N applied at a = L/4 = 250 mm.\n   • Maximum mid-span deflection for this loading is\n     δ_max = 11 P L³ / (384 E I)\n     (derived from piece-wise integration of M/EI or Roark’s Formulas).\n   • Required second moment of area for δ = 1 mm:\n     I_req = 11 P L³ / (384 E δ)\n            = 11·1000·(1000³) / (384·210 000·1)\n            ≈ 1.36 × 10⁵ mm⁴.\n\n3. Rectangular section with width b = 40 mm gives\n   I = b h³ /12 = (40 h³)/12 = (10/3) h³.\n   Setting I ≥ I_req → h³ ≥ 40 920 → h ≈ 34.6 mm.\n   Thus a height of 34.6 mm would put the beam exactly at the 1 mm limit.\n\n4. Positioning inside the 0.70 – 0.90 performance window\n   • Deflection scales with 1/h³.  To obtain roughly 0.8 mm (80 % of limit):\n     0.8 = (34.6/h)³  →  h ≈ 37 mm.\n\n5. Safety and model nuances\n   • 3-D PDE simulation will include shear flexibility and Poisson effects that slightly increase deflection compared with pure bending (≈3–7 % for L/h ≈ 27).  Choosing 37 mm leaves comfortable margin while staying in the desired 70–90 % band.\n   • Manufacturing practicality: a 37 mm plate is easy to specify and keeps weight reasonable (only ~8 % more material than the theoretical minimum of 34.6 mm).\n\nConclusion: a thickness of 37 mm is structurally sound and expected to give a displacement ≈0.8–0.85 mm (≈80–85 % of the limit), meeting the full-score criterion with a modest safety buffer.', config=ConfigFile(Th=37.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.28760058734985366, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 41.08579819283624}
