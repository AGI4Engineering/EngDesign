{'completion_tokens': 147, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To determine the appropriate thickness 'Th' for the L-beam, I need to consider the relationship between thickness and stiffness. A thicker beam will be stiffer and thus have lower displacement under the applied load.  I will start with a reasonable guess for 'Th', taking into account that the beam width is 40 mm and we desire a maximum displacement less than 1mm under a 2000N (total) load. I'll select 50mm as my initial guess. This provides a decent aspect ratio and should provide adequate stiffness for the specified material and loading.", config=ConfigFile(Th=50.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.15945242880351582, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 22.77891840050226}
