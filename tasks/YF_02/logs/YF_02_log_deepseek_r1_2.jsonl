{'completion_tokens': 5854, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The proposed thickness (Th) of 40 mm is determined based on beam deflection calculations for a simply supported beam with two symmetric point loads at quarter spans. Using the formula for maximum deflection at the load points, Th=40 mm results in a displacement of approximately 0.84 mm, which is within the 70-90% range (0.7-0.9 mm) of the allowable 1 mm threshold. This ensures the beam meets the stiffness requirement while optimizing the score. The calculation considers the moment of inertia (I = w·Th³/12) and superposition of deflections from both loads, ensuring geometric and material constraints (E=210,000 MPa, ν=0.3) are satisfied.', config=ConfigFile(Th=40.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.2467458530151612, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 35.24940757359446}
