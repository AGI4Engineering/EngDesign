{'completion_tokens': 372, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To determine a suitable thickness (Th) for the steel beam, we consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Loading and Boundary Conditions**: The beam is simply supported with two point loads at quarter-span locations (250 mm and 750 mm from one end). Each load is 1000 N, totaling 2000 N.\n\n2. **Stiffness Requirement**: The maximum vertical displacement (uy) must be less than 1 mm. For a simply supported beam with dual-point loads, the maximum deflection occurs at the center and can be approximated using beam theory. However, since we are using 3D simulation, we rely on prior knowledge or empirical data to estimate the thickness.\n\n3. **Initial Estimate**: For a steel beam (E = 210,000 MPa) with L = 1000 mm, w = 40 mm, and F = 2000 N, a thickness of 20 mm is a reasonable starting point. This is based on typical beam proportions and stiffness requirements for similar loading conditions.\n\n4. **Refinement**: To ensure the displacement ratio falls between 70% and 90% of the 1 mm limit, we adjust the thickness. A thicker beam (e.g., 25 mm) would reduce displacement below 70%, while a thinner beam (e.g., 15 mm) might exceed 90%. A thickness of 20 mm is likely to yield a displacement close to 0.8 mm (80% of the limit), which falls within the optimal scoring range.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: A thickness of 20 mm is proposed as it balances stiffness and material usage while likely meeting the displacement criteria for full credit.', config=ConfigFile(Th=20.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.9732440539965839, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 26.75594600341613}
