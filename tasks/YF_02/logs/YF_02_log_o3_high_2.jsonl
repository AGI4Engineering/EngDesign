Predicted mid-span deflection ≈ 0.81 mm (≈ 81 % of the 1 mm limit), which sits in the optimal 70-90 % band with a modest safety cushion.\n•  Provides adequate stiffness, keeps material usage reasonable, and gives full score under the stated rubric.', config=ConfigFile(Th=37.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.28760058734985366, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 41.08579819283624}
