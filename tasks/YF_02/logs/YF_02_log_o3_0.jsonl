{'completion_tokens': 5170, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Objective: pick a beam thickness Th so that the maximum vertical deflection uy under two 1 kN quarter-span loads is just under the 1 mm limit, preferably giving a displacement between 0.7 mm and 0.9 mm (70-90 % of the limit) in order to score full points.\n2. Modelling approach: treat the member as a simply–supported prismatic beam and estimate the elastic mid-span deflection with classic Euler-Bernoulli bending theory.  Shear deformation is minor for steel and the 1 m span, so it is neglected for a first-pass sizing.\n3. Formula: for two equal, symmetrically placed point loads P located a = L/4 from each support, maximum deflection is\n   δ_max = (11·P·L³) / (384·E·I).\n4. Data: P = 1000 N, L = 1000 mm, E = 210 000 N/mm², width b = 40 mm, height h = Th.  The second moment of area is I = b·h³/12.\n5. Substitute and rearrange: δ_max ≈ 40 920 / h³  (mm).\n6. Solve for h that gives δ ≈ 0.8 mm (mid–range of 70-90 % band):\n   h³ = 40 920 / 0.8 ≈ 51 150 ⇒ h ≈ 37 mm.\n7. Sensitivity check:• h = 37 mm ⇒ δ_pred ≈ 0.81 mm (ratio 0.81).  \n   • Even a ±10 % discrepancy (0.73-0.89 mm) still sits safely inside the 0.70-0.90 window.\n8. Practicality: 37 mm is readily achievable, keeps the beam weight moderate, and provides a comfortable safety margin below the 1 mm deflection cap without being excessively stiff.\n9. Conclusion: choose Th = 37 mm.', config=ConfigFile(Th=37.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.28760058734985366, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 41.08579819283624}
