The beam is simply supported with a span of 1000 mm, width of 40 mm, and is subjected to two 1000 N forces at quarter-span locations. The material has a Young’s modulus of 210,000 MPa and Poisson’s ratio of 0.3. The performance criterion requires the maximum vertical displacement to be less than 1 mm, with optimal performance achieved when the displacement is between 70% and 90% of this threshold (0.7 mm to 0.9 mm).\n\nGiven the symmetry and loading conditions, the beam's stiffness is primarily influenced by its thickness (Th). A thicker beam will have higher stiffness, resulting in smaller displacements. To ensure the displacement falls within the optimal range, we propose a thickness that balances stiffness and material usage. Based on typical engineering practices and preliminary calculations, a thickness of 20 mm is a reasonable starting point. This value is likely to keep the displacement within the desired range without being overly conservative or insufficient.", config=ConfigFile(Th=20.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.9732440539965839, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 26.75594600341613}
