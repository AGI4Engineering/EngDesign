{'completion_tokens': 9227, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I determined the appropriate thickness using beam deflection theory for a simply supported beam with two symmetric point loads. For the given loading (two 1000N forces at quarter-span positions), material properties (E=210,000 MPa), and geometric constraints (L=1000mm, w=40mm), I derived that the maximum deflection at midspan would be approximately δ_max = 163.69/Th³. To achieve a displacement between 70% and 90% of the 1mm threshold (0.7-0.9mm), the thickness should be between 5.68mm and 6.16mm. I selected 6.0mm as my final design value, which should result in a maximum displacement of approximately 0.76mm (76% of threshold), placing it well within the optimal scoring range while ensuring structural adequacy.', config=ConfigFile(Th=6.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 10.731394684631999, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 0.0}
