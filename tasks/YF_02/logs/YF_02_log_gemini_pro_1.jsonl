This value was determined using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory for a simply supported rectangular beam with two symmetric point loads.\n\nKey parameters and formula:\n- Beam: Span `L=1000 mm`, width `w=40 mm`.\n- Material: Young's modulus `E=210,000 MPa`.\n- Loading: Two forces `F=1000 N` each, at `L/4` and `3L/4` span.\n- Max deflection formula: `delta_max = (11 * F * L^3) / (384 * E * I)`.\n- Moment of inertia for rectangular section: `I = (w * Th^3) / 12`.\n\nCalculations:\n1. Target `delta_max = 0.8 mm` (midpoint of the optimal `0.7-0.9 mm` range to maximize score robustness).\n2. Calculate required Moment of Inertia `I` for `delta_max = 0.8 mm`:\n   `I = (11 * 1000 N * (1000 mm)^3) / (384 * 210000 N/mm^2 * 0.8 mm) ≈ 170510 mm^4`.\n3. Calculate required thickness `Th` from `I`:\n   `Th = (12 * I / w)^(1/3) = (12 * 170510 mm^4 / 40 mm)^(1/3) ≈ 37.1208 mm`.\n\nProposed `Th = 37.1 mm`.\nThis value is a practical rounding of the calculated `37.1208 mm`. Using `Th = 37.1 mm`, the theoretical deflection is calculated as approximately `0.802 mm` (`(11 * 1000 * 1000^3) / (384 * 210000 * (40 * 37.1^3 / 12))`). This deflection falls well within the desired `0.7 mm` to `0.9 mm` range. The beam's aspect ratio (`L/Th = 1000/37.1 ≈ 26.9`) is sufficiently large for Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to be a good approximation, minimizing the impact of shear deformation, though minor deviations might occur in the 3D FEM simulation.", config=ConfigFile(Th=37.1)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.2860252011862078, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 40.860743026601114}
