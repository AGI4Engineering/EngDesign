{'completion_tokens': 6595, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A straightforward way to gauge the necessary thickness is to compare the beam’s deflection against the 1 mm target using standard beam‐deflection formulas. Although exact values can be found by superimposing the two point loads at L/4 and 3L/4, a simpler bounding calculation (equating the total load to a single middle load) shows that a thickness around 34 mm should keep the maximum displacement in the 70%–90% range of the 1 mm limit, thereby maximizing the score. This thickness offers sufficient stiffness to maintain the vertical displacement below 1 mm while avoiding overdesign, striking a balance between material use and performance.', config=ConfigFile(Th=34.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.3397702396539058, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 48.538605664843686}
