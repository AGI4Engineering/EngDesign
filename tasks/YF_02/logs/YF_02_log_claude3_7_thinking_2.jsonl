{'completion_tokens': 5575, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I calculated the optimal thickness by using the beam deflection formula for a simply supported beam with two point loads. For a beam with length 1000 mm, width 40 mm, subjected to two 1000N loads at quarter-span positions, the maximum deflection is given by δ_max = (P·a·(3L²-4a²))/(24·E·I), where I = (w·Th³)/12. After substituting all values, I derived δ_max = 40,923.61/Th³. For the optimal 70-90% of the 1mm threshold, I need a thickness between 35.7 and 38.7 mm. I selected 37 mm as it provides an expected deflection of approximately 0.81 mm, placing it ideally in the middle of our target range.', config=ConfigFile(Th=37.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.28760058734985366, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 41.08579819283624}
