For a simply supported beam with two equal loads at quarter points, the maximum deflection occurs at the center and can be calculated using the formula: δ_max = (11·P·L³)/(32·E·w·Th³). To maximize the score, I aimed for a displacement of 0.8 mm (80% of the 1 mm threshold). After converting all units to a consistent system and solving for thickness, I calculated Th = 37.2 mm. I verified this by calculating the expected displacement with Th = 37 mm, which gave 0.808 mm (80.8% of threshold), confirming it falls well within the optimal 70-90% range for maximum points.', config=ConfigFile(Th=37.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'max_displacement_y': 0.28760058734985366, 'threshold': 1.0}, 'score': 41.08579819283624}
