Consequently we must attenuate\n   everything from 4 kHz upward before decimation.  Hence the stop-band is\n   required to start at 4 kHz.\n\nStep-3:  Pass-band specification\n   Useful band : 0 … 3.5 kHz (attenuation < 3 dB, ripple < 3 dB)\n   Transition   : 3.5 kHz … 4 kHz  ( 500-Hz transition width )\n\nStep-4:  FIR design method\n   A Hamming–windowed, truncated–sinc (linear-phase) FIR is chosen because\n   it guarantees exact linear phase and satisfies the modest ripple\n   requirement with a reasonable number of taps.\n   A prototype low-pass impulse response is\n        h_ideal[n] = 2·fc · sinc( 2·fc·(n-M) )\n   with   fc = (3.5 kHz + 4 kHz)/2 ÷ Fs_in ≈ 0.08 (normalised),\n   window w[n] is a length-31 Hamming window.\n   Order 30 (31 taps) meets the 3-dB pass-band criterion while providing\n   roughly 50-dB stop-band attenuation—adequate for speech-band audio.\n\nStep-5:  Final coefficients (31 taps, symmetric, DC gain ≈ 1)\n   The coefficients below are given in “feed-forward” (b[0] … b[30]) form.\n\nStep-6:  Summary of parameters returned in the JSON object\n   order  = 30          (#taps-1)\n   coeffs = list below\n   stpbnd = 4000        (Hz)\n   decim  = 6           (48 kHz → 8 kHz)', config=ConfigFile(order=30.0, coeffs=[0.0047, 0.0048, 0.0026, -0.0024, -0.0102, -0.0176, -0.023, -0.0226, -0.014, 0.0058, 0.0345, 0.0689, 0.1042, 0.1338, 0.154, 0.16, 0.154, 0.1338, 0.1042, 0.0689, 0.0345, 0.0058, -0.014, -0.0226, -0.023, -0.0176, -0.0102, -0.0024, 0.0026, 0.0048, 0.0047], stpbnd=4000.0, decim=6.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'order': 30.0, 'coefficients': [0.0047, 0.0048, 0.0026, -0.0024, -0.0102, -0.0176, -0.023, -0.0226, -0.014, 0.0058, 0.0345, 0.0689, 0.1042, 0.1338, 0.154, 0.16, 0.154, 0.1338, 0.1042, 0.0689, 0.0345, 0.0058, -0.014, -0.0226, -0.023, -0.0176, -0.0102, -0.0024, 0.0026, 0.0048, 0.0047], 'passband attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'stopband attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'transition band attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'order value reasonable': True, 'order and coefficient are properly related': True, 'stopband placement ok': True, 'decimation value ok': True}, 'score': 60}
