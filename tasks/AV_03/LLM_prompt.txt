## Task Description
In this task, you are required to design a system to downsample a digital audio signal from 48kHz to 8kHz. Before downsampling, we need an anti-aliasing filter. Design this filter.

### Design Constraints
The input signal is sampled at 48kHz.
The output signal is sampled at 8kHz.
The useful frequency bandwidth of the original signal is between 0 and 3.5kHz, and it must be preserved with minimal distortion (Attenuation less than 3dB, Ripple amplitude less than 3dB)
You must ensure that the useful frequency bandwidth is unaffected by aliasing. Thus, determine the beginning frequency of the stopband.
Ensure that your filter is FIR.

### Response Specifications
Provide the following information as your response.
- The filter order
- A list of the filter's coefficients
- The beginning frequency of the stopband
- The decimation factor
