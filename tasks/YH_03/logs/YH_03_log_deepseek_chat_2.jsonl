Using separate AXI interfaces for each matrix increases interface resources but provides maximum memory bandwidth. Fixing matrix sizes at compile-time enables better optimization but reduces flexibility. The pipelined implementation achieves high throughput but requires careful management of loop structure to maintain the desired initiation interval. These choices were justified by the target application's need for maximum throughput with fixed matrix sizes.\", conclusion='This implementation successfully creates a high-throughput GEMM operation optimized for the VCK5000 platform.
