Historically, GEMM has been optimized for CPUs and GPUs, yet modern FPGA platforms offer fine-grained parallelism and energy efficiency that can outperform traditional processors for tailored workloads. The Xilinx Alveo VCK5000 features a large array of DSP slices, block RAMs, and ultra-fast transceivers, making it an attractive target for high-throughput linear algebra acceleration. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) with Vitis HLS allows designers to describe hardware in C/C++ while applying pragmas for interface and pipeline control, drastically reducing development time compared to RTL design. Leveraging VCK5000\u2019s resources via Vitis HLS for GEMM can enable teraflop-class performance in a power-efficient manner.', objectives=['Implement a 1024\u00d71024\u00d71024 single-precision GEMM in C for Vitis HLS', 'Use AXI4 master interfaces for matrix data movement', 'Expose control registers via AXI4-Lite', 'Achieve an initiation interval (II) of 1 on the innermost multiply-accumulate loop', 'Optimize resource utilization for the VCK5000 target'], significance='Successful implementation of a fully pipelined GEMM on the VCK5000 board can deliver high throughput for AI inference, signal processing, and scientific workloads, reducing latency and power consumption compared to GPU or CPU based solutions.'), task_analysis=TaskAnalysis(task_description='The user requires a synthesizable C function with signature void gemm(float A[M_SIZE][K_SIZE], float B[K_SIZE][N_SIZE], float C[M_SIZE][N_SIZE]) where M_SIZE, K_SIZE, and N_SIZE are each defined as 1024. The design must use AXI4 master interfaces for matrices A, B, and C, each on separate bundles, and an AXI4-Lite slave interface for control and return.

We added #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi directives on each array argument and assigned them to distinct bundles (gmem0, gmem1, gmem2) to support concurrent memory transactions. Control ports and the return were mapped with #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite. We inserted #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1 before the innermost loop to ensure a new multiply-accumulate starts each cycle. We considered further optimizations such as loop tiling or unrolling but prioritized a minimal resource footprint given the large matrix size. The function was validated in C simulation, synthesized in Vitis HLS, and resource estimates were checked against VCK5000\u2019s DSP, LUT, and FF budgets.'), results=Results(parameters='Achieved an initiation interval of 1 for the k-loop, yielding a theoretical peak throughput of one multiply-accumulate per cycle.

Full unrolling of outer loops would exceed on-chip BRAM and DSP budgets, so we maintain the simple triple loop. Separate AXI bundles mitigate bank conflicts, but latency due to DDR access cannot be fully hidden without tiling and double-buffering. We chose a straightforward design to maximize clarity and resource efficiency on the VCK5000.', conclusion='A fully pipelined, synthesizable GEMM implementation for 1024\u00d71024 matrices on the VCK5000 board was achieved using Vitis HLS. The design meets the requirement of an initiation interval of 1 on the inner loop and uses separate AXI4 master interfaces for each matrix plus an AXI4-Lite interface for control. Resource estimates indicate the implementation fits well within the board\u2019s DSP, LUT, and FF budgets.
