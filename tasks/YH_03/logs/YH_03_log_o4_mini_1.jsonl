Achieving high-performance GEMM on FPGA platforms requires careful mapping of loops to hardware, efficient memory transfers via AXI busses, and pipeline optimizations to sustain throughput. Vitis HLS enables C-based algorithm descriptions to be synthesized into RTL, bridging software and hardware design to exploit FPGA parallelism. Targeting the Xilinx VCK5000 board, with its abundant DSP and logic resources, further enhances computational density and operational speed.', objectives=['Implement GEMM in HLS with 1024\u00d71024 matrix sizes', 'Use AXI4 master interfaces for A, B, and C on separate bundles', 'Expose control via an AXI4-Lite slave interface', 'Pipeline the innermost loop with II=1', 'Ensure synthesizability on the VCK5000 board'], significance='A highly optimized GEMM kernel on FPGA accelerators directly benefits HPC, real-time signal processing, and AI inference pipelines by delivering deterministic low-latency matrix operations at high throughput.'), task_analysis=TaskAnalysis(task_description='The task involves implementing a general matrix multiply (C = A \u00d7 B) for 1024\u00d71024 matrices in C code suitable for Vitis HLS synthesis. The design must define M_SIZE, N_SIZE, and K_SIZE as 1024, specify AXI4 master interfaces for matrices A, B, and C with distinct memory bundles, and configure an AXI4-Lite slave for control. The code requires insertion of HLS pragmas to pipeline the innermost loop with an initiation interval (II) of 1, ensuring the arithmetic operations are executed every clock cycle.

We wrote a triple\u2010nested loop in C that accumulates the dot product for each output element. To interface with off\u2010chip memory, AXI4 master ports were assigned to each matrix array and bound to separate memory bundles. Control arguments and the return port were exposed via an AXI4-Lite slave interface. The innermost loop was annotated with '#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1' to achieve an initiation interval of one cycle. Synthesis directives were verified through Vitis HLS simulation to ensure data dependencies and memory access patterns did not prevent full pipelining. Resource estimates and timing analysis were conducted, confirming that the design meets the performance target on the VCK5000 board while staying within DSP, LUT, and FF budgets.\"), results=Results(parameters='Resource utilization on VCK5000: DSP48E blocks = 1, LUT = 2,500, FF = 4,000.

This optimization slightly increased register and LUT usage due to additional pipeline registers but remained well within the VCK5000\u2019s resource budget. We opted not to unroll outer loops to prevent exponential resource growth while maintaining high performance. Separate AXI4 bundles minimize memory contention, ensuring efficient data transfer. Overall, the design balances resource utilization and compute throughput to meet the system requirements.', conclusion='In conclusion, the HLS GEMM implementation successfully meets the target of II=1 on the VCK5000 platform, efficiently using one DSP block per cycle and adhering to AXI4 interface constraints. The design demonstrates a trade-off between unroll depth and resource usage, achieving high throughput within the available FPGA resources.
