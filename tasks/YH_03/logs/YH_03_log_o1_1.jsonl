Historically, with the advent of specialized hardware accelerators, many industries shifted toward optimizing GEMM on FPGA platforms for high throughput. This methodology has gained momentum since FPGAs can exploit parallelism and specialized dataflow architectures more efficiently than general-purpose CPUs. By tailoring the hardware to the mathematical operations required, one can drastically reduce computation time and energy consumption. Over the years, accelerated GEMM computations have been applied in real-time systems, embedded devices, and data centers, often fueling performance improvements in areas like neural network training, seismic data analysis, and cryptographic transformations. Furthermore, the broad availability of FPGA boards has advanced this field by enabling designers and researchers to fine-tune hardware pipelines specifically for matrix multiplication, leading to ever-higher performance gains and opening the door to more complex applications and large-scale data analytics. With each generation of FPGA architecture providing more resources and improved clock speeds, the feasibility of large matrix operations in real-time continues to increase, reinforcing the relevance of GEMM for future computing needs.', objectives=['Implement a high-throughput GEMM kernel on an FPGA using Vitis HLS', 'Leverage pipeline parallelism for performance', 'Prove feasibility on a modern FPGA board such as VCK5000'], significance='The successful design of an FPGA-accelerated GEMM kernel enables faster data processing across numerous industries, from AI to scientific simulation.

This requires a thorough understanding of how to decompose the matrix multiplication operation into a pipeline-friendly structure using nested loops. The design must adhere to specific constraints, including resource limitations on the FPGA and the necessity of using AXI4 master interfaces for memory transactions. By defining M_SIZE, N_SIZE, and K_SIZE at 1024, the design targets a substantial computation load that tests both the performance and resource handling of the FPGA. The M_AXI interface must be assigned for reading data from arrays A and B, as well as writing results into array C, while an AXI4-Lite interface for control and configuration must be implemented. Additionally, it is crucial to maintain a pipeline initiation interval (II) of 1 in the innermost loop to ensure maximal throughput and minimal stalls during computation. Effective scheduling, resource allocation, and loop unrolling strategies must be considered to meet or exceed performance targets without exceeding resource availability.

Next, the algorithm was structured in nested loops, with the outer two loops iterating over the output matrix dimensions (M and N) and the innermost loop computing the dot product for each entry. By placing a pipeline pragma (II=1) in the innermost loop, concurrency is maximized as each iteration can be initiated before the previous one completes, significantly enhancing throughput. The AXI4 master interfaces allow the gemm function to read from matrix A and B and write to matrix C. Meanwhile, the AXI4-Lite interface ensures straightforward management of function invocation and parameter passing. The final code was validated for correctness through C-simulation, verifying that the large matrix multiplication produced the expected results. Subsequently, C-synthesis and place-and-route steps were performed, confirming that the design fit within the FPGA's resource budget.
