Historically, as demand for high-performance computing has grown, efficient implementations of matrix multiplication have become increasingly critical to support real-time operations. In hardware accelerators like FPGAs, specialized pipelines and parallel data paths dramatically improve throughput while reducing power consumption relative to standard CPUs. Over the decades, research has focused on refining arithmetic structures and memory hierarchies to reduce bottlenecks in large-scale computations. Today, FPGA-based GEMM implementations find utility in accelerators for data centers and edge devices, underscoring their importance in core computational tasks. This design addresses the requirement for a robust GEMM accelerator capable of handling 1024\u00d71024 matrix dimensions, ensuring optimal use of DSP blocks and leveraging advanced pipelined architectures to deliver maximum throughput while respecting resource constraints and data bandwidth requirements.', objectives=['Implement a pipelined GEMM on FPGA', 'Optimize resource utilization for large matrix dimensions', 'Ensure compatibility with the VCK5000 platform', 'Provide high-throughput computing performance'], significance='An efficient GEMM implementation enables a wide range of computationally intensive tasks, from AI training to real-time signal processing, significantly impacting industries relying on massive data handling.'), task_analysis=TaskAnalysis(task_description='This task requires designing a high-throughput matrix multiplication module (GEMM) for matrices sized up to 1024\u00d71024 on the VCK5000 board. Such large matrices emphasize the need to manage internal data transfers efficiently and to utilize the FPGA\u2019s DSP, LUT, and register resources effectively. The design must adopt a robust pipelining structure to keep all compute resources fully engaged, minimizing idle cycles. By interfacing with AXI4 master ports for memory transactions and an AXI4-Lite control interface, the module can be easily integrated into larger systems. Resource considerations include ensuring that the available DSP slices, LUTs, and FFs on the VCK5000 are sufficient for a fully unrolled or well-optimized design. The solution must also maintain a flexible pipeline initiation interval, ideally an II of 1 in the innermost loop, to maximize concurrency.

Using Vitis HLS, we define our function with strict AXI4 master ports for all large matrices and an AXI4-Lite slave port for control. We rely on loops with HLS PIPELINE pragmas, particularly ensuring an initiation interval (II) of 1 to maximize throughput in the innermost loop. We also explore blocking or tiling strategies for extremely large matrices to optimize memory bandwidth and reduce stalls. Resource usage analyses guide us to balance parallelism and practical DSP usage so the design remains feasible within the constraints of the VCK5000. Optional vectorization or further unrolling can be considered if the resource budget allows.
