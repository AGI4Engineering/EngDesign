Historically, optimized implementations on CPUs and GPUs have leveraged vectorization and parallel architectures to achieve high throughput. With the emergence of reconfigurable systems, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer energy-efficient and customizable pipelines that can be tailored to domain-specific operations. The Vitis HLS design environment further streamlines hardware development by allowing high-level C/C++ descriptions to be synthesized into FPGA IP, reducing development time. In this context, implementing a pipelined GEMM (General Matrix Multiply) kernel on the Xilinx VCK5000 board aims to bridge software productivity with hardware acceleration, unlocking high-bandwidth memory interfaces and deep pipeline parallelism to accelerate large-scale matrix operations.', objectives=['Develop a pipelined GEMM kernel using Vitis HLS', 'Achieve an initiation interval (II) of 1 for the inner multiply-accumulate loop', 'Use AXI4 master interfaces for A, B, and C matrices with separate bundles', 'Employ an AXI4-Lite slave interface for control and return'], significance='High-performance matrix multiplication accelerators are critical for real-time data analytics, AI inference, and scientific simulations.

An AXI4-Lite slave interface is attached for host-driven control. Inside the function, three nested loops traverse the output rows and columns, accumulating the dot product. The innermost loop incorporates #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1 to achieve an initiation interval of one, fully pipelining the multiply-accumulate operations.
