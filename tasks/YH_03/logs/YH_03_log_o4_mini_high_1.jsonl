Historically, CPUs and GPUs have been optimized with vector units and specialized hardware blocks to accelerate this operation. However, the emergence of modern FPGA platforms, such as Xilinx VCK5000, has enabled designers to implement highly specialized, deeply pipelined, and parallel dataflow architectures tailored to specific problem sizes. Vitis HLS provides a high-level synthesis toolchain that can translate C/C++ specifications directly into optimized hardware, significantly reducing development time compared to traditional RTL methodologies. In this project, we target a 1024x1024 GEMM accelerator in C, achieving high throughput by exploiting AXI4 interfaces and loop pipelining. The context and motivation for this design stem from the need to accelerate compute-intensive workloads with tight latency and power budgets.', objectives=['Implement a 1024x1024 matrix multiplication (GEMM) accelerator using Vitis HLS', 'Optimize data movement using AXI4 master interfaces for external memory access', 'Achieve an initiation interval (II) of 1 via pipelined design pragmas', 'Target the design to a VCK5000 FPGA board with resource and performance constraints'], significance='Accelerating matrix multiplication on FPGA hardware can provide significant performance and energy efficiency benefits for applications in machine learning inference, scientific computing, and real-time analytics.

The function must be compatible with Vitis HLS and target the VCK5000 FPGA platform. Specific requirements include defining matrix dimensions via #define statements, configuring AXI4 master interfaces for external DDR memory access on matrices A, B, and C, and an AXI4-Lite slave interface for control and return. Additionally, the inner computation loop must be fully pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 to maximize throughput while respecting hardware resource constraints.

The innermost loop is pipelined with II=1 to allow back-to-back operations each cycle. AXI4 master pragmas are applied to the A, B, and C arguments to generate burst-capable interfaces, enabling high-bandwidth external memory access on the VCK5000 board. An AXI4-Lite slave interface is configured to allow CPU-based control of the accelerator function. We analyze loop bounds, memory access patterns, and resource usage to avoid HLS bottlenecks.

The key compromise involved balancing on-chip resource utilization\u2014particularly DSP slices\u2014against achievable throughput. By streaming data through AXI4 master interfaces with burst transactions, memory bottlenecks were reduced. However, complete unrolling of loops was avoided to maintain a DSP budget suitable for the VCK5000. The use of AXI4-Lite for control simplified host communication but introduced minor latency overheads during kernel invocation.', conclusion='The resulting design achieves a sustained throughput of roughly 1.07e9 floating-point operations per second at a 300 MHz target frequency, using 1024 DSP slices and moderate LUT and FF resources. The II=1 pipelined architecture ensures high utilization of hardware compute elements, while the AXI4 master interfaces provide efficient data movement. This implementation demonstrates the feasibility of mapping large-scale GEMM kernels onto the VCK5000 board with Vitis HLS, meeting both performance and resource constraints.
