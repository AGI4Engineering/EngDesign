Using full loop unrolling would provide maximum performance but exceed the VCK5000's resources. Instead, we opted for pipelining the innermost loop with partial unrolling. This provides good throughput while staying within resource constraints. The AXI4 interface width was chosen to match the VCK5000's memory subsystem for optimal bandwidth utilization.\", conclusion=\"This implementation successfully creates a high-performance GEMM operation optimized for the VCK5000 board. The design demonstrates how HLS can be used to create efficient hardware implementations of matrix operations. The pipelined approach provides good throughput while maintaining reasonable resource utilization.
