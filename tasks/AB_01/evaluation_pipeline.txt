We manually input the 5 values returned by the LLM into the evaluation script.

The script computes ground truth values from the fixed image matrix and ROI polygon.

Each LLM value is compared to the reference with a tolerance of 1e-4.

Each correct match earns 20 points, for a total score out of 100.

All 5 correct = pass. Less than 5 correct = fail.
