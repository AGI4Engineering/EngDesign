{'completion_tokens': 2067, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The task is to calculate several radiomics features from a given image patch and a polygonal region of interest (ROI).\n\nStep 1: Define Image Patch and ROI.\nThe image patch is a 10x10 matrix of intensity values. The ROI is defined by vertices (2,2), (2,7), (7,7), (7,2). These are (row, column) coordinates, 0-indexed.\n\nStep 2: Identify pixels strictly inside the ROI.\nThe ROI is a rectangle. The minimum row index of a vertex is 2, maximum row index is 7. The minimum column index of a vertex is 2, maximum column index is 7.\nFor a pixel at (r, c) to be strictly inside this polygon, its coordinates must satisfy `2 < r < 7` and `2 < c < 7`.\nThus, interior rows are `r = 3, 4, 5, 6`.\nInterior columns are `c = 3, 4, 5, 6`.\nThis defines a 4x4 block of pixels within the original image patch.\n\nStep 3: Extract intensity values of interior pixels.\nThe interior pixels are those from `image[3:7, 3:7]` (using Python-like slicing for rows 3,4,5,6 and columns 3,4,5,6).\nFrom the provided image patch:\n`image[3][3..6]` = `[30, 33, 36, 39]`\n`image[4][3..6]` = `[32, 35, 38, 41]`\n`image[5][3..6]` = `[34, 37, 40, 43]`\n`image[6][3..6]` = `[36, 39, 42, 45]`\nThese 16 intensity values form the set `X = [30, 33, 36, 39, 32, 35, 38, 41, 34, 37, 40, 43, 36, 39, 42, 45]`.\nThe number of interior pixels is `N = 16`.\n\nStep 4: Calculate first-order statistics.\n*   Mean (`mu`): `sum(X) / N`\n    `sum(X) = 30+33+36+39+32+35+38+41+34+37+40+43+36+39+42+45 = 600`\n    `Mean = 600 / 16 = 37.5`\n*   Variance (sample, `s^2`): `sum((X_i - mu)^2) / (N-1)`\n    The deviations `(X_i - mu)` are: `[-7.5, -4.5, -1.5, 1.5, -5.5, -2.5, 0.5, 3.5, -3.5, -0.5, 2.5, 5.5, -1.5, 1.5, 4.5, 7.5]`.\n    The sum of squared deviations `sum((X_i - mu)^2) = 260`.\n    `Variance = 260 / (16 - 1) = 260 / 15 = 17.333333...`\n    Rounded to 4 decimal places: `17.3333`.\n*   Skewness: Calculated as `(1/N) * sum(((X_i - mu) / sigma_pop)^3)`, where `sigma_pop = sqrt(sum((X_i - mu)^2) / N)` is the population standard deviation.\n    `sigma_pop^2 = 260 / 16 = 16.25`.\n    The distribution of `(X_i - mu)` values is perfectly symmetric around 0 (e.g., -7.5 and 7.5 occur, -1.5 and 1.5 occur twice each). Due to this symmetry, the sum of the cubed normalized deviations is 0.\n    `Skewness = 0 / 16 = 0`.\n*   Kurtosis (Fisher's, excess): Calculated as `((1/N) * sum(((X_i - mu) / sigma_pop)^4)) - 3`. This is equivalent to `(mu_4 / mu_2^2) - 3`, where `mu_k` is the k-th central moment.\n    `mu_2 = sigma_pop^2 = 16.25`.\n    `sum((X_i - mu)^4) = 9377.0` (exact sum as all `X_i-mu` are multiples of 0.5).\n    `mu_4 = sum((X_i - mu)^4) / N = 9377.0 / 16 = 586.0625`.\n    Pearson's Kurtosis = `mu_4 / mu_2^2 = 586.0625 / (16.25^2) = 586.0625 / 264.0625 = 9377 / 4225 = 2.21940828...`.\n    `Excess Kurtosis = (9377 / 4225) - 3 = -3298 / 4225 = -0.78059171...`.\n    Rounded to 4 decimal places: `-0.7806`.\n\nStep 5: Construct GLCM and calculate Contrast.\nThe matrix of interior pixel intensities, `P_ROI`, is:\n    `[[30, 33, 36, 39],`\n     `[32, 35, 38, 41],`\n     `[34, 37, 40, 43],`\n     `[36, 39, 42, 45]]`\nGLCM is constructed using horizontal adjacency (offset `[0, 1]`, distance=1, angle=0 degrees). Pairs are `(P_ROI[r][c], P_ROI[r][c+1])` where both pixels are inside the ROI.\nThere are `4 rows * (4-1 columns for first element) = 12` such pairs.\nThese pairs are:\n    Row 1: `(30,33), (33,36), (36,39)`\n    Row 2: `(32,35), (35,38), (38,41)`\n    Row 3: `(34,37), (37,40), (40,43)`\n    Row 4: `(36,39), (39,42), (42,45)`\nThe GLCM counts are: `p(30,33)=1/12`, `p(33,36)=1/12`, `p(36,39)=2/12` (from row 1 and row 4), `p(32,35)=1/12`, `p(35,38)=1/12`, `p(38,41)=1/12`, `p(34,37)=1/12`, `p(37,40)=1/12`, `p(40,43)=1/12`, `p(39,42)=1/12`, `p(42,45)=1/12`. All other `p(i,j)=0`. The sum of these probabilities is 1.\n\nCalculate Contrast: $Contrast = \\sum_{i,j} |i-j|^2 p(i,j)$.\nFor all contributing pairs `(i,j)` in this specific GLCM, `j - i = 3`. Thus, `|i-j|^2 = 3^2 = 9` for all these pairs.\n`Contrast = \\sum 9 * p(i,j) = 9 * (\\sum p(i,j))`.\nSince `\\sum p(i,j) = 1` for a normalized GLCM,\n`Contrast = 9 * 1 = 9`.", config=RadiomicsOutput(mean=37.5, variance=17.3333, skewness=0.0, kurtosis=-0.7806, contrast=9.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': 'Mean intensity value of the ROI is wrong.\nSample variance of intensity values in the ROI is wrong.\nSkewness of intensity distribution in the ROI is correct.\nExcess kurtosis of intensity distribution in the ROI is wrong.\nGLCM contrast feature computed from ROI pixels is correct.\n', 'score': 40}
