{'completion_tokens': 350, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To solve this task, we followed these steps:\n\n1. **Identify interior pixels**: The given polygon vertices (2,2), (2,7), (7,7), (7,2) form a rectangle. All pixels strictly inside this rectangle (rows 3-6, columns 3-6 in 1-based indexing) are interior pixels.\n\n2. **Extract intensity values**: The intensities of the interior pixels form a 5x5 matrix from the original 10x10 matrix, with values ranging from 25 to 47.\n\n3. **Calculate first-order statistics**:\n   - **Mean**: Sum of all intensities divided by the number of pixels (25).\n   - **Variance**: Sample variance using N-1 denominator.\n   - **Skewness**: Third standardized moment.\n   - **Kurtosis**: Excess kurtosis (fourth standardized moment minus 3).\n\n4. **Construct GLCM**: For interior pixels, we computed the co-occurrence matrix for horizontally adjacent pairs (offset [0,1]), then normalized it.\n\n5. **Calculate Contrast**: Using the formula ∑|i-j|² p(i,j) on the normalized GLCM.\n\nAll calculations were performed numerically and results rounded to 4 decimal places.', config=RadiomicsOutput(mean=36.0, variance=52.0, skewness=0.0, kurtosis=-1.2689, contrast=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': 'Mean intensity value of the ROI is wrong.\nSample variance of intensity values in the ROI is wrong.\nSkewness of intensity distribution in the ROI is correct.\nExcess kurtosis of intensity distribution in the ROI is wrong.\nGLCM contrast feature computed from ROI pixels is wrong.\n', 'score': 20}
