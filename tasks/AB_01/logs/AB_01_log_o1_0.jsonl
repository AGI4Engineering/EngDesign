{'completion_tokens': 11671, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1) Polygon Interior Pixels:\n   The rectangle with corners at (2,2),(2,7),(7,7),(7,2) excludes its boundary rows and columns when taking strictly “inside” pixels.  Hence the interior coordinates are:\n       (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6),\n       (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6),\n       (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6),\n       (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n   \n2) Intensities of Interior Pixels:\n   From the image patch, these coordinates yield:\n       Row=3 → 30, 33, 36, 39\n       Row=4 → 32, 35, 38, 41\n       Row=5 → 34, 37, 40, 43\n       Row=6 → 36, 39, 42, 45\n   \n3) First-Order Statistics:\n   - Mean = (sum of all interior intensities) / 16 = 600 / 16 = 37.5\n   - Variance (sample) = [Σ(x-mean)²] / (16-1) = 260 / 15 = 17.3333...\n   - Skewness: The sum of (x-mean)³ over all interior pixels is zero (the distribution is symmetric about the mean), so skewness = 0.\n   - Kurtosis (excess, Fisher) is computed as [(1 / (n·s⁴)) Σ(x-mean)⁴ ] - 3.  The sum of (x-mean)⁴ = 9377, and s² = 17.3333...  Numerically it yields about -1.0493.\n   \n4) GLCM Construction (Offset [0,1]) for Interior Pixels:\n   Considering horizontal neighbors within each of the 4 interior rows, we obtain 12 intensity pairs.  All have intensity differences of 3.  After normalization, the sum of GLCM probabilities = 1.\n   \n5) Contrast from GLCM:\n   Contrast = Σ(i,j) (|i - j|² · p(i,j)).  Since every pair has |i - j| = 3, we get |3|² = 9, multiplied by the total probability = 1, so Contrast = 9.\n   \nFinal Rounded Values (4 decimals):\n   Mean: 37.5000\n   Variance: 17.3333\n   Skewness: 0.0000\n   Kurtosis: -1.0493\n   Contrast: 9.0000', config=RadiomicsOutput(mean=37.5, variance=17.3333, skewness=0.0, kurtosis=-1.0493, contrast=9.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': 'Mean intensity value of the ROI is wrong.\nSample variance of intensity values in the ROI is wrong.\nSkewness of intensity distribution in the ROI is correct.\nExcess kurtosis of intensity distribution in the ROI is wrong.\nGLCM contrast feature computed from ROI pixels is correct.\n', 'score': 40}
