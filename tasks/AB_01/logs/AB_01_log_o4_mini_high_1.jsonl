"Strictly inside" means integer pixel centers with row>2 and row<7 (i.e. rows 3,4,5,6) and col>2 and col<7 (cols 3,4,5,6).\n2. Collect interior pixel intensities from the 10×10 patch:\n   Row 3 (0-based): cols 3–6 → [30, 33, 36, 39]\n   Row 4:                  → [32, 35, 38, 41]\n   Row 5:                  → [34, 37, 40, 43]\n   Row 6:                  → [36, 39, 42, 45]\n   Flattened list (16 values):\n     [30, 33, 36, 39, 32, 35, 38, 41, 34, 37, 40, 43, 36, 39, 42, 45]\n3.
