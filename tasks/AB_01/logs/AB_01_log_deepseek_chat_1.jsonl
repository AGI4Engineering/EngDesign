We identified all pixels strictly inside this rectangle (rows 3-6, columns 3-6 in 1-based indexing or 2-5 in 0-based).\n\n2. **Extract intensities**: The interior pixels' intensities form a 4x4 matrix with values from 25 to 48.\n\n3. **Calculate first-order statistics**:\n   - **Mean**: Calculated as the average of all interior pixel intensities.\n   - **Variance**: Computed using sample variance (N-1 denominator).\n   - **Skewness**: Calculated as the third standardized moment.\n   - **Kurtosis**: Computed as the fourth standardized moment minus 3 (excess kurtosis).\n\n4. **Construct GLCM**: Created a co-occurrence matrix for horizontally adjacent interior pixels, then normalized it.\n\n5. **Calculate Contrast**: Applied the formula to the normalized GLCM to get the contrast feature.\n\nAll calculations were performed numerically and results rounded to 4 decimal places.", config=RadiomicsOutput(mean=36.5, variance=74.6667, skewness=0.0, kurtosis=-1.2, contrast=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': 'Mean intensity value of the ROI is wrong.\nSample variance of intensity values in the ROI is wrong.\nSkewness of intensity distribution in the ROI is correct.\nExcess kurtosis of intensity distribution in the ROI is wrong.\nGLCM contrast feature computed from ROI pixels is wrong.\n', 'score': 20}
