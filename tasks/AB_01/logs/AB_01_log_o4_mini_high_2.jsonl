{'completion_tokens': 10218, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Determine ROI interior: the polygon with vertices (2,2), (2,7), (7,7), (7,2) yields all integer pixel centers strictly inside the rectangle: rows 3–6 and columns 3–6 (4×4 = 16 pixels).\n2. Extract intensities at those coordinates: [30, 33, 36, 39,\n                                  32, 35, 38, 41,\n                                  34, 37, 40, 43,\n                                  36, 39, 42, 45]. Sum = 600.\n3. Mean = 600 / 16 = 37.5.\n4. Compute squared deviations: di = xi – 37.5, Σ di² = 260 → sample variance = 260 / (16 – 1) = 17.3333.\n5. Compute cubic deviations Σ di³ = 0 → skewness = 0 / ( (260/16)^(3/2) ) = 0.0000.\n6. Compute quartic deviations Σ di⁴ = 9377 → m4 = 9377/16 = 586.0625, m2 = 260/16 = 16.25 → kurtosis = (586.0625 / 16.25²) – 3 ≈ –0.7805.\n7. Build GLCM for horizontal offset [0,1]: there are 12 adjacent pairs, each with |i–j| = 3 → |i–j|² = 9. Normalized probabilities sum to 1 → contrast = 9.\n8.
