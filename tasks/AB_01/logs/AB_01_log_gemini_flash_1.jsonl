{'completion_tokens': 1303, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. **Identify Interior Pixels:** The ROI is a rectangle defined by vertices (2,2), (2,7), (7,7), and (7,2). The interior pixels have row indices from 3 to 6 inclusive, and column indices from 3 to 6 inclusive. Thus, interior pixels are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n2. **Extract Intensities:**  Extract the intensity values corresponding to these coordinates from the image patch:\n   `[[30, 33, 36, 39],\n     [32, 35, 38, 41],\n     [34, 37, 40, 43],\n     [36, 39, 42, 45]]`\n\nThis gives us the intensity values: `[30, 33, 36, 39, 32, 35, 38, 41, 34, 37, 40, 43, 36, 39, 42, 45]`\n3. **Calculate First-Order Statistics:**\n   - Mean: (30+33+36+39+32+35+38+41+34+37+40+43+36+39+42+45)/16 = 37.5\n   - Variance:  Calculate the variance using the sample variance formula (N-1 denominator). The sum of squared differences from the mean is:\n     (30-37.5)^2 + (33-37.5)^2 + ... + (45-37.5)^2 = 386.0\n     Variance = 386.0 / (16-1) = 25.7333\n   - Skewness:  Calculate the skewness.  Sum of cubed deviations from the mean divided by (n-1)*std_dev^3 = ((-7.5)^3 + (-4.5)^3 + (-1.5)^3 + (1.5)^3 + (-5.5)^3 + (-2.5)^3 + (0.5)^3 + (3.5)^3 + (-3.5)^3 + (-0.5)^3 + (2.5)^3 + (5.5)^3 + (-1.5)^3 + (1.5)^3 + (4.5)^3 + (7.5)^3 )/ (15 * sqrt(25.7333)^3) = 0\n   - Kurtosis: Calculate the excess kurtosis. Sum of fourth power deviations from mean, divided by (n-1)*std_dev^4, minus 3.\n    ((30-37.5)^4 + (33-37.5)^4 + ... (45-37.5)^4)/(15*25.7333^2) - 3= -1.3267\n4. **Construct GLCM:** Considering only horizontal adjacency within the ROI intensities: \n    Pairs: (30, 33), (33, 36), (36, 39), (32, 35), (35, 38), (38, 41), (34, 37), (37, 40), (40, 43), (36, 39), (39, 42), (42, 45)\n   Construct the GLCM based on these pairs. Need to map intensity levels to matrix indices. Intensities range from 30 to 45, so map 30->0, 31->1, ... 45->15. GLCM has size 16x16. \n   Populate the GLCM with counts. Then normalize by dividing by the total number of pairs (12).\n   Instead of constructing a full GLCM and normalizing, we will use the intensities directly and assume that is how it will be used and skip the quantization step. Then we directly apply the contrast formula. \n5. **Calculate Contrast:**\n   - Using direct intensities, the GLCM pairs from step 4 can be used. The sum of |i-j|^2 * p(i,j) is approximated as the average squared difference between pairs, because the GLCM will have the same value on each considered pair with its normalized entry. Calculate the average squared difference:\n    ((33-30)^2 + (36-33)^2 + (39-36)^2 + (35-32)^2 + (38-35)^2 + (41-38)^2 + (37-34)^2 + (40-37)^2 + (43-40)^2 + (39-36)^2 + (42-39)^2 + (45-42)^2) / 12 = (9*12)/12 = 9\nTherefore, the contrast value is 9.\n', config=RadiomicsOutput(mean=37.5, variance=25.7333, skewness=0.0, kurtosis=-1.3267, contrast=9.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': 'Mean intensity value of the ROI is wrong.\nSample variance of intensity values in the ROI is wrong.\nSkewness of intensity distribution in the ROI is correct.\nExcess kurtosis of intensity distribution in the ROI is wrong.\nGLCM contrast feature computed from ROI pixels is correct.\n', 'score': 40}
