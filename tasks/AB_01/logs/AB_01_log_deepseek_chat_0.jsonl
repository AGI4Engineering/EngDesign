We identified all pixels strictly inside this rectangle (rows 3-6, columns 3-6 in 1-based indexing or rows 2-6, columns 2-6 in 0-based).\n\n2. **Extract Intensity Values**: We extracted the intensity values of these interior pixels from the given 10x10 matrix.\n\n3. **Calculate First-Order Statistics**:\n   - **Mean**: Calculated as the average of all intensity values.\n   - **Variance**: Computed using sample variance (N-1 denominator).\n   - **Skewness**: Measured the asymmetry of the intensity distribution.\n   - **Kurtosis**: Calculated excess kurtosis (Fisher's definition).\n\n4. **Construct GLCM**: We built the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix for horizontal adjacency (offset [0,1]), considering only pairs where both pixels are inside the polygon, then normalized it.\n\n5. **Calculate GLCM Contrast**: Computed using the formula ∑|i-j|² p(i,j) on the normalized GLCM.\n\nAll calculations were performed numerically and results rounded to 4 decimal places.", config=RadiomicsOutput(mean=35.0, variance=52.5, skewness=0.0, kurtosis=-1.2, contrast=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': 'Mean intensity value of the ROI is correct.\nSample variance of intensity values in the ROI is wrong.\nSkewness of intensity distribution in the ROI is correct.\nExcess kurtosis of intensity distribution in the ROI is wrong.\nGLCM contrast feature computed from ROI pixels is wrong.\n', 'score': 40}
