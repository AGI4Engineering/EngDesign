For the `delete` operation, the function signature and detailed docstring are explicitly provided in the \\'Task\\' section of the problem description. This Python code block is converted into a JSON string. Newlines within the code/docstring are represented as `\\\\n`. Double quotes appearing inside the Python code (e.g., in `OSError(\"Directory not empty\")` or the `\"\"\"` docstring delimiters) are escaped as `\\\\\"` to ensure the entire block is a valid JSON string value.\\n2. For the `read`, `write`, and `create` operations, their definitions are not present in the main task text. Instead, the `example` fields within the provided JSON schema for `ConfigFile` properties (`read`, `write`, `create`) offer suitable definitions. These example strings are used directly as they are already correctly formatted JSON strings representing Python function signatures and docstrings.\\n3.
