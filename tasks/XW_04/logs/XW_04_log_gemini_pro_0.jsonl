The schema defines a `ConfigFile` object with `read`, `write`, `create`, and `delete` operations, each represented as a string containing Python code.\n1. For the `delete` operation: The input text under '### Task' provides a specific Python function signature, a detailed docstring, and a placeholder for implementation (`# Your implementation here…`). This is extracted and used for the `delete` field.\n2. For the `read`, `write`, and `create` operations: The input text does not provide explicit implementations or signatures for these functions. However, the JSON schema itself provides example Python code snippets for `read`, `write`, and `create` in their respective `example` fields. Since these fields are required by the `ConfigFile` schema and no other source is provided in the input, these example snippets are used. The code is extracted from the markdown-like triple backticks format shown in the schema's `example` fields.\n3.
