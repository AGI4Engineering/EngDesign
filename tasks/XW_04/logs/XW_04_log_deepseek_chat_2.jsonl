{'completion_tokens': 1715, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To implement the `delete` function for the filesystem image, we need to follow the specified steps carefully. Here's the detailed reasoning process:\n\n1. **Path Splitting**: The path is split into `parent_path` and `name` to identify the parent directory and the target entry to delete.\n2. **Parent Directory Lookup**: We need to traverse the filesystem to find the parent directory. If it doesn't exist or isn't a directory, appropriate errors are raised.\n3. **Target Entry Lookup**: Within the parent directory, we search for an entry matching the `name`. If not found, raise `FileNotFoundError`.\n4. **Target Inode Inspection**: Check if the target is a directory. If it's a non-empty directory, raise `OSError`. If it's a file or empty directory, proceed to free resources.\n5. **Resource Reclamation**: For files, free all data blocks referenced by the inode. For directories, ensure it's empty before removing.\n6. **Cleanup**: Remove the inode from `inodes` and the directory entry from the parent's directory list.\n7. **Return**: Return the mutated `FileSystemImage`.\n\nThis ensures the filesystem's integrity is maintained while correctly performing the deletion operation.", config=ConfigFile(read='def read(fs_img: FileSystemImage, name: str, pos: int, length: int) -> str:\n    """Read up to `length` bytes from file `name` starting at offset `pos`."""', write='def write(fs_img: FileSystemImage, name: str, pos: int, data: str) -> FileSystemImage:\n    """Write UTFâ€‘8 bytes of `data` into file `name` at offset `pos` and return the updated image."""', create='def create(fs_img: FileSystemImage, path: str, is_dir: bool = False) -> FileSystemImage:\n    """Create a new file or directory at `path`, returning the mutated image."""', delete='def delete(fs_img: FileSystemImage, path: str) -> FileSystemImage:\n    """Delete the entry at `path` and return the updated image."""')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'delete': False, 'delete_nested': False, 'delete_parent': False, 'fnf_error': False, 'not_directory_error': False, 'dir_not_empty_error': False}, 'score': 0}
