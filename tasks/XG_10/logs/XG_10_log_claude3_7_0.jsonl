Let me recalculate more carefully.\n\nFor the denominator, we indeed have s in the denominator, so it should be [1, 0].\nFor the numerator, we have 1.711s + 2.705, which corresponds to [1.711, 2.705].\n\n## Task 2: Adding Roll-Off Filter\n\nNow I need to enhance noise rejection by adding a first-order roll-off filter:\nKr(s) = (ωr·√(βr² + 1))/(s + βr·ωr)\n\nThe final controller will be:\nK2(s) = K1(s) · Kr(s) = ((1.711·s + 2.705)/s) · ((ωr·√(βr² + 1))/(s + βr·ωr))\n\nTo determine appropriate values of ωr and βr, I need to ensure that the standard deviation of the control signal σu ≤ 0.02.\n\nThe roll-off filter is typically set to have a cutoff frequency higher than the bandwidth but not too high to avoid amplifying noise. A common approach is to set ωr to be 2-3 times the bandwidth.\n\nLet's try ωr = 15 rad/s (3 times the bandwidth of 5 rad/s).\n\nFor βr, a value of 1 would give a standard first-order filter. However, to reduce sensitivity to noise further, I'll use βr = 2, which will provide a steeper roll-off.\n\nSo my chosen parameters are:\n- ωr = 15 rad/s\n- βr = 2\n\nThese values should provide sufficient noise attenuation while maintaining good tracking performance. The roll-off filter will reduce the high-frequency gain of the controller, thereby limiting the controller's response to high-frequency measurement noise.\n\nTo summarize:\n- PI controller K1(s) = (1.711·s + 2.705)/s\n  - Numerator: [1.711, 2.705]\n  - Denominator: [1, 0]\n- Roll-off filter parameters: ωr = 15, βr = 2", config=ConfigFile(K1_num=[1.711, 2.705], K1_den=[1.0, 0.0], omega_r=15.0, beta_r=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'K1_num': 'incorrect', 'K1_den': 'incorrect', 'noise_rejection': 'fullfilled'}, 'score': 60.0}
