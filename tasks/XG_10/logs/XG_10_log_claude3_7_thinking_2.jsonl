First, compute the gain Kg based on the plant G(s) = 3/(s + 2) at the desired bandwidth ωL = 5 rad/s:\n   |G(jωL)| = |3/(j5 + 2)| = 3/√(5² + 2²) = 3/√29 ≈ 0.557\n   Kg = 1/|G(jωL)| = 1/0.557 ≈ 1.795\n\n2. Design the integral-boost element with ωb = ωL = 5 and βb = √10 ≈ 3.162:\n   Kb(s) = (βb·s + ωb)/(s·√(βb² + 1))\n   Kb(s) = (3.162·s + 5)/(s·√(3.162² + 1)) = (3.162·s + 5)/(s·√11) = (3.162·s + 5)/(s·3.317)\n\n3. Compute the PI controller K1(s) = Kg·Kb(s):\n   K1(s) = 1.795·(3.162·s + 5)/(s·3.317) = (5.676·s + 8.975)/(s·3.317) = (1.711·s + 2.706)/s\n\n   Therefore, K1_num = [1.711, 2.706] and K1_den = [1, 0]\n\n### Task 2: Add a roll-off filter for noise rejection\n\nI need to add a first-order roll-off filter Kr(s) = (ωr·√(βr² + 1))/(s + βr·ωr) to reduce sensitivity to measurement noise.\n\nThe final controller will be: K2(s) = K1(s)·Kr(s)\n\nTo determine appropriate values for ωr and βr, I need to ensure:\n- ωr should be sufficiently higher than the loop bandwidth (5 rad/s) to avoid compromising performance\n- βr affects the shape of the roll-off and should be tuned to meet the noise sensitivity requirement\n\nFor effective noise attenuation while maintaining control performance, I'll choose:\n- ωr = 50 rad/s (10× the loop bandwidth)\n- βr = 2\n\nWith these values, the roll-off filter will significantly attenuate high-frequency noise components while having minimal effect on the closed-loop performance at the operating frequency range. The high value of ωr ensures strong attenuation at noise frequencies, and βr = 2 provides a good balance between attenuation rate and phase loss, which should keep the standard deviation of the control signal under the required 0.02 threshold when subject to the specified noise.", config=ConfigFile(K1_num=[1.711, 2.706], K1_den=[1.0, 0.0], omega_r=50.0, beta_r=2.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'K1_num': 'incorrect', 'K1_den': 'incorrect', 'noise_rejection': 'not fullfilled'}, 'score': 0.0}
