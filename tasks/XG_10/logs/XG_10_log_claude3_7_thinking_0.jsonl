First, I calculated Kg = 1/|G(j5)| = √29/3 ≈ 1.796. Then I designed the integral-boost element Kb(s) with ωb = 5 and βb = √10, giving Kb(s) = (√10·s + 5)/(s·√11). The PI controller K1(s) = Kg·Kb(s) has numerator coefficients [17.03, 26.93] and denominator coefficients [9.95, 0]. For the roll-off filter, I determined that ωr = 4 rad/s and βr = 0.5 would provide sufficient noise attenuation. With these parameters, the noise attenuation at high frequencies is approximately 2.63 times, which exceeds our requirement of 2.5 and ensures the standard deviation of the control signal due to noise stays below 0.02.', config=ConfigFile(K1_num=[17.03, 26.93], K1_den=[9.95, 0.0], omega_r=4.0, beta_r=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'K1_num': 'incorrect', 'K1_den': 'incorrect', 'noise_rejection': 'not fullfilled'}, 'score': 0.0}
