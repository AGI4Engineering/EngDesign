The ratio 0.02/0.05 = 0.4 gives the maximum allowable sensitivity to noise.\n\nSetting ω_r = 9 rad/s (above the bandwidth but not too high) and β_r = 0.5 (moderate roll-off steepness) will:\n1. Preserve control performance around the bandwidth of 5 rad/s\n2. Provide sufficient attenuation at higher frequencies where noise dominates\n3. Keep the pole at s = -4.5, which balances filtering with phase margin\n\nThese parameters should ensure the standard deviation of the control signal stays below 0.02 while maintaining good control performance.", config=ConfigFile(K1_num=[1.712, 2.706], K1_den=[1.0, 0.0], omega_r=9.0, beta_r=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'K1_num': 'incorrect', 'K1_den': 'incorrect', 'noise_rejection': 'not fullfilled'}, 'score': 0.0}
