The process is divided into two main tasks.\n\nTask 1: Design PI Controller K1(s)\n1. The plant transfer function is given as G(s) = 3 / (s + 2).\n2. The desired loop bandwidth is ω_L = 5 rad/s.\n3. First, evaluate G(jω_L) to find its magnitude:\n   G(j5) = 3 / (j5 + 2) = 3 / (2 + 5j)\n   |G(j5)| = |3| / |2 + 5j| = 3 / sqrt(2^2 + 5^2) = 3 / sqrt(4 + 25) = 3 / sqrt(29).\n4. Compute the gain K_g such that the open-loop gain at ω_L is 1:\n   K_g = 1 / |G(jω_L)| = 1 / (3 / sqrt(29)) = sqrt(29) / 3.\n5. Design the integral-boost element K_b(s) = (β_b*s + ω_b) / (s * sqrt(β_b^2 + 1)) with ω_b = ω_L = 5 rad/s and β_b = sqrt(10):\n   The term sqrt(β_b^2 + 1) = sqrt((sqrt(10))^2 + 1) = sqrt(10 + 1) = sqrt(11).\n   So, K_b(s) = (sqrt(10)*s + 5) / (s * sqrt(11)).\n6. The PI controller K1(s) is K_g * K_b(s):\n   K1(s) = (sqrt(29) / 3) * (sqrt(10)*s + 5) / (s * sqrt(11))\n   K1(s) = (sqrt(29) * (sqrt(10)*s + 5)) / (3 * sqrt(11) * s)\n   K1(s) = (sqrt(290)*s + 5*sqrt(29)) / (3*sqrt(11)*s).\n7. The numerator and denominator coefficients for K1(s) are derived assuming the form [c_n, c_{n-1}, ..., c_0] for a polynomial c_n*s^n + ... + c_0.\n   Numerator N(s) = sqrt(290)*s + 5*sqrt(29). Coefficients K1_num = [sqrt(290), 5*sqrt(29)].\n     sqrt(290) ≈ 17.02938642\n     5*sqrt(29) ≈ 5 * 5.385164807 = 26.92582404\n   Denominator D(s) = 3*sqrt(11)*s + 0. Coefficients K1_den = [3*sqrt(11), 0].\n     3*sqrt(11) ≈ 3 * 3.31662479 = 9.94987437\n   So, K1_num = [17.029386, 26.925824] and K1_den = [9.949874, 0.0] (using 6 decimal places).\n\nTask 2: Determine parameters ω_r and β_r for the roll-off filter K_r(s)\n1. The roll-off filter is K_r(s) = (ω_r * sqrt(β_r^2 + 1)) / (s + β_r * ω_r).\n2. The goal is to choose ω_r and β_r such that the controller's sensitivity to measurement noise is reduced, specifically requiring the standard deviation of the control signal σ_u <= 0.02 during the noisy interval. Direct verification of this condition requires simulation, which is not performed here. The parameters are chosen based on common control design heuristics to be 'appropriate'.\n3. Choice of ω_r: This parameter is related to the frequency where the roll-off begins. For the given filter form, |K_r(jω_r)| = 1. It should be placed significantly higher than the loop bandwidth ω_L = 5 rad/s to avoid impacting the already shaped loop. A common rule of thumb is ω_r = (5 to 10) * ω_L. We choose ω_r = 10 * ω_L = 10 * 5 = 50 rad/s.\n4. Choice of β_r: This parameter affects the DC gain of the filter, K_r(0) = sqrt(β_r^2 + 1) / β_r = sqrt(1 + 1/β_r^2), and the location of the filter's pole (s = -β_r * ω_r). To maintain the low-frequency characteristics of the controller, K_r(0) should be close to 1, which implies β_r should be large. We choose β_r = 10.\n   With β_r = 10, K_r(0) = sqrt(1 + 1/10^2) = sqrt(1.01) ≈ 1.005. This value is close to 1.\n   The filter pole is located at s = -β_r * ω_r = -10 * 50 = -500 rad/s. This pole is far from ω_L (100 times ω_L), ensuring good high-frequency noise attenuation.\n5. Impact of K_r(s) at ω_L = 5 rad/s with ω_r = 50 rad/s and β_r = 10:\n   |K_r(j5)| = (50 * sqrt(10^2 + 1)) / sqrt(5^2 + (10 * 50)^2) = (50 * sqrt(101)) / sqrt(25 + 500^2) = (50 * sqrt(101)) / sqrt(250025) ≈ 502.4938 / 500.025 ≈ 1.0049.\n   Phase ∠K_r(j5) = -arctan(5 / (10 * 50)) = -arctan(5/500) = -arctan(0.01) ≈ -0.57 degrees.\n   The gain and phase changes at ω_L are minimal, so the roll-off filter does not significantly alter the previously designed loop characteristics.\n6. Thus, the chosen 'appropriate values' are ω_r = 50.0 rad/s and β_r = 10.0. These values are based on heuristic design principles for roll-off filters. The specific condition σ_u ≤ 0.02 would need to be confirmed by simulation.", config=ConfigFile(K1_num=[17.029386, 26.925824], K1_den=[9.949874, 0.0], omega_r=50.0, beta_r=10.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'K1_num': 'incorrect', 'K1_den': 'incorrect', 'noise_rejection': 'not fullfilled'}, 'score': 0.0}
