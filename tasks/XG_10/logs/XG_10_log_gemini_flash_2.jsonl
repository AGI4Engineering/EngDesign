First, I need to calculate the controller K1(s) using the loop-shaping method, which involves finding Kg and then designing the integral-boost element Kb(s).  After that, I'll determine the values of omega_r and beta_r for the roll-off filter Kr(s) to meet the noise rejection requirement (sigma_u <= 0.02). I'll perform the calculations as accurately as possible to provide the requested JSON structure.\n\n**Task 1: Designing K1(s)**\n\n1.  **Calculate Kg:**\n    *   G(s) = 3 / (s + 2)\n    *   omega_L = 5 rad/s\n    *   G(j*omega_L) = 3 / (j*5 + 2)\n    *   |G(j*omega_L)| = 3 / sqrt(5^2 + 2^2) = 3 / sqrt(29) ≈ 3 / 5.385 ≈ 0.557\n    *   Kg = 1 / |G(j*omega_L)| ≈ 1 / 0.557 ≈ 1.795\n\n2.  **Design Kb(s):**\n    *   omega_b = omega_L = 5\n    *   beta_b = sqrt(10) ≈ 3.162\n    *   Kb(s) = (beta_b * s + omega_b) / (s * sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) = (3.162*s + 5) / (s * sqrt(10 + 1)) = (3.162*s + 5) / (s * sqrt(11)) ≈ (3.162*s + 5) / (3.317*s)\n\n3.  **Calculate K1(s):**\n    *   K1(s) = Kg * Kb(s) ≈ 1.795 * (3.162*s + 5) / (3.317*s) ≈ (5.676*s + 8.975) / (3.317*s)  \n    *   Converting to the form of numerator and denominator coefficients: K1_num = [5.676, 8.975], K1_den = [3.317, 0].\n\n\n**Task 2: Roll-off Filter and Noise Rejection**\n\nSince I cannot run simulations, I need to select reasonable values for omega_r and beta_r based on the general guidelines for roll-off filter design. A common approach is to set omega_r to be a few times the loop bandwidth (omega_L) to avoid affecting the performance near the bandwidth. Beta_r typically ranges from 0.1 to 1. A smaller beta_r provides more attenuation but might affect the phase margin more.\n\nLet's start with the following choices:\n*   omega_r = 3 * omega_L = 3 * 5 = 15\n*   beta_r = 0.5\n\nI am choosing these values as a starting point, but without the ability to simulate and verify sigma_u <= 0.02, this choice is an educated guess.\n\n**Final Result**\nBased on these calculations and assumptions, here's the JSON response:", config=ConfigFile(K1_num=[5.676, 8.975], K1_den=[3.317, 0.0], omega_r=15.0, beta_r=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'K1_num': 'correct', 'K1_den': 'correct', 'noise_rejection': 'not fullfilled'}, 'score': 40.0}
