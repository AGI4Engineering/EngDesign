{'completion_tokens': 2902, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A reasonable outcome of this Michell‐type setup is that the final layout develops about the vertical centerline x=1, but not about the horizontal axis y=0.5 (the load’s direction is downward, hence it breaks y‐symmetry). In this case the optimized layout is symmetric in x only. With a target volume fraction of 0.15, a typical minimal compliance for a problem of this size and stiffness can be on the order of a few to tens of units.
