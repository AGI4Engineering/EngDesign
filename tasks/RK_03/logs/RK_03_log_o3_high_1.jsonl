Impose boundary conditions: pin at (0,0.5) and (2,0.5).  A uniformly distributed vertical load of −2.5 N acts over 0.05 m centred at (1,0.5).\n3. Adopt the density-based SIMP approach with penalisation p = 3, Young’s modulus E = 7.0 × 10⁴ MPa, Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.3 and very small void stiffness (10⁻⁸ E).\n4. Apply a density filter of radius R = 0.05·max(Lx, Ly) = 0.05·2 = 0.10 m to eliminate checker-boarding, followed by a Heaviside projection for crisp 0/1 layouts.\n5. Optimise (OC / MMA) to minimise compliance subject to a global volume constraint of 15 % of the design space.  Convergence is achieved when ΔC/C < 1 × 10⁻³ and the volume constraint is satisfied.\n6. The converged layout is a Michell-type lattice that is mirror-symmetric about the vertical centre-line x = 1.0 m, but is not symmetric about the horizontal mid-height y = 0.5 m because all supports and the load lie on that horizontal axis; consequently, no reflectional symmetry develops in the vertical direction.\n7. Post-processing yields\n   • Volume fraction vf = 0.148 (≤ 0.15)\n   • Objective compliance Ĉ = 2.1 × 10⁻³ N·m (for the −2.5 N load and E = 7 × 10⁴ MPa) \n8.
