{'completion_tokens': 6952, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I analyzed the Michell structure problem with a 2D rectangular domain (2x1), a downward load of 2.5 at (1,0.5), and pin supports at (0,0.5) and (2,0.5). Given the SIMP optimization approach with volume fraction limited to 0.15, I determined the design would be symmetric about the x-axis but not the y-axis. This is because while the geometry and boundary conditions are symmetric about x=1, the vertical load direction creates an asymmetry in the y-direction stress fields. The optimization will use the full allowed volume fraction (0.15) for maximum stiffness, resulting in a compliance value of approximately 167.0.', config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=167.0, VF=0.15, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.15, 'vf_threshold': 0.15, 'compliance_error': 'Fail (CE=16244.2647)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Partially Pass'}, 'score': 40}
