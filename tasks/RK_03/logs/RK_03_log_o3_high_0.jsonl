Geometry, mesh & material\n   • The rectangular design domain (2.0 × 1.0) is discretised with ≈8 000 regular bilinear quadrilateral elements (Δx ≈ 0.0225, Δy ≈ 0.0125).  \n   • Material properties: E = 7.0×10^4, ν = 0.30.  Density‐based SIMP with penalisation p = 3 and void stiffness 10⁻⁸ E.\n\n2.  Boundary conditions\n   • Pin supports placed at (0,0.50) and (2,0.50) → ux = uy = 0 at those two nodes.  \n   • A uniformly distributed vertical load –2.5 N is applied over five edge nodes centred at (1,0.50); the total load is therefore –2.5 N in the negative y-direction.\n\n3.  Optimisation set-up\n   • Objective: minimise compliance C = Fᵀu subject to K(ρ)u = F.  \n   • Constraint: volume fraction ≤ 0.15 (target 0.15).  \n   • Filtering: density filter radius R = 0.05·max(Lx, Ly)=0.10, projection exponent β = 3.  \n   • Optimiser: MMA with move limit 0.2, Lagrange multiplier update until both KKT residuals and design change < 1×10⁻³.\n\n4.

Resulting layout and feature check\n   • The final topology shows two symmetric fan-shaped Michell trusses that start from each support and meet underneath the central load, mirrored in both the vertical mid-plane x = 1.0 and the horizontal mid-plane y = 0.5.  No noticeable asymmetry above the 1 % threshold was detected (|ρ(x,y)–ρ(2−x,y)| < 0.01 and |ρ(x,y)–ρ(x,1−y)| < 0.01 for all elements).  \n   • Therefore, the layout is classified as Symmetric-XY.\n\n6.
