If the design is symmetric about the x-axis, label it as 'Symmetric-X'; otherwise, label it as 'Asymmetric-X'.\n\n4. **Output the Results:**\n   - Output the minimum structural compliance (C_y_hat), volume fraction (VF), and design feature (Dsg_feature) as required.\n\nBy following these steps, we can obtain the desired topology optimized design and the required outputs.", config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=150.0, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'compliance_error': 'Fail (CE=2602.8094)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Fail'}, 'score': 30}
