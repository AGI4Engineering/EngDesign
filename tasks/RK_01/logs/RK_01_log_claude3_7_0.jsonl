Using the SIMP method with volume fraction constraint of 0.25, I determined the optimized structure would form diagonal members connecting the load point to the supports. Since the load is applied at x=2 (not the center x=3), the resulting design would be asymmetric in the x-direction. Based on benchmark problems and the specified parameters, I estimated the compliance (C_y_hat) to be approximately 87.5 and the volume fraction (VF) to be 0.25 (at the constraint limit).', config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=87.5, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Asymmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'compliance_error': 'Fail (CE=1517.8888)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Pass'}, 'score': 50}
