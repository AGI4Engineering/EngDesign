If the design is symmetric, output 'Symmetric-X'; otherwise, output 'Asymmetric-X'.\n\n4. **Store the Results:**\n   - Store the minimum structural compliance, volume fraction, and design feature (symmetry) in the specified variables.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the expected results are as follows:", config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=150.0, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'compliance_error': 'Fail (CE=2602.8094)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Fail'}, 'score': 30}
