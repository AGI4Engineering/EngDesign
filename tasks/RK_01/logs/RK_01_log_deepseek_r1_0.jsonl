{'completion_tokens': 1117, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The design domain is a 2D rectangular region with dimensions 6x1. A vertical load of 5.0 is applied at (2,1), creating an asymmetric load condition. The supports (pin at (0,0) and roller at (6,0)) further break x-direction symmetry. Using SIMP topology optimization with a volume fraction limit of 0.25, the optimized design minimizes compliance. Since the load is applied asymmetrically (x=2 vs. symmetric x=3), the material distribution will favor the left side, resulting in an 'Asymmetric-X' design. The volume fraction is constrained to 0.25, and the compliance is calculated based on material stiffness and load distribution.", config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=142.8, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Asymmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'compliance_error': 'Fail (CE=2477.8265)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Pass'}, 'score': 50}
