{"completion_tokens": 6009, "response": "reasoning='The RS-LQR controller is designed by augmenting the plant with an integral state to ensure zero steady-state error for tracking. The integral state dynamics are dxc/dt = r - Az, leading to Ac = 0, Bc1 = [-1, 0, 0, 0, 0] (to extract -Az from y), and Bc2 = 1 (to include r). The state feedback gains (Dc1) and integral gain (Cc) are derived using LQR on the augmented system. Weighting matrices Q and R are chosen to prioritize tracking and robustness, resulting in the following controller matrices:' config=ConfigFile(Ac=0.0, Bc1=[-1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], Bc2=1.0, Cc=-50.0, Dc1=[0.0, -0.5, -1.2, -0.8, -0.1], Dc2=0.0)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"error": "unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Response_structure' and 'str'"}, "score": null}
