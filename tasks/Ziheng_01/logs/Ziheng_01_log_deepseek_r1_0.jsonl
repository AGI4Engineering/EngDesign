{"completion_tokens": 7229, "response": "reasoning=\"The task requires designing a Robust-Servo LQR controller for an aircraft pitch-axis plant. The approach involves augmenting the plant with an integral state to track the reference signal (A_z) and ensure zero steady-state error. The integral state's dynamics are driven by the tracking error (r - y[0]). The controller uses LQR design on the augmented system to compute feedback gains for the plant states (from y[1:] and the integral state. The LQR weights are tuned to meet rise time and stability margin requirements. The resulting controller matrices Ac, Bc1, Bc2, Cc, Dc1, and Dc2 are derived from the integral action and LQR gain matrix.\" config=ConfigFile(Ac=0.0, Bc1=[-1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], Bc2=1.0, Cc=-50.0, Dc1=[0.0, -10.0, -5.0, -20.0, -1.0], Dc2=0.0)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"error": "unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Response_structure' and 'str'"}, "score": null}
