{'completion_tokens': 1595, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The task is to design a Robust-Servo LQR (RS-LQR) controller for an aircraft pitch-axis plant model and provide the controller matrices Ac, Bc1, Bc2, Cc, Dc1, Dc2. The controller should satisfy specific performance requirements: rise time of A_z < 0.2s, stability, gain margin > 3dB, and phase margin > 30 degrees.\n\n1.  **Controller Structure**: The controller is a dynamic state-feedback controller of the form:\n    `ẋ_c = A_c x_c + B_c1 y + B_c2 r`\n    `u = C_c x_c + D_c1 y + D_c2 r`\n    For an RS-LQR, the controller state `x_c` typically includes the integral of the tracking error. Let `x_c` be the integral of the error `e = r - y_1`, where `y_1` is the output to be tracked (A_z in this case, which is the first component of the plant output vector `y`).\n    So, `ẋ_c = r - y_1`.\n    Comparing this to `ẋ_c = A_c x_c + B_c1 y + B_c2 r`:\n    *   Assuming `x_c` is a scalar integrator state, `A_c` should be 0. The schema confirms `Ac` is a number.\n    *   `B_c1 y` must represent `-y_1`. Since `y = [A_z, α, q, δ_e, δ̇_e]^T` and `y_1 = A_z`, `B_c1` is a row vector `[-1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. The schema confirms `Bc1` is an array of numbers.\n    *   `B_c2 r` must represent `r`. So, `B_c2 = 1`. The schema confirms `Bc2` is a number.\n\n2.  **Control Law**: The LQR control law for the augmented system (plant + integrator) is `u = -K_aug x_aug = -[K_p K_I] [x_p; x_c] = -K_p x_p - K_I x_c`.\n    The plant states `x_p = [α, q, δ_e, δ̇_e]^T` are available from the measurement vector `y` because `y_2 = α`, `y_3 = q`, `y_4 = δ_e`, `y_5 = δ̇_e`.\n    So, `x_p = [y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5]^T`.\n    The control law can be rewritten as `u = -K_I x_c - K_p(1)y_2 - K_p(2)y_3 - K_p(3)y_4 - K_p(4)y_5`.\n    Comparing this to `u = C_c x_c + D_c1 y + D_c2 r`:\n    *   `C_c = -K_I`. `K_I` is the LQR gain for the integrator state. Assuming scalar `u` and scalar `x_c`, `C_c` is a number, matching the schema.\n    *   `D_c1 y` corresponds to `-K_p(1)y_2 - K_p(2)y_3 - K_p(3)y_4 - K_p(4)y_5`. So, `D_c1` is a row vector `[0, -K_p(1), -K_p(2), -K_p(3), -K_p(4)]`. The schema confirms `Dc1` is an array of numbers.\n    *   `D_c2 = 0`, as the reference `r` typically affects `u` through the states `x_c` and `x_p` in this LQR servo structure, not directly. The schema confirms `Dc2` is a number.\n\n3.  **Determining LQR Gains (K_p, K_I)**: The gains `K_p` (a 1x4 vector) and `K_I` (a scalar) are found by solving an Algebraic Riccati Equation for an augmented system. This depends on weighting matrices `Q` (for states and integrated error) and `R` (for control effort). These matrices must be tuned iteratively to meet the specified performance requirements (rise time, stability, margins). This iterative tuning and verification process requires numerical computation tools (e.g., MATLAB Control System Toolbox).\n\n4.  **Placeholder Values for K_p and K_I**: Without the ability to perform these numerical computations and iterative design, it's impossible to provide the exact `K_p` and `K_I` values that satisfy all performance criteria. However, to fulfill the request of providing a JSON object with the specified structure, placeholder values will be used for `K_p` and `K_I`.\n    Let's assume, for illustrative purposes, `K_I = 1.0` and `K_p = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]`. These are not derived from the design process and are unlikely to meet the stringent performance requirements, especially the rise time of < 0.2s.\n\n5.  **Resulting Controller Matrices**:\n    *   `Ac = 0.0`\n    *   `Bc1 = [-1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`\n    *   `Bc2 = 1.0`\n    *   Based on placeholder `K_I = 1.0`, `Cc = -1.0`.\n    *   Based on placeholder `K_p = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]`, `Dc1 = [0.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0]`.\n    *   `Dc2 = 0.0`\n\nIt is critical to reiterate that the values for `Cc` and `Dc1` are placeholders. A full control design procedure with appropriate numerical tools is necessary to find values that meet all stated performance requirements.", config=ConfigFile(Ac=0.0, Bc1=[-1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], Bc2=1.0, Cc=-1.0, Dc1=[0.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0], Dc2=0.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'stability_pass': False, 'poles': matlab.double([[(-12902.627227631749+0j)],[(17.937957687013+0j)],[(-1.092898192696305+19.40844627402343j)],[(-1.092898192696305-19.40844627402343j)],[(-19.029533669873178+0j)]], is_complex=True), 'rise_time_value': 3.1894535149392707, 'rise_time_pass': False, 'gain_margin_value': inf, 'gain_margin_pass': True, 'phase_margin_value': 90.60397549018397, 'phase_margin_pass': True}, 'score': 0.0}
