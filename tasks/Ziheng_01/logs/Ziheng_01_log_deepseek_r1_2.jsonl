{"completion_tokens": 6926, "response": "reasoning=\"The RS-LQR controller is designed by augmenting the plant with an integrator state to track the reference signal. The integral of the error between the reference and the output A_z forms the controller's state. LQR is applied to the augmented system to compute feedback gains, ensuring stability and performance. The matrices are structured such that Ac=0 (integrator dynamics), Bc1 captures -A_z from the output, Bc2 introduces the reference, Cc and Dc1 implement the state feedback from plant states (available in y), and Dc2=0 as feedforward is handled by the integrator. The gains are tuned to meet rise time and margin requirements.\" config=ConfigFile(Ac=0.0, Bc1=[-1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], Bc2=1.0, Cc=-1276.9, Dc1=[0.0, -12.5, -3.8, 45.2, -0.7], Dc2=0.0)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"error": "unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Response_structure' and 'str'"}, "score": null}
