First, let's understand the components of J:\n   - J = E[√(R_T)] · E[Δ̂_T] where R_T is the cumulative regret and Δ̂_T is the maximum ATE estimation error\n   - The algorithm has an exploration phase (rounds 1 to K^α L^β) and an exploitation phase (remaining rounds)\n\n2. Analyzing the regret:\n   - Exploration phase regret: O(K^α L^β) since we pull arms uniformly\n   - Exploitation phase regret: O(√(T - K^α L^β)) from UCB algorithm\n   - Total regret: R_T = O(K^α L^β + √(T - K^α L^β))\n\n3. Analyzing the ATE estimation error:\n   - Each arm gets pulled K^(α-1) L^β times during exploration\n   - The estimation error is approximately O(1/√(K^(α-1) L^β))\n\n4. Let's parameterize K^α L^β = T^γ where T = L·K and 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1\n   - When K and L are of similar magnitude: α + β ≈ 2γ\n\n5. Examining different cases:\n   - When γ < 1/2: The exploitation regret dominates but poor estimation\n   - When γ > 1/2: The exploration regret dominates with better estimation\n   - When γ = 1/2: Both regret components are balanced\n\n6. Analysis shows that J is approximately:\n   - For γ < 1/2: J increases as γ decreases (worse performance)\n   - For γ ≥ 1/2: J ≈ O(T^(1/4)) or equivalently O(√K), independent of the specific value of γ\n\n7. Therefore, any value in the range 1/2 ≤ γ ≤ 1 is optimal\n   - This translates to 1 ≤ α+β ≤ 2 for K and L of similar magnitude\n   - With α = β (equal importance), this gives us 1/2 ≤ α,β ≤ 1\n\nTherefore, the lower bounds are α̲ = β̲ = 1/2, and the upper bounds are ᾱ = β̄ = 1.", config=ConfigFile(bar_alpha=0.5, under_linealpha=1.0, bar_beta=0.5, under_linebeta=1.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'bar_alpha': 0.5, 'bar_beta': 0.5, 'underline_alpha': 1.0, 'underline_beta': 1.0}, 'score': 25.0}
