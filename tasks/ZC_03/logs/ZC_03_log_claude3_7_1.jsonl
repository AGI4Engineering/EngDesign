The expected regret in this phase is proportional to K^α·L^β.\n\nDuring the exploitation phase (UCB), the regret scales with √(T - K^α·L^β). \n\nTherefore, the total regret is approximately:\nR_T ≈ c₁·K^α·L^β + c₂·√(T - K^α·L^β)\n\nWhere c₁ and c₂ are constants. For large T, we have E[√R_T] ≈ √(c₁·K^α·L^β + c₂·√(T - K^α·L^β))\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the ATE estimation error Δ̂_T\nThe ATE estimation error depends on how well we estimate each arm's mean. After the exploration phase, each arm is pulled approximately K^α-1·L^β times.\n\nThe estimation error scales with 1/√n where n is the number of pulls, so:\nE[Δ̂_T] ≈ c₃/√(K^α-1·L^β) = c₃·K^(1-α)/2·L^(-β/2)\n\n### Step 4: Computing the objective J\nJ = E[√R_T] · E[Δ̂_T]\n≈ √(c₁·K^α·L^β + c₂·√(T - K^α·L^β)) · c₃·K^(1-α)/2·L^(-β/2)\n\nAsymptotically, as T gets large, we need to balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off.\n\n### Step 5: Minimizing J\nSince T = L·K, the constraint 1 ≤ K^α·L^β ≤ T becomes 1 ≤ K^α·L^β ≤ L·K.\n\nFor J to be minimized, we need α = 1/2 and β = 1/2. These values balance the regret and estimation error optimally.\n\nHowever, we need to check if these values satisfy our constraint:\nK^(1/2)·L^(1/2) ≤ L·K\nThis is satisfied when K ≥ 1 and L ≥ 1, which is given in our problem.\n\n### Step 6: Determining the bounds\nSince α = 1/2 and β = 1/2 are the optimal values, and we want a range [ᾱ, α] × [β̄, β̲] such that any choice within this range minimizes J, we must have:\nᾱ = α = 1/2\nβ̄ = β̲ = 1/2\n\nTherefore, our bounds are:\nᾱ = 1/2 (upper bound of α)\nα = 1/2 (lower bound of α)\nβ̄ = 1/2 (upper bound of β)\nβ̲ = 1/2 (lower bound of β)", config=ConfigFile(bar_alpha=0.5, under_linealpha=0.5, bar_beta=0.5, under_linebeta=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'bar_alpha': 0.5, 'bar_beta': 0.5, 'underline_alpha': 0.5, 'underline_beta': 0.5}, 'score': 25.0}
