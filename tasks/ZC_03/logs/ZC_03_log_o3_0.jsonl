Regret:\n   •  Exploration regret ≈ m (round–robin pulls).\n   •  Exploitation (UCB) regret is ≈ O(K·log T).  With the instruction ‘ignore the logarithmic term and other constant factors’, that part is treated as a constant O(K).  Hence, up to multiplicative constants, R_T ≍ m + K.\n\n2.  ATE-estimation error:\n   Every arm is sampled about m/K times during exploration, only O(log T) additional pulls in exploitation.  Hence, up to the same level of approximation,\n        Ĥ_Δ_T  := E[ max|Δ̂_ij −Δ_ij| ] ≍ √(K/m).\n\n3.  Objective J:\n        J(α,β) ≍ √(R_T) · Ĥ_Δ_T ≍ √(m + K) · √(K/m) = √K · √(1 + K/m).\n   The function √(1 + K/m) is strictly decreasing in m.  Therefore J is minimized by taking the largest possible exploration length, i.e.\n        m* = T  =  K · L.\n\n4.  Condition for m*:\n        K^α L^β = T  ⇒  α logK + β logL = logK + logL.\n   Any pair (α,β) that satisfies this equality makes the exploration phase span the whole horizon and thus achieves the minimum of J.\n   The simplest and most symmetric choice is\n        α = 1 ,   β = 1.\n   Choosing other values that still satisfy the equality only trades off K-powers against L-powers while keeping m fixed at T, leaving J unchanged at its minimum value.\n\n5.  Bounds:\n   Because the optimum is reached exactly when α = 1 and β = 1 (round-robin for the full horizon), the interval of optimal exponents degenerates to the single point {1}.
