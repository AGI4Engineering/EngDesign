{"completion_tokens": 712, "response": "reasoning='The objective function (J) is defined as the product of the square root of the regret (R_T) and the maximum ATE estimation error (\\\\hat{\\\\Delta}_T).  We want to minimize J. The regret in the UCB algorithm scales roughly as R_T ~ T^(1/2), while the ATE estimation error scales as \\\\hat{\\\\Delta}_T ~ \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{K}{N}} where N is the number of samples per arm after the exploration phase. Given that the exploration phase has a length of K^\\\\alpha L^\\\\beta, each arm is pulled roughly K^(alpha-1)L^\\\\beta times during this phase. Then, the exploitation phase continues for T - K^\\\\alpha L^\\\\beta iterations. So, the total number of samples per arm at the end of T is N = K^(alpha-1) L^\\\\beta + \\\\frac{T - K^\\\\alpha L^\\\\beta}{K} = K^(alpha-1)L^\\\\beta + L - K^(alpha-1)L^\\\\beta = L. Thus \\\\hat{\\\\Delta}_T ~ \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{K}{L}} is independent of (\\\\alpha, \\\\beta) and the length of the exploration phase does not matter. The problem statement says that R_T ~ \\\\sqrt{T} for the exploitation phase. Therefore, we only need to ensure the condition 1 <= K^\\\\alpha L^\\\\beta <= T is satisfied, which is 1 <= K^\\\\alpha L^\\\\beta <= LK. Then the best strategy would be choosing (\\\\alpha) and (\\\\beta) that satisties the condition. Since there is no dependence of J on (\\\\alpha) and (\\\\beta), any values that satisfies the condition will be optimal. \\n\\nTo ensure  1 <= K^alpha L^beta <= T=LK , we need to determine the range of (\\\\alpha) and (\\\\beta).\\n\\nLower bounds:\\nK^alpha L^beta >= 1. Taking logs, (alpha log(K) + beta log(L) >= 0). If both (log(K)) and (log(L)) are positive (i.e., K > 1 and L > 1), then (\\\\alpha) and (\\\\beta) can be zero or positive. If (\\\\alpha = \\\\beta = 0), K^alpha L^beta = 1, so (\\\\underline{\\\\alpha} = 0, \\\\underline{\\\\beta} = 0) is a valid lower bound.\\n\\nUpper bounds:\\nK^alpha L^beta <= LK.
