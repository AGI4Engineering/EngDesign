{'completion_tokens': 11992, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A convenient way to see why the two‐phase scheme forces both α and β to be set so that K^α L^β is on the same order as K⋅L is to look at how each phase contributes to the regret and the estimation error.  If x := K^α L^β is the length of the uniform “exploration” phase, then:\n\n•  In that phase we must pull each arm round‐robin, so x≈K^α L^β pulls in total incur roughly x in regret (since each suboptimal arm is pulled about as often as the best arm).  \n\n•  The second “exploitation” phase (T – x pulls) is run with a standard bandit algorithm (e.g. UCB).  If x is significantly smaller than the full budget T = K L, that UCB phase still spends some pulls identifying the best arm, typically incurring on the order of √(K (T – x)) in regret.\n\n•  Meanwhile, to estimate all pairwise ATEs reliably, each of the K arms must have been sampled quite often, or else the maximum ATE estimation error would be large.  If each arm is sampled n times, then typical confidence bounds on the arm‐means are on the order O(1/√n).  In the two‐phase plan, the main guaranteed sample of each arm is from the uniform round‐robin portion: that yields about x/K pulls for each arm, so each arm’s estimation error scales like 1/√(x/K) = √(K/x).  Hence overall the maximum pairwise ATE error is also O(√(K/x)).\n\nPutting these together, in leading order the regret is about R_T ≈ x + √(K (K L – x)), while the maximum ATE error is on the order of √(K/x).  Because the objective J = E[√(R_T)]⋅E[Δ̂_T] is (up to constants) roughly √(R_T) × √(K/x), we see from a simple “balancing” argument that if x is only a vanishing fraction of T, then the ATE error term is large; while if x is only a fractional portion c·T of the entire horizon T, the product saturates at a level ∼√(K).  Indeed the best we can do asymptotically, ignoring log factors, is to dedicate an order‐one fraction of the horizon purely to exploring all arms; that forces the overall product to scale like √(K).  In particular, one can check that choosing x as the entire time horizon (i.e. pure uniform exploration) also yields the same leading order √(K).  That shows that to minimize J, the uniform “exploration” length must scale proportionally to K L, so that K^α L^β ~ K L in the large‐sample limit, forcing α = 1 and β = 1.\n\nHence the upper and lower “optimal” exponents both collapse to 1.
