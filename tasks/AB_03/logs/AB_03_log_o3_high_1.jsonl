The code has to: • read the file images/test_shape.png • threshold it so the white shape is foreground • locate ALL external contours with cv2.findContours • pick the contour with the greatest cv2.contourArea • simplify that contour with cv2.approxPolyDP (using epsilon = 1 % of the perimeter) • produce its convex hull with cv2.convexHull • return both arrays, or (None, None) when the image cannot be loaded or no contours exist.  The function must be called get_simplified_contours, accept no arguments, perform no I/O besides reading the image, and avoid any display / saving calls.  The nested “config” field therefore contains a detailed reasoning followed by a stringified, newline-escaped version of the complete Python solution that satisfies every stated requirement.', config=CodeSolutionOutput(reasoning="The algorithm follows the exact implementation steps given in the prompt:\n\n1. Load image – Hard-coded path 'images/test_shape.png' is opened with cv2.imread.  If the returned value is None we immediately return (None, None).\n2. Pre-process – Convert to grayscale with cv2.cvtColor; then binarise with cv2.threshold using THRESH_BINARY so the white object remains white and background black.\n3. Find contours – Use cv2.findContours with RETR_EXTERNAL (only outer borders) and CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE (vertex compression).  Because OpenCV 3/4 return a different tuple length, we pick the contour list with a conditional expression.\n4. Identify largest contour – If the list is empty we return (None, None); otherwise choose max(contours, key=cv2.contourArea).\n5. Approximate polygon – Calculate arcLength, multiply by 0.01 to obtain epsilon, and pass everything to cv2.approxPolyDP.\n6. Convex hull – Apply cv2.convexHull to the same largest contour.\n7. Return – Provide (approx_vertices, hull_vertices).  All NumPy arrays are returned unchanged so that callers can immediately process or draw them later.  No cv2.imshow / cv2.imwrite is used.\n\nEdge-cases handled: (i) image not found, (ii) zero contours, (iii) largest contour has zero area (pathological but safe-guarded).
