{'completion_tokens': 16343, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A simple way to arrive at one suitable trio of angles is to note that the final Stokes vector is purely vertical and has intensity 0.3, yet the initial beam has intensity 1 and is partially but predominantly horizontally polarized.  One can show that choosing the first linear polarizer at 0° (horizontal) reduces the intensity to 0.8 and yields a purely horizontal output (Stokes [0.8,0.8,0,0]).  Passing this through a quarter‐wave plate set at 30° turns its Q‐component to 0.2 while preserving total intensity at 0.8.  A final linear polarizer at 90° then transmits 0.3 and yields a Stokes vector [0.3, -0.3, 0,0] as requested.  Thus a convenient choice of angles is (θ1, θ2, θ3) = (0°, 30°, 90°).', config=ConfigFile(angle12=0.0, angle22=30.0, angle32=90.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'S0': {'predicted': 0.1999999999999999, 'ground_truth': -0.3, 'diff': 0.4999999999999999, 'within_tolerance': False}, 'S1': {'predicted': -0.1999999999999999, 'ground_truth': 0.3, 'diff': 0.4999999999999999, 'within_tolerance': False}, 'S2': {'predicted': 2.4492935982947053e-17, 'ground_truth': 0.0, 'diff': 2.4492935982947053e-17, 'within_tolerance': True}, 'S3': {'predicted': 0.0, 'ground_truth': 0.0, 'diff': 0.0, 'within_tolerance': True}}, 'score': 40}
