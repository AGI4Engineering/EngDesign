You are a student working in a electrical and computer engineering optics laboratory, focusing on polarization imaging. Your current task and goal is to design and set up an experimental test stand aimed to learn things of the polarized light behaviors. For the setup needed you will be required to use several components. First you will need to use a linear polarizer as the first component. Second, a quarter wave plate is needed. Third, another linear polarizer will be used. These filters will help you understand key features of contrast and attenuation of light. Additionally, three motors will be used to automate the rotation of the filter and wave plate. The goal is to have a reliable and flexible platform for polarization experiments.
You are working with a ideal QWP with retardance pi/2 and two ideal linear polarizers, given that the input angle is [1,0.6,0.2,0 ] provide the angels so that the stoke vector of output is [0.3 ,-0.3 , 0, 0 ]
Requirements: angle: -180-180 degrees
Notes: Are angles are given with respect to the horizontal axis
