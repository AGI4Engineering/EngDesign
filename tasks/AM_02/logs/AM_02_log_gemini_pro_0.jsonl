{'completion_tokens': 2508, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The task is to find collision-free paths for two robots on a 30x30 grid (coordinates 0-29 for x and y). Robots are 2x2, pedestrians are 2x2. Static obstacles and moving pedestrians must be avoided. Robots have a speed limit: |dx| <= 2 and |dy| <= 2 per time step (1 second). Trajectories are from t=0 to t=19.\n\n1.  **Environment Setup**:\n    *   Grid: 30x30. Robot bottom-left coordinates (rx, ry) must satisfy 0 <= rx <= 28 and 0 <= ry <= 28.\n    *   Static Obstacles (SO, defined by inclusive cell coordinates [x1,y1] to [x2,y2]):\n        *   SO1: x in [5,7], y in [0,15]\n        *   SO2: x in [10,20], y in [20,29]\n        *   SO3: x in [15,29], y in [5,10]\n    *   Pedestrians: Three pedestrians with given trajectories. Their positions at each time `t` are dynamic obstacles.\n    *   Robots:\n        *   R1: Start (17,2) at t=0, End (5,24) at t=19.\n        *   R2: Start (5,25) at t=0, End (25,25) at t=19.\n\n2.  **Pathfinding Strategy**:\n    *   A sequential pathfinding approach is used: Plan for R1 first, then for R2 treating R1's path as a dynamic obstacle.\n    *   A* search algorithm (or a similar heuristic-guided search) is mentally simulated to find paths. The 'cost' is time. The heuristic is time-to-goal (e.g., max(|dx_to_goal|, |dy_to_goal|) / 2).\n    *   Collision checking:\n        *   Static: Robot's 2x2 area [rx,rx+1]x[ry,ry+1] must not overlap with any SO.\n        *   Dynamic (Pedestrians/Other Robot): Robot at (rx,ry) and obstacle at (ox,oy) (both 2x2) collide if abs(rx-ox) < 2 AND abs(ry-oy) < 2.\n        *   Boundary: 0 <= rx <= 28, 0 <= ry <= 28.\n        *   Speed: Change in x and y between consecutive time steps must be <= 2.\n\n3.  **Robot 1 Path Generation (R1: (17,2) -> (5,24))**:\n    *   R1 starts at (17,2), to the right of SO3. Goal (5,24) is to the left of SO3, SO2, and potentially interacting with SO1.\n    *   Strategy: Move left while staying below SO3 (y < 5), then continue left to pass west of SO2 (rx <= 8), then move up, passing west and then north of SO1 (ry > 15 when x is near SO1's x-range).\n    *   Proposed path for R1 (manually checked for collisions and speed):\n        (0,17,2) -> (1,15,3) -> (2,13,4) -> (3,11,6) -> (4,9,8) -> (5,9,10) -> (6,9,12) -> (7,9,14) -> (8,9,16) -> (9,7,18) -> (10,5,20) -> (11,5,22) -> (12,5,24).\n    *   R1 reaches goal (5,24) at t=12. It waits at (5,24) from t=13 to t=19. This waiting period is also checked for collisions.\n\n4.  **Robot 2 Path Generation (R2: (5,25) -> (25,25))**:\n    *   R2 starts at (5,25), to the west of SO2. Goal (25,25) is to the east of SO2. R2's y-coordinate (25) is within SO2's y-range [20,29].\n    *   Strategy: R2 must maneuver vertically to pass SO2. It will go under SO2 (ry <= 18).\n        *   Move right from (5,25) to x=8 (e.g., (8,25)), staying west of SO2's x-range [10,20].\n        *   Move down from (8,25) to (8,18) to get below SO2's y-range.\n        *   Move right from (8,18) to (21,18), passing under SO2.\n        *   Move up from (21,18) to (21,25).\n        *   Move right from (21,25) to goal (25,25).\n    *   Proposed path for R2 (manually checked for static obstacles, pedestrians, R1's path, and speed):\n        (0,5,25) -> (1,7,25) -> (2,8,25) -> (3,8,23) -> (4,8,21) -> (5,8,19) -> (6,8,18) -> (7,10,18) -> (8,12,18) -> (9,14,18) -> (10,16,18) -> (11,18,18) -> (12,20,18) -> (13,21,18) -> (14,21,20) -> (15,21,22) -> (16,21,24) -> (17,21,25) -> (18,23,25) -> (19,25,25).\n    *   R2 reaches its goal at t=19.\n\n5.  **Final Verification**:\n    *   Start positions: Correct for t=0.\n    *   End positions: Correct for t=19.\n    *   Static obstacle collision: Paths avoid all static obstacles.\n    *   Pedestrian collision: Paths avoid all pedestrians at all time steps.\n    *   Robot-robot collision: R1 and R2 paths do not collide.\n    *   Speed limits: All moves adhere to |dx|<=2, |dy|<=2.\n    *   Boundary conditions: All robot positions (rx,ry) are within [0,28]x[0,28].", config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory1=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=15, y=3), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=13, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=11, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=9, y=8), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=9, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=9, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=9, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=9, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=7, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=5, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=5, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=5, y=24)], robot_trajectory2=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=5, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=7, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=8, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=8, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=8, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=8, y=19), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=8, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=10, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=12, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=14, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=16, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=18, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=20, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=21, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=21, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=21, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=21, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=21, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=23, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=25, y=25)])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'robot1: Start position correct': True, 'robot1: End position correct': True, 'robot1: Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'robot1: Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'robot1: Over Speed limit': False, 'robot2: Start position correct': True, 'robot2: End position correct': True, 'robot2: Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'robot2: Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'robot2: Over Speed limit': False}, 'score': 100.0}
