{'completion_tokens': 2332, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The task is to navigate two robots in a 30x30 grid from t=0 to t=19, avoiding static and dynamic (pedestrian) obstacles. Both robots and pedestrians are 2x2 units.\n\n1.  **Environment and Entity Interpretation**:\n    *   Grid: 30x30, origin (0,0) at bottom-left. Coordinates (x,y) for bottom-left corner of an entity. Max coordinate for bottom-left of a 2x2 entity is (28,28).\n    *   Robot/Pedestrian Size: 2x2. A robot at (rx,ry) occupies cells [rx,rx+1]x[ry,ry+1].\n    *   Time: Discrete steps from t=0 to t=19.\n\n2.  **Obstacle Modeling**:\n    *   **Static Obstacles**: Defined by ((x1,y1), (x2,y2)) representing bottom-left and top-right inclusive corners.\n        *   SO1: ((5,0), (7,15)) -> cells (x,y) where 5<=x<=7, 0<=y<=15.\n        *   SO2: ((10,20), (20,30)) -> cells (x,y) where 10<=x<=20, 20<=y<=29 (y clipped to grid max 29).\n        *   SO3: ((15,5), (30,10)) -> cells (x,y) where 15<=x<=29, 5<=y<=10 (x clipped to grid max 29).\n        A robot at (rx,ry) collides with an obstacle [ox1,oy1]-[ox2,oy2] if their occupied areas overlap. This means rx+1 >= ox1, rx <= ox2, ry+1 >= oy1, and ry <= oy2. Effectively, the forbidden (rx,ry) regions are:\n        *   Z1 (from SO1): rx in [4,7], ry in [0,15].\n        *   Z2 (from SO2): rx in [9,20], ry in [19,28]. (ry_max=28 for robot BL corner).\n        *   Z3 (from SO3): rx in [14,28], ry in [4,10]. (rx_max=28 for robot BL corner).\n    *   **Pedestrians**: Trajectories (t,px,py) given. A pedestrian at (px,py) occupies [px,px+1]x[py,py+1].\n        A robot at (rx,ry) collides with a pedestrian at (px,py) if abs(rx-px) <= 1 AND abs(ry-py) <= 1. This means (rx,ry) is forbidden if rx is in [px-1, px+1] AND ry is in [py-1, py+1] (clipped to [0,28]). This check is done for each pedestrian at each time t.\n\n3.  **Robot Constraints**:\n    *   Robot 1: Start (0,17,2), End (19,5,24).\n    *   Robot 2: Start (0,5,25), End (19,25,25).\n    *   Speed Limit: Max change of 2 units in x and 2 units in y per time step (|dx|<=2, |dy|<=2).\n\n4.  **Pathfinding Approach (A*)**:\n    *   Algorithm: A* search in (t,x,y) space for each robot independently (robot-robot collisions are not mentioned as a constraint).\n    *   State: (t, rx, ry), representing robot's bottom-left corner (rx,ry) at time t.\n    *   Actions: Move from (t,rx,ry) to (t+1, rx+dx, ry+dy), where dx,dy are in {-2,-1,0,1,2}. This includes waiting (dx=0,dy=0).\n    *   Cost: Each step costs 1 (time unit).\n    *   Heuristic `h`: `ceil(max(|rx - goal_x|, |ry - goal_y|) / 2.0)`. This is the minimum time steps (Chebyshev distance / max speed component) to reach goal coordinates.\n    *   Goal State: For a target (Gx,Gy), the A* aims to find a path to (19, Gx, Gy).\n    *   Safety Check: A function `is_safe(t, rx, ry)` checks against Z1, Z2, Z3, and all pedestrian positions at time t. Boundary checks (0<=rx<=28, 0<=ry<=28) are also inherently part of valid moves.\n\n5.  **Path Generation Summary**:\n    *   The paths below are manually constructed to satisfy all constraints, simulating the output of such an A* planner. They follow strategic routes around obstacles and are verified for pedestrian collision avoidance at critical points (especially start/end and any waiting periods). If the A* algorithm produced a path arriving at the goal before t=19, the robot would wait at the goal location if safe, or make small safe moves until t=19.\n    *   **Robot 1 Path Strategy**: (17,2) -> (13,2) (stay below Z3) -> (13,16) (pass west of Z3, stay west of Z1's main blockage) -> (5,16) (move above Z1) -> (5,24) (move to goal). Total path length is 17 steps, so wait at (5,24) for t=18,19.\n    *   **Robot 2 Path Strategy**: (5,25) -> (5,18) (move south to pass under Z2) -> (25,18) (move east, clear of Z2, Z1, Z3) -> (25,25) (move north to goal). Total path length 18 steps, so wait at (25,25) for t=19.", config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory1=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=15, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=13, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=13, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=13, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=13, y=8), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=13, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=13, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=13, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=13, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=11, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=9, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=7, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=5, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=5, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=5, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=5, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=5, y=24)], robot_trajectory2=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=5, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=5, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=5, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=5, y=19), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=5, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=7, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=9, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=11, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=13, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=15, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=17, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=19, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=21, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=23, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=25, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=25, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=25, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=25, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=25, y=25)])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'robot1: Start position correct': True, 'robot1: End position correct': True, 'robot1: Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'robot1: Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'robot1: Over Speed limit': False, 'robot2: Start position correct': True, 'robot2: End position correct': True, 'robot2: Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'robot2: Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'robot2: Over Speed limit': False}, 'score': 100.0}
