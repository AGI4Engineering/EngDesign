{'completion_tokens': 5146, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='We need to generate two collision‐free 20‐step (t=0..19) trajectories for two 2×2 robots on a 30×30 grid with three rectangular static obstacles and three moving 2×2 pedestrians. Each robot may move at most ±2 in X and ±2 in Y per time step, must begin and end at the specified coordinates, and never overlap (even at edges) with obstacles or pedestrians.\n\nStatic obstacles:\nObs1: x∈[5,7], y∈[0,15]\nObs2: x∈[10,20], y∈[20,30]\nObs3: x∈[15,30], y∈[5,10]\n\nPedestrian trajectories (bottom-left of their 2×2 square) are given for t=0..19; we ensure robots never occupy any 2×2 cell that overlaps those of any ped at the same t.\n\nRobot 1: start (17,2) → goal (5,24). Because Obs3 blocks x≥15 for y=5..10, the robot moves immediately left off x≥15 to avoid colliding with ped3 (which passes (17,2) at t=8) and to clear the lower‐right corridor before y=5. Then it ascends in the clear middle band (x≈9), rises above Obs1 (y>15), crosses left around x≈7–5, and finally climbs to y=24 at x=5 below Obs2. This path respects max ±2 per step, avoids all static rectangles, and steps away from all three pedestrian 2×2 boxes.\n\nRobot 2: start (5,25) → goal (25,25). Obs2 (x=10..20, y=20..30) blocks the direct high‐y route, so the robot first descends along x=5 to y=17, circumnavigating Obs1 (which ends at y=15) and staying above Obs3 (which ends at y=10). Then it crosses east beneath Obs2 at y=17 through x=5..23 (max ±2 steps each time), then ascends back to y=25 around x=23..25. All intermediate positions avoid static obstacles and pedestrians, and speed constraints are never violated.\n\nBoth trajectories start and end at the correct times and coordinates (t=0 at start, t=19 at goal).', config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory1=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=15, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=13, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=11, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=9, y=3), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=9, y=5), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=9, y=7), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=9, y=9), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=9, y=11), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=9, y=13), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=9, y=15), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=9, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=7, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=5, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=5, y=19), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=5, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=5, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=5, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=5, y=24)], robot_trajectory2=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=5, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=5, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=5, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=5, y=19), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=5, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=5, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=7, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=9, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=11, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=13, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=15, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=17, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=19, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=21, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=23, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=23, y=19), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=23, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=23, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=23, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=25, y=25)])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'robot1: Start position correct': True, 'robot1: End position correct': True, 'robot1: Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'robot1: Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'robot1: Over Speed limit': False, 'robot2: Start position correct': True, 'robot2: End position correct': True, 'robot2: Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'robot2: Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'robot2: Over Speed limit': False}, 'score': 100.0}
