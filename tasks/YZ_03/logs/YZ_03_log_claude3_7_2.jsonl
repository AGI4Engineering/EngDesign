For D, I'll choose a value within the given range: D = 0.055 m\n\n2. For r, I need to satisfy both r < 0.0005 and r < D/(20*3.14):\n   D/(20*3.14) = 0.055/(20*3.14) ≈ 0.00088\n   Therefore, I'll choose r = 0.0004 m, which satisfies both constraints.\n\n3. For optimal axial mode operation at the center frequency (1.65 GHz):\n   - Wavelength at 1.65 GHz: λ = c/f = 3×10^8/1.65×10^9 = 0.182 m\n   - Circumference of helix should be approximately one wavelength: C = πD ≈ λ\n   - With D = 0.055 m, C = π×0.055 ≈ 0.173 m, which is close to λ = 0.182 m\n\n4. For pitch, a common choice for axial mode is 12-14 degrees. I'll choose pitch = 12 degrees, which is > 5 degrees.\n\n5. For the number of turns, typically 3-15 turns are used. More turns increase directivity. I'll choose turns = 8 as a starting point.\n\n6. For the ground plane, side > 0.3 is required. A common practice is to have a ground plane with a diameter of at least 0.75λ. \n   So side = 0.75λ = 0.75×0.182 = 0.1365 m is a minimum.\n   However, since we need side > 0.3, I'll set side = 0.35 m.\n\nThese parameters should result in a helical antenna with a directivity around 13 dBi and an axial ratio < 1.5, which satisfies our requirements. The actual performance would be confirmed through MATLAB simulation using the provided code.\n\nLet me summarize the final parameters:\n- relativeBW = 0.424\n- r = 0.0004 m\n- D = 0.055 m\n- turns = 8\n- pitch = 12 degrees\n- side = 0.35 m", relativeBW=0.424, r=0.0004, D=0.055, turns=8.0, pitch=12.0, side=0.35), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'relativeBW': 0.424, 'r': 0.0004, 'D': 0.055, 'turns': 8.0, 'pitch': 12.0, 'side': 0.35, 'Direc_at_low': 12.236938340155877, 'Direc_at_center': 11.58738528013763, 'Direc_at_high': 12.850725215859043, 'ar_dB': 0.44921154222885795, 'check_1': True, 'check_2': True, 'check_3': True, 'check_4': True, 'check_5': True}, 'score': 100.0}
