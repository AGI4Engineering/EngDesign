For D, I'll choose a value in the middle of the allowed range: D = 0.055 m\n\n2. For r, I need to satisfy r < 0.0005 and r < D/(20*3.14):\n   r < D/(20*3.14) = 0.055/(20*3.14) ≈ 0.000876\n   Since r < 0.0005 is more restrictive, I'll choose r = 0.0004 m\n\n3. For pitch, I need pitch > 5 deg. For helical antennas in axial mode, a typical pitch angle is around 12-14 degrees. Let's choose pitch = 12 degrees.\n\n4. For side, I need side > 0.3. The ground plane size should be at least λ/2 × λ/2 at the lowest frequency. At 1.3 GHz, λ ≈ 0.231 m, so λ/2 ≈ 0.115 m.\n   For better performance, ground planes are often larger, around λ × λ. Let's choose side = 0.35 m (which is > 0.3 as required).\n\n5. For turns, typical values for axial mode helical antennas are between 6 and 15 turns. The number of turns affects the gain and bandwidth. More turns generally give higher gain but narrower bandwidth. Since we have a relatively wide bandwidth (relative BW = 0.4242), I'll choose turns = 8 to balance gain and bandwidth requirements.\n\nWith these parameters, the helical antenna should produce a circularly polarized radiation with a directivity in the range of 13 dBi ± 1.5 dBi and an axial ratio < 1.5 as required.", relativeBW=0.4242, r=0.0004, D=0.055, turns=8.0, pitch=12.0, side=0.35), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'relativeBW': 0.4242, 'r': 0.0004, 'D': 0.055, 'turns': 8.0, 'pitch': 12.0, 'side': 0.35, 'Direc_at_low': 12.236938340155877, 'Direc_at_center': 11.58738528013763, 'Direc_at_high': 12.850725215859043, 'ar_dB': 0.44921154222885795, 'check_1': True, 'check_2': True, 'check_3': True, 'check_4': True, 'check_5': True}, 'score': 100.0}
