For standard helical antennas, directivity increases with the number of turns. For our frequency range and desired directivity of around 13 dBi, approximately 6-7 turns should work well.\n\nLet's choose turns = 7\n\nFor the ground plane, we need side > 0.3. Let's choose side = 0.35 m, which is larger than the minimum required.\n\nThese parameters should provide a good starting point for a helical antenna that meets the specified requirements for directivity variation and axial ratio in the given frequency range.", relativeBW=0.4242, r=0.0004, D=0.055, turns=7.0, pitch=12.0, side=0.35), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'relativeBW': 0.4242, 'r': 0.0004, 'D': 0.055, 'turns': 7.0, 'pitch': 12.0, 'side': 0.35, 'Direc_at_low': 12.0335558308364, 'Direc_at_center': 11.342507021318593, 'Direc_at_high': 12.395762875017374, 'ar_dB': 1.6432715336821613, 'check_1': True, 'check_2': True, 'check_3': False, 'check_4': True, 'check_5': False}, 'score': 60.0}
