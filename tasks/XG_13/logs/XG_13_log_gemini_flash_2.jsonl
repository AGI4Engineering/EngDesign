The controller transfer function is:\\n\\n$$C(s) = K_p + \\\\frac{K_i}{s} + K_d s$$\\n\\nWe can start by trying a PD controller (i.e., $K_i = 0$). This will help improve the settling time and reduce overshoot.  Next, since a zero steady-state error is desired, an integral term will be added to form a PID controller. The open-loop transfer function with the PID controller is:\\n\\n$$G_{OL}(s) = C(s)G(s) = (K_p + \\\\frac{K_i}{s} + K_d s) \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + 10s + 20}$$\\n\\nThe closed-loop transfer function is:\\n\\n$$G_{CL}(s) = \\\\frac{G_{OL}(s)}{1 + G_{OL}(s)}$$\\n\\nLet's aim for a settling time less than 0.2 seconds. This implies a desired closed-loop pole location with a real part of $-\\\\frac{4}{T_s} = -\\\\frac{4}{0.2} = -20$. Also, an overshoot less than 5% means a damping ratio of approximately 0.7 or higher. So, let us choose $K_p = 500$, $K_i = 1000$ and $K_d = 50$.\\n\\nWith these values, the closed-loop system should satisfy the requirements. An exact confirmation would require simulations and potentially further tuning. However, these are reasonable starting values based on control design principles.\" config=ConfigFile(Kp=500.0, Ki=1000.0, Kd=50.0)", "passed": true, "evaluation_result": {"Stability": true, "Settling Time (s)": 0.08011049723756905, "Overshoot (%)": 8.881784197001252e-14}, "score": 100}
