The rationale behind these choices is to substantially increase the closed-loop bandwidth with a high proportional term, add an integrator for zero steady-state error, and use a moderate derivative gain if needed to limit overshoot. In practice, one would fine-tune these gains by simulation or by applying a tuning method (e.g., root-locus or frequency-response-based tuning) to confirm performance requirements are met.', config=ConfigFile(Kp=600.0, Ki=1000.0, Kd=20.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Stability': True, 'Settling Time (s)': np.float64(0.3128054740957967), 'Overshoot (%)': np.float64(15.726897345846712)}, 'score': 70}
