The equation of motion is: m·ẍ + b·ẋ + k·x = F\n\nTaking the Laplace transform with zero initial conditions:\nG(s) = X(s)/F(s) = 1/(s² + 10s + 20)\n\nNow, I'll design a controller to meet these requirements:\n- Settling time Ts < 0.2 seconds\n- Overshoot Mp < 5%\n- Zero steady-state error\n\nFor the overshoot requirement of Mp < 5%, we need a damping ratio ζ ≈ 0.7. For the settling time requirement Ts < 0.2s, we need ζωn > 20 (since Ts ≈ 4/ζωn).\n\nWith ζ = 0.7071 (to be precise) and setting real parts of the dominant poles at -20, we get ωn = 28.28 rad/s.\n\nI'll design a PID controller and place the closed-loop poles at s₁,₂ = -20 ± 20j and s₃ = -20.\n\nThis gives a characteristic equation: (s² + 40s + 800)(s + 20) = s³ + 60s² + 1600s + 16000\n\nComparing with the closed-loop characteristic equation using a PID controller:\ns³ + (10 + Kd)s² + (20 + Kp)s + Ki = 0\n\nEquating coefficients:\n10 + Kd = 60\n20 + Kp = 1600\nKi = 16000\n\nSolving for the PID parameters:\nKd = 50\nKp = 1580\nKi = 16000\n\nChecking our design:\n- Settling time: Ts = 4/20 = 0.2s ✓\n- Overshoot: Mp = e^(-π·0.7071/0.7071) ≈ 4.3% < 5% ✓\n- Steady-state error: Zero (due to integral action) ✓\n\nAfter reviewing these values and considering implementation constraints, I'll adjust to slightly more practical values while maintaining performance requirements.", config=ConfigFile(Kp=1580.0, Ki=16000.0, Kd=50.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Stability': True, 'Settling Time (s)': np.float64(0.23480662983425413), 'Overshoot (%)': np.float64(21.064806800104495)}, 'score': 70}
