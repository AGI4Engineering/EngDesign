{"completion_tokens": 1569, "response": "reasoning=\"The task is to design a PID controller (Kp, Ki, Kd) for a given mass-spring-damper system such that the closed-loop system satisfies specific performance requirements: Settling time (Ts) < 0.2 seconds, Overshoot (Mp) < 5%, and zero Steady-state error (ess) for a step input.\\n\\nStep 1: System Modeling\\nThe equation of motion for the mass-spring-damper system is m*x'' + b*x' + k*x = F(t).\\nGiven parameters: m = 1 kg, b = 10 Ns/m, k = 20 N/m.\\nThe transfer function P(s) = X(s)/F(s) is:\\nP(s) = 1 / (m*s^2 + b*s + k) = 1 / (s^2 + 10s + 20)\\nThe poles of the plant P(s) are the roots of s^2 + 10s + 20 = 0. Using the quadratic formula s = [-b +/- sqrt(b^2-4ac)]/(2a):\\ns = [-10 +/- sqrt(10^2 - 4*1*20)] / 2 = [-10 +/- sqrt(100 - 80)] / 2 = [-10 +/- sqrt(20)] / 2\\ns = -5 +/- sqrt(5). So, the plant poles are p1 = -5 + sqrt(5) approx -2.764 rad/s and p2 = -5 - sqrt(5) approx -7.236 rad/s.\\n\\nStep 2: Analyze Performance Requirements\\n1.  Steady-state error (ess = 0) for a step input: This requires the system to be Type 1 (at least one integrator in the open-loop transfer function). The plant P(s) is Type 0 (no pole at s=0). A PID controller C(s) = Kp + Ki/s + Kd*s = (Kd*s^2 + Kp*s + Ki)/s includes an integrator (1/s term if Ki is non-zero). Thus, Ki must be non-zero.\\n2.  Overshoot (Mp < 5%): For a standard second-order system, Mp = exp(-\u03b6\u03c0 / sqrt(1-\u03b6^2)). Mp < 0.05 implies \u03b6 > 0.69. If the system is first-order, Mp = 0%, which also satisfies this.\\n3.  Settling time (Ts < 0.2 s): For a standard second-order system (2% criterion), Ts \u2248 4/(\u03b6\u03c9n). So, \u03b6\u03c9n > 4/0.2 = 20. For a first-order system, Ts \u2248 4\u03c4 (where \u03c4 is the time constant), so 4\u03c4 < 0.2.\\n\\nStep 3: Controller Design Strategy - PID with Pole Cancellation\\nA PID controller provides three parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd) for tuning.\\nA common and effective strategy is to use the zeros of the PID controller to cancel the poles of the plant. This simplifies the system dynamics.\\nThe PID controller transfer function is C(s) = (Kd*s^2 + Kp*s + Ki) / s.\\nThe plant transfer function is P(s) = 1 / (s^2 + 10s + 20).\\nWe want the numerator of C(s), which is (Kd*s^2 + Kp*s + Ki), to cancel the denominator of P(s), (s^2 + 10s + 20).\\nSo, we set Kd*s^2 + Kp*s + Ki = K_overall * (s^2 + 10s + 20) for some gain K_overall.\\nComparing coefficients:\\n- Kd = K_overall\\n- Kp = 10 * K_overall\\n- Ki = 20 * K_overall\\n\\nStep 4: Analyze Closed-Loop System with Pole Cancellation\\nWith this choice, the open-loop transfer function becomes:\\nC(s)P(s) = [K_overall * (s^2 + 10s + 20) / s] * [1 / (s^2 + 10s + 20)] = K_overall / s.\\nThe closed-loop transfer function T(s) for a unity feedback system is:\\nT(s) = C(s)P(s) / (1 + C(s)P(s)) = (K_overall / s) / (1 + K_overall / s) = K_overall / (s + K_overall).\\nThis is a first-order system with a single pole at s = -K_overall.\\n\\nStep 5: Determine K_overall based on Performance Requirements\\n- Steady-state error: The system T(s) has a DC gain of K_overall/K_overall = 1. For a unit step input, the output will go to 1, so ess = 0. This is also guaranteed by Ki being non-zero (as K_overall will be non-zero).\\n- Overshoot: A first-order system has no overshoot (Mp = 0%), which satisfies Mp < 5%.\\n- Settling time: For a first-order system, the settling time (Ts) using the 2% criterion is Ts = 4\u03c4, where \u03c4 = 1/K_overall is the time constant.\\n  So, Ts = 4 / K_overall.\\n  We require Ts < 0.2 s:\\n  4 / K_overall < 0.2\\n  K_overall > 4 / 0.2\\n  K_overall > 20.\\n  To satisfy this condition and provide some margin, let's choose K_overall = 25.\\n  This results in Ts = 4 / 25 = 0.16 s, which is < 0.2 s.\\n\\nStep 6: Calculate PID Parameters\\nUsing K_overall = 25:\\n- Kp = 10 * K_overall = 10 * 25 = 250\\n- Ki = 20 * K_overall = 20 * 25 = 500\\n- Kd = K_overall = 25\\n\\nThese PID parameters (Kp=250, Ki=500, Kd=25) ensure all performance requirements are met. The system will behave as a first-order system with a time constant of 1/25 = 0.04 s. This design strategy is simpler and often leads to more robust performance compared to attempting pole placement for a higher-order system, assuming accurate plant model knowledge.\" config=ConfigFile(Kp=250.0, Ki=500.0, Kd=25.0)", "passed": true, "evaluation_result": {"Stability": true, "Settling Time (s)": 0.1602209944751381, "Overshoot (%)": 6.661338147750939e-14}, "score": 100}
