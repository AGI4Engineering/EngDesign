{"completion_tokens": 1805, "response": "reasoning=\"1.  **System Analysis**: The mass-spring-damper system is described by $m = 1\\\\, \\\\text{kg}$, $b = 10\\\\, \\\\text{N s/m}$, $k = 20\\\\, \\\\text{N/m}$. The open-loop transfer function of the plant is $P(s) = \\\\frac{X(s)}{U(s)} = \\\\frac{1}{ms^2 + bs + k} = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + 10s + 20}$.\\n\\n2.  **Performance Requirements**:\\n    *   Settling time: $T_s < 0.2\\\\, \\\\text{seconds}$ (using 2% criterion, $T_s \\\\approx \\\\frac{4}{\\\\zeta \\\\omega_n}$)\\n    *   Overshoot: $M_p < 5\\\\%$ ($M_p = e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\pi \\\\zeta}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\zeta^2}}}$)\\n    *   Steady-state error: Zero for a step input (e.g., to a reference position or against a constant disturbance force F).\\n\\n3.  **Controller Choice**: A PID controller has the form $C(s) = K_p + \\\\frac{K_i}{s} + K_d s = \\\\frac{K_d s^2 + K_p s + K_i}{s}$.\\n    *   A P controller would result in a non-zero steady-state error.\\n    *   A PD controller would also result in a non-zero steady-state error for a step input.\\n    *   A PI controller can provide zero steady-state error. However, analyzing its capability: $T(s) = \\\\frac{K_p s + K_i}{s^3 + 10s^2 + (20+K_p)s + K_i}$. If we try to cancel a plant pole (e.g., at $s \\\\approx -2.764$) with the PI zero $s = -K_i/K_p$, the remaining system is $s^2 + 7.236s + K_p = 0$. Here $2\\\\zeta\\\\omega_n = 7.236$, so $\\\\zeta\\\\omega_n = 3.618$. The settling time $T_s \\\\approx 4/(3.618) \\\\approx 1.1\\\\, \\\\text{s}$, which does not meet the $T_s < 0.2\\\\, \\\\text{s}$ requirement. Thus, a PI controller is not sufficient.\\n    *   A full PID controller is necessary to meet all requirements, especially the fast settling time and zero steady-state error.\\n\\n4.  **Design Strategy: Pole-Zero Cancellation**:\\n    The plant poles are the roots of $s^2 + 10s + 20 = 0$, which are $s_{p1,2} = \\\\frac{-10 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{100 - 80}}{2} = -5 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{5}$. So, $s_{p1} \\\\approx -2.764$ and $s_{p2} \\\\approx -7.236$.\\n    The PID controller $C(s) = \\\\frac{K_d s^2 + K_p s + K_i}{s}$ has two zeros determined by $K_d s^2 + K_p s + K_i = 0$.\\n    We can choose $K_p, K_i, K_d$ such that the controller zeros cancel the plant poles. This means the numerator polynomial of the controller must be proportional to the plant's characteristic polynomial: $K_d s^2 + K_p s + K_i = K_d(s^2 + 10s + 20)$.\\n    Comparing coefficients:\\n    *   $K_p = 10 K_d$\\n    *   $K_i = 20 K_d$\\n\\n5.  **Closed-Loop System with Pole-Zero Cancellation**:\\n    The open-loop transfer function becomes $L(s) = C(s)P(s) = \\\\frac{K_d(s^2 + 10s + 20)}{s} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + 10s + 20} = \\\\frac{K_d}{s}$.\\n    The closed-loop transfer function (for reference tracking) is $T(s) = \\\\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)} = \\\\frac{K_d/s}{1+K_d/s} = \\\\frac{K_d}{s+K_d}$.\\n    This is a first-order system with time constant $\\\\tau = 1/K_d$.\\n\\n6.  **Determining $K_d$ from Performance Requirements**:\\n    *   **Settling Time**: For a first-order system, $T_s \\\\approx 4\\\\tau = 4/K_d$ (for 2% criterion). We need $T_s < 0.2\\\\, \\\\text{s}$.\\n        $4/K_d < 0.2 \\\\implies K_d > 4/0.2 \\\\implies K_d > 20$.\\n    *   **Overshoot**: A first-order system has 0% overshoot for a step input, which satisfies $M_p < 5\\\\%$.\\n    *   **Steady-State Error**: For a step reference input $R(s)=R_0/s$, the steady-state output is $y_{ss} = \\\\lim_{s\\\\to0} s T(s) R(s) = \\\\lim_{s\\\\to0} s \\\\frac{K_d}{s+K_d} \\\\frac{R_0}{s} = R_0$. Thus, $e_{ss} = R_0 - y_{ss} = 0$.\\n        If $F=1N$ is a step disturbance $D(s)=1/s$, the output due to disturbance is $X_d(s) = \\\\frac{P(s)}{1+L(s)}D(s) = \\\\frac{1/(s^2+10s+20)}{1+K_d/s} \\\\frac{1}{s} = \\\\frac{s}{(s+K_d)(s^2+10s+20)} \\\\frac{1}{s}$.\\n        $x_{d,ss} = \\\\lim_{s\\\\to0} s X_d(s) = \\\\lim_{s\\\\to0} \\\\frac{s}{(s+K_d)(s^2+10s+20)} = \\\\frac{0}{K_d \\\\cdot 20} = 0$. This also meets the zero steady-state error requirement.\\n\\n7.  **Calculating PID Gains**:\\n    Let's choose $K_d = 25$ to provide some margin for the settling time ($K_d > 20$).\\n    Then, $K_p = 10 K_d = 10 \\\\times 25 = 250$.\\n    And $K_i = 20 K_d = 20 \\\\times 25 = 500$.\\n\\n    With these gains:\\n    *   $T_s = 4/25 = 0.16\\\\, \\\\text{s}$, which is $< 0.2\\\\, \\\\text{s}$.\\n    *   $M_p = 0\\\\%$, which is $< 5\\\\%$.\\n    *   Steady-state error is zero.\\n    All performance requirements are met with this design.\" config=ConfigFile(Kp=250.0, Ki=500.0, Kd=25.0)", "passed": true, "evaluation_result": {"Stability": true, "Settling Time (s)": 0.1602209944751381, "Overshoot (%)": 6.661338147750939e-14}, "score": 100}
