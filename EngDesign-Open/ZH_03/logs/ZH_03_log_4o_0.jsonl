Let's break down the requirements and calculate the necessary parameters step by step.\n\n1. **Top Linear Velocity:**\n   - The robot must reach a top speed of at least 3.0 m/s. The wheel's rotational speed (in rad/s) can be calculated using the formula: \\( \\omega = \\frac{v}{r} \\), where \\( v \\) is the linear velocity and \\( r \\) is the wheel radius.\n   - The motor's maximum speed is 4000 rpm, which is approximately 418.88 rad/s. To achieve 3.0 m/s, the wheel radius \\( r \\) must be such that \\( \\omega \\times r = 3.0 \\). Solving for \\( r \\), we get \\( r = \\frac{3.0}{418.88} \\approx 0.00716 \\) meters. This is impractically small, so we need a gear reduction.\n   - Let's choose a wheel diameter of 0.1 meters (radius = 0.05 meters). The gear ratio \\( r \\) can then be calculated as \\( r = \\frac{418.88 \\times 0.05}{3.0} \\approx 6.98 \\). We'll round this to a practical gear ratio of 7.\n\n2. **Incline Climbing:**\n   - The robot must climb a 10-degree incline. The force required to climb is given by \\( F = m \\times g \\times \\sin(\\theta) + \\text{rolling resistance} \\), where \\( \\theta \\) is the incline angle.\n   - Assuming a robot mass of 10 kg, the force required is \\( F = 10 \\times 9.81 \\times \\sin(10^\\circ) + 0.015 \\times 10 \\times 9.81 \\approx 17.1 \\) N.\n   - The torque required at the wheel is \\( \\tau = F \\times r \\). With a wheel radius of 0.05 meters, \\( \\tau = 17.1 \\times 0.05 = 0.855 \\) Nm.\n   - The motor provides 0.3 Nm, so with a gear ratio of 7, the effective torque is \\( 0.3 \\times 7 = 2.1 \\) Nm, which is sufficient.\n\n3. **Battery Capacity:**\n   - The robot must cruise for 30 minutes at 2.5 m/s. The power required is \\( P = F \\times v \\), where \\( F \\) is the force to overcome rolling resistance.\n   - The rolling resistance force is \\( F = 0.015 \\times 10 \\times 9.81 = 1.4715 \\) N.\n   - The power required is \\( P = 1.4715 \\times 2.5 = 3.67875 \\) W.\n   - For 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the energy required is \\( 3.67875 \\times 0.5 = 1.839375 \\) Wh.\n   - Considering motor efficiency (80%), the battery capacity should be \\( \\frac{1.839375}{0.8} \\approx 2.3 \\) Wh. To ensure sufficient capacity, we'll choose a battery capacity of 5 Wh.\n\nThus, the proposed design parameters are:\n- Gear ratio: 7\n- Wheel diameter: 0.1 meters\n- Battery capacity: 5 Wh\n- Robot mass: 10 kg", config=ConfigFile(battery_capacity=5.0, gear_ratio=7.0, wheel_diameter=0.1, body_mass=10.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'v_max_mps': 2.9919930034188504, 'T_wheel_Nm': 1.6800000000000002, 'T_required_Nm': 0.9242015418841666, 'C_required_Wh': 2.2992187499999996, 'C_given': 5.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 70}
