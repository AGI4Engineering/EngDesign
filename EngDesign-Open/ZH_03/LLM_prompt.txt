## Task Description
You are tasked with designing a wheel-motor-gear system for a lightweight electric ground robot. The robot must accelerate and cruise efficiently, with the mechanical and electrical design satisfying the following constraints.

Your goal is to determine a feasible set of design parameters for:
- Gear ratio **r**
- Wheel diameter **d** (in meters)
- Battery capacity **C** (in Wh)
- Robot mass **m** (in kg)

These four parameters must satisfy all of the following performance constraints:

- The robot must reach a top linear velocity of at least **3.0 m/s**
- The robot must be able to climb a **10-degree incline** 
- The battery must support at least **30 minutes** of level cruising at **2.5 m/s** average speed without recharging

The robot has the following physical characteristics:

- Motor voltage: 24 V  
- Max torque: 0.3 Nm at 4000 rpm  
- Motor efficiency: 80%  
- Rolling resistance coefficient: 0.015  
- Robot cross-sectional area: 0.05 m²  
- Gravitational acceleration: g = 9.81 m/s²


Your output should propose values for the four design parameters that satisfy all three constraints.
