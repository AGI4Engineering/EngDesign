The objective is to find the maximum value of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), denoted as \\\\(\\\\alpha_{\\\\max}\\\\), such that the closed-loop system is absolutely stable for all nonlinearities \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) satisfying the sector condition \\\\(0 \\\\le \\\\frac{\\\\phi(v_1) - \\\\phi(v_2)}{v_1 - v_2} \\\\le 1\\\\).  Absolute stability for such systems can be analyzed using the Popov criterion or the Circle criterion, which can be formulated as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Since the sector condition is [0, 1], we can use the Zames-Falb criterion. The Zames-Falb criterion uses the KYP lemma to formulate an LMI that determines the stability. Bisection can then be used to find the maximal value of alpha that satisfies the LMI. Because I don't have access to external tools to numerically solve the LMI problem and bisection, I can't get an exact numerical answer, so I provide a placeholder.\" config=ConfigFile(alpha=0.5)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"alpha": 0.5}, "score": 70.0}
