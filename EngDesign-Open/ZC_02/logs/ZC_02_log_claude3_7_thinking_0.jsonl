For a nonlinearity in the sector [0,1] with negative feedback, the system is absolutely stable if and only if the Nyquist plot of G(z) = C(zI-A)^(-1)αB + D lies strictly to the right of the vertical line through (-1,0) in the complex plane.\n\nThis is equivalent to: Re(G(e^(jω))) > -1 for all ω ∈ [0, 2π)\n\nStep 1: Compute the transfer function G(z).\nG(z) = C(zI-A)^(-1)αB + D\nSince D = 0, we have G(z) = C(zI-A)^(-1)αB\n\nLet's compute (zI-A)^(-1):\nzI-A = [z-0.5, 0; -1, z]\ndet(zI-A) = (z-0.5)z = z²-0.5z\n(zI-A)^(-1) = 1/(z²-0.5z) * [z, 0; 1, z-0.5]\n\nNow, G(z) = [2, 0.92] * 1/(z²-0.5z) * [z, 0; 1, z-0.5] * [1; 0] * α\n= α * (2z + 0.92)/(z²-0.5z)\n= α * (2z + 0.92)/(z(z-0.5))\n\nStep 2: Find the minimum value of Re(G'(e^(jω))) where G'(z) = G(z)/α.\nFor G'(z) = (2z + 0.92)/(z(z-0.5)), I'll substitute z = e^(jω) and compute the real part.\n\nAfter rationalization and simplification:\nRe(G'(e^(jω))) = (1.54cos(ω) - 1.0 + 0.92cos(2ω))/(1.25 - cos(ω))\n\nI need to find the minimum value of this expression over ω ∈ [0, 2π).\n\nTesting various values of ω:\nAt ω = 0: Re(G'(e^(j0))) = (1.54 - 1.0 + 0.92)/(1.25-1) = 5.84\nAt ω = π/2: Re(G'(e^(jπ/2))) = (-1.0 - 0.92)/1.25 = -1.536\nAt ω = π: Re(G'(e^(jπ))) = (-1.54 - 1.0 + 0.92)/2.25 = -0.72\n\nChecking points near π/2 confirms that the minimum occurs at ω = π/2 with a value of -1.536.\n\nStep 3: Calculate α_max.\nThe system is absolutely stable if and only if α < 1/|min_ω Re(G'(e^(jω)))|\nSince min_ω Re(G'(e^(jω))) = -1.536, we have α_max = 1/1.536 ≈ 0.651\n\nTherefore, α_max = 0.651 is the maximum value for which the system is absolutely stable for all nonlinearities in the sector [0,1].", config=ConfigFile(alpha=0.651)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'alpha': 0.651}, 'score': 95.0}
