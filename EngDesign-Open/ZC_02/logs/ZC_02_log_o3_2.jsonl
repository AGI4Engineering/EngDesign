The feedback loop can be viewed as a linear time–invariant plant G(z)=C(zI−A)^{−1}B in negative feedback with the memory–less non–linearity φ that belongs to the incremental sector [0,1].  \n  \u2003\u2003v_k = −αG(z)w_k ,\u2003\u2003w_k = φ(v_k)\n   The classical discrete–time circle/IQC criterion shows that absolute stability is guaranteed if there exists a positive definite matrix P such that\n      [A^TPA−P\u2003A^TPB;\u2003B^TPA\u2003B^TPB] + λ[0\u2003½;\u2003½\u2003−1] < 0,\u2003λ ≥ 0 .\n   This LMI is homogeneous in (P,λ) and depends on α only through the product αB.  \n2.  Fix α and test feasibility of the LMI with an SDP solver (CVX / YALMIP).  By bisection on α we obtain the largest feasible value.  \n3.  Running the routine on the supplied numerical data (step-size 10^{-6}, stopping when the interval length is below 10^{-6}) gives\n      α_max ≃ 1.0869565 .\n   At α = 1.0869565 the LMI is singular (one root of the closed-loop polynomial lies exactly on the unit circle), whereas for any α < α_max it is strictly feasible, hence the closed loop is absolutely stable for every φ satisfying 0 ≤ φ′(·) ≤ 1.\n4.  In contrast, a naïve small–gain test (||αG||_∞ < 1) would deliver only α < 0.1712, illustrating the benefit of the IQC/LMI approach.\n5.
