{'completion_tokens': 8397, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Below is a brief outline of one way to arrive at α_max without having to resort to a full‐blown LMI or Popov‐type SDP.  In this particular example, the ‘worst‐case’ slope in the sector [0,1] is simply unity, so one may check stability of the linear map obtained by replacing φ(v)=v.\n\n1) With w_k = v_k, the closed loop becomes x(k+1) = (A − α B C) x(k).  In our example:\n   A = [0.5   0   ]\n       [1.0   0   ],\n   B C = [ [2.0    0.92]\n            [0      0   ] ],\n   so   (A − α B C) = [   0.5 − 2α      −0.92 α  ]\n                     [    1.0                0     ].\n\n2) The characteristic polynomial of M = (A − α B C) is:\n   det(z I − M ) = z² − (0.5 − 2 α)z + 0.92 α .\n   If we write z² + p z + q = 0 with p = 2 α − 0.5 and q = 0.92 α, we check when a root meets |z|=1.\n\n3) By the usual discrete‐time stability or ‘Jury’ arguments, it emerges that the first boundary crossing with the unit circle is at α = 1 / 0.92 ≈ 1.087, from a pair of complex‐conjugate roots.  Hence the largest α such that all solutions remain stable for every slope‐bounded φ with slope in [0,1] is α ≈ 1.087.', config=ConfigFile(alpha=1.0869565217391304)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'alpha': 1.0869565217391304}, 'score': 95.0}
