In that case the closed‐loop becomes purely linear with loop gain 1.\n\nStep 2:  Closed‐loop A‐matrix for φ(v)=v\n   wₖ=vₖ,  vₖ = –yₖ = –C xₖ ⇒ wₖ = –C xₖ.  Hence\n     xₖ₊₁ = A xₖ + α B (–C xₖ) = (A – α B C)xₖ.\nCompute\n  A – α B C = [[0.5, 0]; [1, 0]] – α * [[1];[0]]*[2,0.92]\n            = [[0.5–2α,    –0.92α];\n               [     1,       0  ]].\nIts characteristic polynomial is\n  λ² – (0.5–2α)λ + (0.92α) = 0.\n\nStep 3:  Schur‐stability of a second‐order polynomial\nA polynomial λ² + b λ + c is Schur‐stable iff\n   (i)   |c| < 1,\n   (ii)  1 + b + c > 0,\n   (iii) 1 – b + c > 0.\nIn our case b = –(0.5–2α) = –0.5 +2α,  c = 0.92α.  Checking (ii),(iii) at α>0 always holds for reasonable α, so the limiting condition is |c|<1 ⇒ 0.92α < 1 ⇒ α < 1/0.92 ≈ 1.0869565.\n\nStep 4:  Absolute‐stability conclusion\nBecause for any α ≥ 1/0.92 the linear closed‐loop with φ(v)=v is unstable, the interconnection cannot be absolutely stable for all φ in the sector.  Conversely, if α < 1/0.92 the loop with φ(v)=v is Schur‐stable, and any φ of lesser or equal slope can only reduce the loop gain, preserving stability.  Therefore the largest α guaranteeing absolute stability is\n\n   αₘₐₓ = 1 / 0.92 ≈ 1.0869565217.\n\nOne can of course recover the same result via the discrete‐time circle criterion or by casting the problem in an LMI with an S‐procedure multiplier λ ≥0 and performing bisection in α, but the simplest check is the linear φ(v)=v test described above.', config=ConfigFile(alpha=1.0869565217)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'alpha': 1.0869565217}, 'score': 95.0}
