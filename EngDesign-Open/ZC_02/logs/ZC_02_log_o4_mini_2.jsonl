A classical necessary condition for absolute stability is that the linearization at the worst‐case slope φ′=1 is stable.  Replacing φ by the gain 1, the closed‐loop state‐matrix becomes\n\n    A_cl = A + B·C·1·α\n         = [[0.5, 0]    + α·[[1],[0]]·[2,0.92]\n            [1  , 0]]        \n         = [[0.5+2α , 0.92α]\n            [1      ,   0   ]].\n\nThe characteristic polynomial is\n\n    det(zI − A_cl) = z² − (0.5+2α) z − 0.92α = 0.\n\nClosed‐loop stability requires all roots z satisfy |z|<1.  The boundary of stability occurs when there is a root at z=1.  Substituting z=1 gives\n\n    1 − (0.5+2α)·1 − 0.92α = 0\n    ⇒ 1 − 0.5 − 2α − 0.92α = 0\n    ⇒ 0.5 − 2.92α = 0\n    ⇒ α = 0.5/2.92 ≃ 0.171233.\n\nFor α any larger, the linearization with φ′=1 acquires at least one pole with |z|≥1, so the feedback could become unstable.  For all φ with slope in [0,1], the absolute‐stability region cannot exceed this value.  Conversely, for 0<α<0.171233 the linearized closed‐loop is Schur, and by standard small‐gain or circle‐criterion arguments the full nonlinear interconnection remains absolutely stable.  Therefore the maximal α is\n\n    αₘₐₓ = 0.5/2.92 ≃ 0.171233.', config=ConfigFile(alpha=0.171233)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'alpha': 0.171233}, 'score': 0.0}
