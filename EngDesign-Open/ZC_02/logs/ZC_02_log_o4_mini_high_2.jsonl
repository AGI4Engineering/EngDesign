By the circle criterion, it suffices to test phi = 0 and phi(v) = v. For phi = 0, the loop x(k+1) = A x(k) has eigenvalues 0 and 0.5 in the unit disc. For phi(v) = v, the closed-loop matrix is A - alpha B C with characteristic polynomial z^2 + (2 alpha - 0.5) z + 0.92 alpha. The Schur condition |0.92 alpha| < 1 implies alpha < 1/0.92 ≈ 1.08696, and the other conditions are less restrictive. Thus the maximal stability margin is alpha_max = 1/0.92 ≈ 1.08696.', config=ConfigFile(alpha=1.08696)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'alpha': 1.08696}, 'score': 95.0}
