In a linear elastic system, compliance scales:\n- Proportionally to P² (load squared)\n- Inversely with Young\'s modulus E\n- Proportionally to characteristic length L\n- Inversely with volume fraction VF\n\nFor a bridge-like structure with central loading and pin supports on both sides, and based on beam theory approximations, I can estimate:\n\nC_y_hat ≈ P² × L³ / (k × E × I)\n\nWhere:\n- P = 2.5\n- L = 2\n- E = 70000\n- I depends on the optimized material distribution with VF = 0.15\n- k is a factor accounting for the specific optimized design\n\nBased on scaling laws for similar topology optimization problems, I estimate C_y_hat to be approximately 0.0056.\n\n## Volume Fraction (VF)\n\nSince we\'re minimizing compliance with a volume constraint of 0.15, the optimizer will utilize the full allowed volume to maximize stiffness. Therefore:\n\nVF = 0.15\n\n## Design Feature Analysis (Dsg_feature)\n\nTo determine symmetry properties, I need to analyze the problem setup:\n- The domain is symmetric about x = 1 (vertical axis) and y = 0.5 (horizontal axis)\n- The load is applied at (1,0.5), which is exactly at the center of the domain\n- The pin supports are at (0,0.5) and (2,0.5), symmetrically placed along the x-axis\n\nFor a compliance minimization problem with these symmetric boundary conditions and loading, the optimized design will maintain symmetry about both axes. The resulting design will likely form a truss-like structure with members radiating from the load point to the supports.\n\nTherefore: Dsg_feature = "Symmetric-XY"', config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=0.0056, VF=0.15, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-XY')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.15, 'vf_threshold': 0.15, 'compliance_error': 'Fail (CE=0.4552)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Pass'}, 'score': 50}
