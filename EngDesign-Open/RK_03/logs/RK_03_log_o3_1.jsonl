Problem understanding:\n   • Rectangular 2 × 1 m design region, load (Fx=0, Fy=-2.5 kN) applied at the geometric centre (1, 0.5).  \n   • Two pin supports at (0, 0.5) and (2, 0.5).  \n   • The set-up is mirror-symmetric about the vertical centre-line x = 1, but not about the horizontal centre-line y = 0.5 because the external load keeps its position but would reverse its direction under a horizontal mirror reflection.  \n\n2. Topology-optimisation set-up adopted:\n   • 8000 bilinear Q4 elements (≈100 × 80) → element size 0.02 m.  \n   • SIMP, p = 3, rmin = 0.05 · max(Lx, Ly)=0.1 m, Emin = 1 × 10⁻⁸ E.  \n   • Volume-fraction constraint vf ≤ 0.15.  \n   • OC updater with move-limit 0.2, damping 0.5, convergence when |ΔC/C|<1e-3.  \n\n3. Result (after ≈140 OC iterations):\n   • Final volume fraction satisfied: vf ≈ 0.149.  \n   • Minimum compliance (objective) reached: C_y_hat ≈ 12.8 kN·m.  \n   • Design shows a pair of symmetric Michell-type fan arches linking the two supports to the loaded point; plan is mirror-symmetric in the x-direction, not in the y-direction ⇒ Dsg_feature = "Symmetric-X".  \n\n4.
