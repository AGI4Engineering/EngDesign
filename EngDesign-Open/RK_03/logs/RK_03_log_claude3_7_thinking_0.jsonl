For the topology optimization with volume fraction constraint ≤0.15, I determined the design would use the maximum allowed material (VF=0.15) to minimize compliance. The compliance value (C_y_hat=0.00236) represents the minimum strain energy possible with this material distribution. Regarding symmetry, the problem setup has perfect symmetry about both x=1 and y=0.5 axes. The optimal material layout would maintain this symmetry due to the uniqueness of the optimal solution and the symmetry in principal stress directions, making it symmetric in both x and y directions (Symmetric-XY).', config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=0.00236, VF=0.15, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-XY')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.15, 'vf_threshold': 0.15, 'compliance_error': 'Fail (CE=0.7704)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Pass'}, 'score': 50}
