{'completion_tokens': 5508, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Problem setup: We have a 2×1 rectangular domain, pinned at (0,0.5) and (2,0.5), loaded downward (2.5 units) at (1,0.5). Material: E=70000, ν=0.3, SIMP with exponent p=3, relative stiffness k0=1e-8, filter radius R=0.1.\n2. Symmetry: The domain geometry, supports, and loading are symmetric about both x=1 (vertical) and y=0.5 (horizontal), so the optimized layout will be symmetric in both x and y.\n3. Volume fraction: The allowed volume fraction is maximum 0.15. The optimizer effectively uses the full budget, yielding VF ≈ 0.15.\n4. Compliance estimate: Model the design as a simply supported beam with cross-sectional area = VF×domain area = 0.15×2 = 0.3, midpoint load P=2.5, deflection δ = P·L³/(48·E·I) with I = (thickness³)/12 and thickness = 0.15. Calculating gives δ ≈ 0.0212 and compliance C = P·δ ≈ 0.0529. The topology-optimized layout typically matches or slightly improves on this, so we take C_y_hat ≈ 0.0529.\n5. Final results:\n   - C_y_hat = 0.0529\n   - VF = 0.15\n   - Dsg_feature = "Symmetric-XY"', config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=0.0529, VF=0.15, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-XY')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.15, 'vf_threshold': 0.15, 'compliance_error': 'Fail (CE=4.1460)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Pass'}, 'score': 50}
