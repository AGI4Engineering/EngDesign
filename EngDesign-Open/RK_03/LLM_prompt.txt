## Task Description

This is a michell structure problem. 
Design domain is a 2D rectangular region in cartesian coordinates, with vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (2,1), (0,1). 
A vertically downward load of magnitude 2.5 is applied at (1,0.5) uniformly over small area of length 0.05. Pin supports are at (0,0.5) and at (2,0.5). 
Solid material parameters are Young's modulus, E = 70000, and Poisson's ratio, nu = 0.3. Assume density-based SIMP approch with relative void stiffness factor 1e-8.
Lx = 2 and Ly = 1 denotes the domain lengths in x- and y-directions. The filter radius is R = 0.05*max(Lx,Ly), and the filter exponent is 3.
Total number of elements in the discretized domain is approximately 8000.

### Task

Your task is to:
- Obtain a topology optimized design that has minimum structural compliance and volume fraction not exceeding 0.15.
- Given the optimized design, output the corresponding minimum structural compliance, named C_y_hat, and also its volume fraction, named vf, in numerical numbers. Note that vf is in the range of [0,1].
- Check if the optimized design is 'symmetric' or 'asymmetric' in x- and y-directions. Give the output 'Asymmetric-XY' if not symmetric in both x- and y-directions, 'Symmetric-Y' if symmetric in y-direction but not in x-direction, 'Symmetric-X' if symmetric in x-direction but not in y-direction, and 'Symmetric-XY' if symmetric in both x- and y-directions. Output this in a variable named Dsg_feature.
