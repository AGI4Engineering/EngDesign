## Task Description

You are designing control parameters for a **Switched Capacitor Battery Balancing System** involving active balancing of three Li-ion battery cells connected in series.

The system uses:
- 2 capacitors and 6 bidirectional switches (active balancing architecture)
- Initial state of charge (SOC) of each cell:
  - Cell 1: 0.70
  - Cell 2: 0.75
  - Cell 3: 0.80
- PWM switching for UP and DOWN phases:
  - Switching period (Tper) = 0.006 seconds
  - 50% duty cycle
  - 180Â° interleaving
- CC-CV Battery control block:
  - Maximum voltage vMax = 4.1 V
  - PI controller: Kp = 100, Ki = 10
- Charge and discharge behavior controlled by relay toggling logic

You must propose control parameters that allow safe, efficient, and effective balancing.

## Your Task

You are tasked with proposing **four numerical values** that control balancing behavior:

1. `lowest_current`:
   - The **smallest balancing current** (in Amperes) that could reasonably allow balancing progress.
2. `highest_current`:
   - The **maximum allowable balancing current** (in Amperes) without causing SOC instability.
3. `on_threshold`:
   - The **SOC level** at which the relay should **stop charging** (start discharging).
4. `off_threshold`:
   - The **SOC level** at which the relay should **resume charging** after discharge.

## Output Format

You must **only** return the following exact Python dictionary format:

```python
{
  "lowest_current": YOUR_VALUE,
  "highest_current": YOUR_VALUE,
  "on_threshold": YOUR_VALUE,
  "off_threshold": YOUR_VALUE
}
