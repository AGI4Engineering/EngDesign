We have 3 Li-ion cells connected in series with initial SOC values of 0.70, 0.75, and 0.80\n2. The system uses switched capacitor active balancing with 6 switches and 2 capacitors\n3. PWM switching at 0.006 seconds period (≈167 Hz) with 50% duty cycle and 180° interleaving\n4. The graph shows SOC over time for the three cells, with initial values as specified\n\nFor balancing currents:\n- Looking at the circuit diagram and considering typical Li-ion cells, I need to determine reasonable current limits\n- For the lowest current, it needs to be sufficient to make progress in balancing but not too small\n- For highest current, it should be high enough for efficient balancing but not so high as to risk cell stability\n- Considering typical Li-ion cell capacities (~2-3Ah) and the switching frequency used (167Hz), a reasonable balancing current range would be between 0.1A and 1.0A\n- The lowest current (0.1A) would still provide meaningful balancing while being gentle on the cells\n- The highest current (1.0A) would provide faster balancing without risking instability at the given switching frequency\n\nFor the threshold values:\n- Looking at the SOC graph, I can see the cells start at 0.70-0.80 and gradually decrease\n- The relay toggles between charging and discharging to manage battery SOC\n- Based on the initial cell SOCs and typical Li-ion operation, reasonable thresholds would be:\n  - on_threshold: 0.85 (stop charging when any cell reaches 85% SOC)\n  - off_threshold: 0.55 (resume charging when any cell drops to 55% SOC)\n- These thresholds prevent overcharging while allowing sufficient discharge depth for efficient cycling\n\nThese values should provide safe, effective balancing operation with reasonable performance.", config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.1, highest_current=1.0, on_threshold=0.85, off_threshold=0.55)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.1, 'highest_current': 1.0, 'on_threshold': 0.85, 'off_threshold': 0.55, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
