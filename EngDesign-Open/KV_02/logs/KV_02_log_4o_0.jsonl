{'completion_tokens': 306, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design the control parameters for the Switched Capacitor Battery Balancing System, we need to ensure safe and efficient balancing of the Li-ion cells. The initial SOCs are 0.70, 0.75, and 0.80 for cells 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The balancing system should aim to equalize these SOCs without causing instability or overcharging.\n\n1. **Lowest Current**: This should be a small value that allows balancing to progress without causing excessive heat or inefficiency. A value of 0.1 A is reasonable for a slow and steady balancing process.\n\n2. **Highest Current**: This should be high enough to allow effective balancing but not so high as to cause instability or damage. A value of 2.0 A is a safe upper limit for balancing current in many battery systems.\n\n3. **On Threshold**: The SOC level at which charging should stop to prevent overcharging. Since the maximum voltage is 4.1 V, an SOC of 0.95 is a safe threshold to stop charging.\n\n4. **Off Threshold**: The SOC level at which charging can resume after discharging. A value of 0.65 ensures that the cells are not over-discharged and can safely resume charging.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.1, highest_current=2.0, on_threshold=0.95, off_threshold=0.65)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.1, 'highest_current': 2.0, 'on_threshold': 0.95, 'off_threshold': 0.65, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
