{'completion_tokens': 2746, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To determine appropriate control parameters for the switched capacitor battery balancing system, I'll analyze each required value systematically:\n\n1. Lowest Current:\n   - For active balancing in Li-ion cells, currents below 100mA are typically too small to effectively transfer charge between cells\n   - With the 6ms switching period and 50% duty cycle, pulsed current transfer needs a reasonable minimum threshold\n   - The initial SOC imbalance is relatively small (0.70, 0.75, 0.80), so gentle balancing can be effective\n   - 0.1A provides a reasonable minimum that allows progress without being too slow\n\n2. Highest Current:\n   - The maximum current must avoid thermal stress or SOC instability\n   - For a 3-cell Li-ion pack with active balancing, exceeding 2A typically introduces instability\n   - Given the aggressive PI controller (Kp=100, Ki=10), a conservative upper limit is needed\n   - The graph shows stable behavior with 1.5A as a reasonable maximum\n\n3. On Threshold:\n   - From the graph, the cells reach maximum SOC around sample 2000\n   - Cell 3 peaks at approximately 0.85 SOC when charging stops\n   - This suggests 0.85 is an appropriate threshold to switch from charging to discharging\n\n4. Off Threshold:\n   - A sufficient hysteresis (gap between on/off thresholds) prevents frequent relay toggling\n   - 0.1 SOC units of separation is generally recommended for stable operation\n   - 0.75 provides reasonable hysteresis while maintaining good operational capacity\n   - This value also aligns with the middle cell's initial SOC, creating a balanced cycling pattern", config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.1, highest_current=1.5, on_threshold=0.85, off_threshold=0.75)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.1, 'highest_current': 1.5, 'on_threshold': 0.85, 'off_threshold': 0.75, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
