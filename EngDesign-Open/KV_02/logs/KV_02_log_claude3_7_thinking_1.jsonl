{'completion_tokens': 1299, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I need to determine appropriate control parameters for this switched capacitor battery balancing system by analyzing the circuit diagram and SOC graph.\n\n1. For `lowest_current`: Looking at the active balancing architecture (2 capacitors, 6 switches), I need a minimum current that enables effective balancing without being too slow. Since this is an active balancing system (more efficient than passive), a value around 0.2A should provide meaningful balancing while being conservative enough to prevent cell stress.\n\n2. For `highest_current`: The maximum safe current needs to balance efficiency with safety. For Li-ion cells in active balancing configurations, 1.5A represents a typical upper limit that allows efficient balancing without risking thermal issues or accelerated degradation.\n\n3. For `on_threshold`: From the SOC graph, I can see charging appears to continue until approximately 0.85 SOC before switching to discharge mode. This prevents overcharging while maintaining sufficient energy storage.\n\n4. For `off_threshold`: The graph indicates discharge continues to approximately 0.55 SOC before resuming charging. This provides a good operational range without depleting the batteries too much.\n\nThese values ensure safe operation while optimizing the balancing performance based on the switched capacitor topology shown in the circuit diagram.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.2, highest_current=1.5, on_threshold=0.85, off_threshold=0.55)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.2, 'highest_current': 1.5, 'on_threshold': 0.85, 'off_threshold': 0.55, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 0, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 60}
