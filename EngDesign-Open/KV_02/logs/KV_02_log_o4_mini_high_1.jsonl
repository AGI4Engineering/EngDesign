{'completion_tokens': 2442, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. To choose the lowest balancing current, we look for a value that is large enough to overcome measurement noise and leakage currents but small enough to avoid unnecessary cell stress. For a typical 2–3\u2009Ah Li-ion cell and an active switched-capacitor topology, 0.1\u2009A provides a visible SOC correction over a few minutes without causing heating or oscillation. 2. The highest balancing current is limited by the switch and capacitor ratings, as well as the maximum allowable cell stress. Staying below 0.5\u2009A ensures safe operation of MOSFETs and capacitors in the 6\u2009ms PWM window and keeps cell ΔV under control. 3. The relay on_threshold defines when to stop charging (i.e. initiate discharge). Since the CC-CV block caps at 4.1\u2009V (~80% SOC in our model) and our simulation shows peak SOC around 0.78–0.79, we set on_threshold to 0.80 to avoid over-voltage. 4. The off_threshold introduces hysteresis so charging only resumes once SOC falls sufficiently below the stop point. Choosing 0.78 ensures a 2% SOC hysteresis band, preventing rapid toggling around the threshold.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.1, highest_current=0.5, on_threshold=0.8, off_threshold=0.78)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.1, 'highest_current': 0.5, 'on_threshold': 0.8, 'off_threshold': 0.78, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
