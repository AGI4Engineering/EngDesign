{'completion_tokens': 1477, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Step 1: Identify the key requirements. We need a lower and upper bound on the balancing current, and two SOC thresholds that form a hysteresis band for relay toggling (stop charging at the upper threshold, resume charging at the lower threshold). Step 2: Choose a practical balancing current range. Typical active capacitor‐based balancing currents run between a few tens and a few hundreds of milliamps to steadily shift charge without undue stress. We pick 50 mA (0.05 A) as the smallest current that still produces reasonable balancing speed, and 200 mA (0.20 A) as an upper limit below ≈0.1C for most 2 Ah–5 Ah Li-ion cells to avoid SOC instability. Step 3: Establish SOC thresholds. The highest initial cell SOC is 0.80. To start discharging (stop charging) when a cell leads, we set on_threshold = 0.80. To avoid rapid on/off cycling, we resume charging only when SOC falls below the next cell’s level by a margin of 0.05, so off_threshold = 0.75. These choices yield safe, efficient balancing with hysteresis to suppress chatter.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.05, highest_current=0.2, on_threshold=0.8, off_threshold=0.75)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.05, 'highest_current': 0.2, 'on_threshold': 0.8, 'off_threshold': 0.75, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
