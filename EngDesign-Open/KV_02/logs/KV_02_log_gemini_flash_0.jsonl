{"completion_tokens": 241, "response": "reasoning=\"Based on the problem description and the provided context of a switched capacitor battery balancing system for Li-ion cells, I've chosen the following values: \\n\\n`lowest_current`: 0.1A is a reasonable minimum current to facilitate balancing without being negligibly slow. Below this, balancing would take a very long time.\\n`highest_current`: 1.0A is chosen as the maximum current to prevent SOC instability. Higher currents could lead to significant voltage fluctuations, potentially damaging the batteries.\\n`on_threshold`: 0.95 represents the SOC at which the system should stop charging. This is selected to maximize battery life and prevent overcharging. \\n`off_threshold`: 0.85 specifies when charging should resume. This value allows the battery to discharge a bit and utilize the maximum capacity.\" config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.1, highest_current=1.0, on_threshold=0.95, off_threshold=0.85)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"lowest_current": 0.1, "highest_current": 1.0, "on_threshold": 0.95, "off_threshold": 0.85, "score_breakdown": {"lowest_current_valid": 20, "highest_current_safe": 0, "current_ordering_valid": 20, "threshold_range_valid": 20, "threshold_ordering_valid": 20}}, "score": 80}
