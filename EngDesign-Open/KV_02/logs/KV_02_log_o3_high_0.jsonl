Operating window for balancing current\n• The switched-capacitor path is only active for half of each 6 ms PWM cycle (50 % duty) and is further split by the 180° interleaving, so the effective conduction time per capacitor is ≈25 % of a period.  \n• Commercial Li-ion cells in the 2 Ah class tolerate continuous balancing currents up to ~1 C (≈2 A) without noticeable ageing, but currents above ~0.6 C tend to interact with the CC-CV regulator and create oscillations when only three cells are present.  \n• To guarantee observable balancing even in worst-case ESR (≈100 mΩ path), an instantaneous ΔV of 100 mV is enough to push 1 A. Anything below 0.05 A would make balancing times impractically long (>10 h for a 10 % spread).  \n⇒ Chosen range: 0.10 A (lowest) … 1.20 A (highest). 0.10 A still yields steady equalisation while 1.20 A stays <0.6 C and keeps the PI loop stable.\n\n2. Relay hysteresis thresholds\n• The highest cell starts at 0.80 SOC; at that point its OCV is ≈4.06 V (for a 4.2 V full-charge reference). A safety margin of 40 mV is needed to avoid crossing the 4.10 V hard limit during the brief current spikes created by the balancing network.  \n• Therefore charging should be suspended a little below the initial 0.80 SOC, chosen here as 0.79 SOC ("on_threshold").\n• To avoid relay chatter we add ≈6 % hysteresis. Re-enable charging when the same cell has relaxed to ≈0.73 SOC, which corresponds to ~3.95 V OCV. This is still comfortably above the lowest cell (0.70 SOC) so charging can resume without reversing current in the lowest cell.  \n⇒ on_threshold = 0.79, off_threshold = 0.73.\n\n3. Consistency check\n• With the pack under CC mode the PI controller will see an error and reduce pack current once any cell reaches 4.10 V. Because we stop charging already at 0.79 SOC, cell voltage will stay <4.08 V, leaving room for dynamic spikes.  \n• During discharge (balancing phase) the lowest cell never falls below 0.70 SOC, well above the knee (~0.10\xad\xad–0.15 SOC) where internal resistance rises sharply.  \n• The 0.06 SOC hysteresis keeps the relay switching period >3 s for the selected currents, eliminating any high-frequency wear.\n\nThe four numerical values thus ensure safe voltage headroom, reasonable equalisation time, and robust relay behaviour.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.1, highest_current=1.2, on_threshold=0.79, off_threshold=0.73)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.1, 'highest_current': 1.2, 'on_threshold': 0.79, 'off_threshold': 0.73, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
