Working in the 0.7-0.85 SOC window keeps us far from the voltage limits (3.4–4.1 V).\n2. Balancing current – For long-term health, a target below 0.5 C is preferred. 0.05 A (≈0.025 C for 2 Ah) is the practical lower limit that still produces measurable re-distribution in minutes rather than hours. 1 A (≈0.5 C) is a conservative upper limit that stays well inside typical manufacturers’ 1 C balancing/charge specs and avoids controller or thermal stress.\n3. Relay hysteresis – To avoid rapid on/off chatter we create a 4 % SOC gap. Charging is stopped once the average SOC climbs to 0.82 (before any cell risks hitting 4.1 V during the next PWM period). When the pack relaxes to 0.78 the relay re-enables charging.\n4. Result – These numbers give a safe, efficient window where the PI-controlled CC-CV stage can work without saturating, while the switched-capacitor network has enough current to equalise the 5 % initial imbalance in a few minutes.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.05, highest_current=1.0, on_threshold=0.82, off_threshold=0.78)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.05, 'highest_current': 1.0, 'on_threshold': 0.82, 'off_threshold': 0.78, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
