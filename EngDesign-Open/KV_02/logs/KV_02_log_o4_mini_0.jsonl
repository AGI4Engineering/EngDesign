We start from the observed SOC trajectories (Cell 1: 0.70→0.78; Cell 2: 0.75→0.82; Cell 3: 0.80→0.85 over 2 000 s of charging in the reference plot).  \n2. Assuming a nominal cell capacity of ~2.5 Ah, raising ~0.08 of SOC in 2 000 s corresponds to a charge current of roughly 0.35 A. Balancing currents must remain well below that to avoid interfering with the main CC-CV loop yet still produce measurable SOC change.  \n3. We therefore pick a smallest balancing current (lowest_current) of 0.05 A so that even the weakest cell sees charge redistribution, and a largest balancing current (highest_current) of 0.30 A as a safe upper bound (≈10% of main charge/discharge current).  \n4. For the relay hysteresis: we wish to stop pack charging when the highest cell nears 0.85 SOC (matching the peak in the charge curve) and only resume charging once the pack has discharged down to 0.50 SOC (the minimum SOC in the plotted discharge). This 0.85/0.50 window prevents rapid on/off jitter and keeps cells in a safe 50–85% SOC band.  \n5. These four parameters satisfy the JSON schema and give a safe, effective balancing strategy within the given architecture.', config=ConfigFile(lowest_current=0.05, highest_current=0.3, on_threshold=0.85, off_threshold=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'lowest_current': 0.05, 'highest_current': 0.3, 'on_threshold': 0.85, 'off_threshold': 0.5, 'score_breakdown': {'lowest_current_valid': 20, 'highest_current_safe': 0, 'current_ordering_valid': 20, 'threshold_range_valid': 20, 'threshold_ordering_valid': 20}}, 'score': 80}
