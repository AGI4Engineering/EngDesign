## Task Description
In this task, you will need to build a fuzzy inference system using MATLAB Fuzzy Logic Designer app for a tipping problem. For this problem, the tipping behavior is defined using the following rule:
1. If the service is poor or the food is rancid, then the tip is cheap.
2. If the service is good, then the tip is average.
3. If the service is excellent or the food is delicious, then the tip is generous.
The following MATLAB code is given to build the fuzzy inference system with some missing parts:
<code>
% create a Mamdani FIS, specifying its name
fis = mamfis("Name","tipper");
% add input variables
fis = addInput(fis,[0 10],"Name","service");
fis = addInput(fis,[0 10],"Name","food");
% add membership function 1
fis = addMF(fis,"service","<MISSING_type>",<MISSING_parameters>,"Name","poor");
% add membership function 2
fis = addMF(fis,"service","<MISSING_type>",<MISSING_parameters>,"Name","good");
% add membership function 3
fis = addMF(fis,"service","<MISSING_type>",<MISSING_parameters>,"Name","excellent");
% add membership function 4
fis = addMF(fis,"food","<MISSING_type>",<MISSING_parameters>,"Name","rancid");
% add membership function 5
fis = addMF(fis,"food","<MISSING_type>",<MISSING_parameters>,"Name","delicious");
% add output variable
fis = addOutput(fis,[0 30],"Name","tip");
% add membership function 6
fis = addMF(fis,"tip","<MISSING_type>",<MISSING_parameters>,"Name","cheap");
% add membership function 7
fis = addMF(fis,"tip","<MISSING_type>",<MISSING_parameters>,"Name","average");
% add membership function 8
fis = addMF(fis,"tip","<MISSING_type>",<MISSING_parameters>,"Name","generous");
% add rules
ruleList = <MISSING_rule_list>;
fis = addRule(fis,ruleList);
</code>

### Task 1
Your first task is to complete the code to build the fuzzy inference system. For membership functions, the corresponding shape is given in the attached image 1 to 8. You need to determine the type of membership function and the parameters using the images. You should choose membership function types among gaussmf, trapmf, and trimf.

### Task 2
Your second task is to specify the rule list for the fuzzy inference system as a numeric array using the aforementioned rules. 
Each row of the array contains one rule in the following format.
- Column 1 — Index of membership function for first input
- Column 2 — Index of membership function for second input
- Column 3 — Index of membership function for output
- Column 4 — Rule weight (from 0 to 1)
- Column 5 — Fuzzy operator (1 for AND, 2 for OR)
Therefore, you should return a 3x5 array for this rule list.

### Task 3
Your third task is to use the fuzzy inference system to determine the tip for the following inputs:
Input 1:
- service = 6
- food = 6
Input 2:
- service = 1
- food = 2
