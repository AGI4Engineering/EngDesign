MF1 (service-poor): From the image, this is a Gaussian function (gaussmf) centered at 0 with sigma=1.5 as indicated in the title\n2. MF2 (service-good): Another Gaussian function centered at 5 with sigma=1.5\n3. MF3 (service-excellent): Gaussian function centered at 10 with sigma=1.5\n4. MF4 (food-rancid): This is a trapezoidal function (trapmf) with points at [-2, 0, 1, 3]\n5. MF5 (food-delicious): Another trapezoidal function with points at [7, 9, 10, 12]\n6. MF6 (tip-cheap): A triangular function (trimf) with points at [0, 5, 10]\n7. MF7 (tip-average): A triangular function with points at [10, 15, 20]\n8. MF8 (tip-generous): A triangular function with points at [20, 25, 30]\n\nFor the rule list, I need to convert the three rules into a 3Ã—5 numeric array format:\n\nRule 1: If service is poor OR food is rancid, then tip is cheap.\n- This uses service (index 1) and food (index 1) with OR operator (2) to produce tip (index 1)\n- Row: [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nRule 2: If service is good, then tip is average.\n- This only uses service (index 2) to produce tip (index 2)\n- Row: [2, 0, 2, 1, 1] (0 means "don\'t care" for food input)\n\nRule 3: If service is excellent OR food is delicious, then tip is generous.\n- This uses service (index 3) and food (index 2) with OR operator (2) to produce tip (index 3)\n- Row: [3, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\nFor the tip calculation:\n- Input 1 (service=6, food=6): Service has high membership in "good" and some in "excellent", while food has minimal membership in both categories. The dominant rule will be Rule 2, producing a tip around 15.\n- Input 2 (service=1, food=2): Service has high membership in "poor" and food has some membership in "rancid".
