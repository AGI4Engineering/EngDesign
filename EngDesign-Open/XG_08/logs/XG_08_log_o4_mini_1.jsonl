{'completion_tokens': 5060, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To solve the three tasks, I proceeded step by step:\n\n1.  Examined each membership‐function (MF) plot and identified its type and parameters:\n   – Service has three Gaussian MFs (poor, good, excellent) all with σ=1.5 and centers at 0, 5, and 10 respectively.  In MATLAB’s mamfis, gaussmf takes [σ, c].\n   – Food has two trapezoidal MFs: rancid rises from –2 to 0, is flat between 0–1, and falls to 3 ➔ trapmf([-2,0,1,3]); delicious rises from 7 to 9, flat 9–10, falls to 12 ➔ trapmf([7,9,10,12]).\n   – Tip has three triangular MFs: cheap is tri([0,5,10]), average is tri([10,15,20]), generous is tri([20,25,30]).\n\n2.  Built the rule list as a 3×5 integer array.  Using MATLAB conventions:\n   – Rule 1: If service is poor OR food is rancid ⇒ tip is cheap ➔ [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n   – Rule 2: If service is good (food “don’t care”) ⇒ tip is average ➔ [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n   – Rule 3: If service is excellent OR food is delicious ⇒ tip is generous ➔ [3, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\n3.  Evaluated the FIS at (service,food)=(6,6) and (1,2):\n   – Computed each MF’s membership, fired rules with OR/AND, clipped the three output triangles, and used centroid defuzzification over [0 30].\n   – For (6,6), the “average” MF dominates (μ≈0.80) with minor “cheap” (≈0.0003) and “generous” (≈0.0286).  The final centroid ≈15.34.\n   – For (1,2), the “cheap” MF dominates (μ≈0.80) with small “average” (≈0.0286), giving centroid ≈5.35.\n\nBelow is the completed JSON config with all missing types, parameters, rule list, and the two computed tip values.', config=ConfigFile(MISSING_type1='gaussmf', MISSING_parameters1=[1.5, 0.0], MISSING_type2='gaussmf', MISSING_parameters2=[1.5, 5.0], MISSING_type3='gaussmf', MISSING_parameters3=[1.5, 10.0], MISSING_type4='trapmf', MISSING_parameters4=[-2.0, 0.0, 1.0, 3.0], MISSING_type5='trapmf', MISSING_parameters5=[7.0, 9.0, 10.0, 12.0], MISSING_type6='trimf', MISSING_parameters6=[0.0, 5.0, 10.0], MISSING_type7='trimf', MISSING_parameters7=[10.0, 15.0, 20.0], MISSING_type8='trimf', MISSING_parameters8=[20.0, 25.0, 30.0], MISSING_rule_list=[[1, 1, 1, 1, 2], [2, 0, 2, 1, 1], [3, 2, 3, 1, 2]], MISSING_tip1=15.343, MISSING_tip2=5.345)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'membership_function_score': 32, 'rule_list_score': 26, 'tip1_error': 'Tip for input 1 is not correct', 'tip2_error': 'Tip for input 2 is not correct'}, 'score': 58}
