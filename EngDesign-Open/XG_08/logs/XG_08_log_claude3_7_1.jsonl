If the service is poor or the food is rancid, then the tip is cheap.\n2. If the service is good, then the tip is average.\n3. If the service is excellent or the food is delicious, then the tip is generous.\n\nRule format: [service_MF_index, food_MF_index, tip_MF_index, weight, operator]\nWhere operator: 1 = AND, 2 = OR\n\nRule 1: If service is poor (MF1) OR food is rancid (MF4), then tip is cheap (MF6)\n[1, 4, 1, 1, 2]\n\nRule 2: If service is good (MF2), then tip is average (MF7)\n[2, 0, 2, 1, 1] (0 for food means "don\'t care")\n\nRule 3: If service is excellent (MF3) OR food is delicious (MF5), then tip is generous (MF8)\n[3, 5, 3, 1, 2]\n\n### Task 3: Calculate Tips for Given Inputs\n\nNow I\'ll estimate the expected tip values for the given inputs:\n\n**Input 1**: service = 6, food = 6\n\n- service = 6: This has moderate membership in "good" (MF2) and slight membership in "excellent" (MF3)\n- food = 6: This has low membership in both "rancid" (MF4) and "delicious" (MF5)\n\nRule 2 would fire most strongly (service is good -> tip is average)\nRule 3 might fire slightly (service has some membership in excellent OR food has very low membership in delicious -> tip is generous)\n\nThis would likely result in a tip around 15-18, weighted toward the "average" category.\n\n**Input 2**: service = 1, food = 2\n\n- service = 1: This has high membership in "poor" (MF1)\n- food = 2: This has moderate membership in "rancid" (MF4)\n\nRule 1 would fire strongly (service is poor OR food is rancid -> tip is cheap)\n\nThis would likely result in a tip around 5, within the "cheap" category.\n\nFor exact values, we\'d need to run the fuzzy inference system with these inputs.
