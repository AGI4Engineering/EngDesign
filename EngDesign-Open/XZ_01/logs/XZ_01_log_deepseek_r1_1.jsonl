The obstacles were mapped as blocked nodes, and the algorithm explored nodes while avoiding these regions. The path was constructed by moving around the vertical wall at x=10 by navigating north early, then east past x=30 after avoiding its lower blocked section. The horizontal wall at y=20 was circumvented by moving north to y=21. The cluster at (20,25)-(25,30) was avoided by routing south of it. Random obstacles were bypassed individually.
