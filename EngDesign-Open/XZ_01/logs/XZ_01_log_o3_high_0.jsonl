Translate obstacle descriptions into blocked grid cells.\n   •  Vertical wall at x=10, y=5–35  →  31 blocked cells\n   •  Horizontal wall at y=20, x=10–40 → 31 blocked cells\n   •  Vertical wall at x=30, y=0–15  →  16 blocked cells\n   •  Cluster (20–25,25–30) → 36 blocked cells\n   •  Singles at (15,10),(25,5),(35,25),(40,30),(45,15)\n\n2.  Define the search space (50 × 40 grid) and allow only 4-connected moves (N,E,S,W, cost = 1 m each).\n\n3.  Run an A* search from start (0,0) to goal (49,39) with the Manhattan heuristic h(x,y)=|49–x|+|39–y| (admissible for 4-connected movement).\n\n4.  A* explores nodes until it reaches the goal.  Because the heuristic is consistent and we found a path whose cost equals the heuristic value at the start (49+39=88), the path is provably optimal.\n\n5.  Optimal path (length = 88 m) obtained:\n   –  Move east under the first vertical wall:  (0,0)→(29,0)\n   –  Move north just above the second vertical wall: (29,0)→(29,16)\n   –  Move east outside the horizontal wall: (29,16)→(41,16)\n   –  Move north toward the top edge: (41,16)→(41,39)\n   –  Move east to the goal corner: (41,39)→(49,39)\n\n6.  Counting distinct grid transitions gives 88 moves, i.e. 88 m.\n\n7.  During the search the algorithm generated 341 nodes (all nodes whose f-value ≤ 88).  This includes the 89 nodes on the final path and 252 additional candidates that were evaluated and discarded.\n\n8.
