Since there are 4 digits, the total refresh frequency required is 4 * 60Hz = 240Hz.\n\n2. **Compute the division ratio needed from 50 MHz to achieve that:**\n   - The division ratio is the FPGA clock frequency divided by the total refresh frequency required.\n   - Division ratio = 50,000,000 Hz / 240 Hz = 208,333.33.\n   - Since the division ratio must be an integer, we round up to 208,334.\n\n3. **Determine the minimum number of counter bits `n` such that `2^n >= division_ratio`:**\n   - We need to find the smallest `n` such that `2^n >= 208,334`.\n   - `2^17 = 131,072` and `2^18 = 262,144`.\n   - Therefore, `n = 18`.\n\n4. **Select two appropriate counter bits to use for digit selection:**\n   - We need to select two bits that cycle through 4 values (00, 01, 10, 11).\n   - The two most significant bits of the counter can be used for this purpose.\n   - In the example, bits [16:15] are used for digit selection.\n\n5. **Justify your digit bit selection:**\n   - Using the two most significant bits of the counter ensures that they cycle through 4 values evenly as the counter increments.\n   - This is efficient and aligns with the example provided.\n\n6. **Calculate the maximum possible delay between refreshes of the same digit under worst-case conditions:**\n   - The nominal refresh period is 1/240Hz = 4.1667ms.\n   - Considering a clock tolerance of ±100 ppm, the worst-case clock frequency is 50,000,000 Hz * (1 ± 0.0001).\n   - Worst-case refresh period = 4.1667ms * (1 + 0.0001) = 4.1671ms.\n   - Adding a potential delay of up to 5 clock cycles (5 / 50,000,000 Hz = 0.0001ms), the maximum delay = 4.1671ms + 0.0001ms = 4.1672ms.\n\n7. **Determine if this maximum delay could cause perceptible flicker:**\n   - The maximum delay of 4.1672ms is much less than 33.33ms (30Hz threshold).\n   - Therefore, flicker is not possible.', config=ConfigFile(counter_bits=18, division_ratio=208334, digit_select_bits=[16, 15], bit_select_reasoning='Using the two most significant bits of the counter ensures that they cycle through 4 values evenly as the counter increments.
