{"completion_tokens": 826, "response": "reasoning='1. **Total Refresh Frequency:** Each of the 4 digits must refresh at 60Hz, so the total refresh frequency is 4 * 60Hz = 240Hz.\\n2. **Division Ratio:** The FPGA clock is 50MHz (50,000,000 Hz).  The required division ratio is 50,000,000 / 240 = 208333.33.  We round this up to 208334 to ensure we meet or exceed the refresh rate.\\n3. **Counter Bits:** We need to find the minimum number of counter bits `n` such that `2^n >= 208334`.  2^17 = 131072 (too small). 2^18 = 262144 (large enough). Therefore, we need 18 counter bits.\\n4. **Digit Select Bits:** We need two bits to cycle through the 4 digits. Bits [0] and [1] of the counter are a good choice. These bits increment regularly and provide all 4 combinations (00, 01, 10, 11).\\n5. **Justification:** Using the least significant bits ([0] and [1]) ensures a simple, repeating sequence for digit selection.  Each digit will be selected in turn.\\n6. **Max Delay:** \\n   - Clock period = 1 / 50,000,000 Hz = 20 ns.\\n   - With +/- 100ppm tolerance, the clock period can vary by +/- 20 ns * 0.0001 = +/- 0.002 ns.\\n   - Worst-case clock period = 20 ns + 0.002 ns = 20.002 ns.\\n   - Refresh period = 208334 clock cycles.\\n   - Ideal Refresh interval = 208334/50000000= 0.00416668 s = 4.167 ms\\n   - Worst case refresh interval = 208334 * (20.002E-9) s = 0.00416709668 s = 4.167 ms\\n    -Additional 5 clock cycle delay=5*(20.002E-9)=0.00000010001 s =0.0001ms\\n   - Total Worst Case delay between refreshes of the same digit = 4.167ms+0.0001ms=4.1671ms\\n7. **Flicker Check:** The flicker threshold is 30Hz, which corresponds to a maximum delay of 1/30 s = 33.33 ms.
