{'completion_tokens': 464, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Total refresh frequency required: Each digit must refresh at least 60Hz, and there are 4 digits. So total refresh frequency = 60Hz * 4 = 240Hz.\n2. Division ratio from 50MHz: 50,000,000Hz / 240Hz ≈ 208333.\n3. Minimum counter bits: 2^18 = 262144 > 208333, so n=18.\n4. Digit select bits: We need 2 bits to cycle through 4 digits (00, 01, 10, 11). From an 18-bit counter, we can use bits [17:16] (the two most significant bits) as they change at the required rate.\n5. Bit select reasoning: The two most significant bits of the counter naturally divide the counting space into 4 equal segments, making them ideal for digit selection.\n6. Max delay calculation: Base refresh period = 1/240Hz ≈ 4.167ms. With ±100ppm clock tolerance, worst-case period = 4.167ms * 1.0001 ≈ 4.1674ms. Adding 5 clock cycles delay at 50MHz = 5 * 20ns = 100ns ≈ 0.0001ms. Total max delay = 4.1674ms + 0.0001ms ≈ 4.1675ms.\n7.
