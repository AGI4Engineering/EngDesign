{'completion_tokens': 385, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design the 4-digit hexadecimal display driver with a refresh rate of at least 60Hz per digit, we need to calculate the total refresh frequency as 4 digits * 60Hz = 240Hz. The division ratio from the 50MHz FPGA clock is 50,000,000 / 240 ≈ 208333. The minimum number of counter bits n is determined by finding the smallest n where 2^n ≥ 208333, which is 18 (2^18 = 262144). For digit selection, we use bits 17 and 16 from the counter (counter[17:16]) as they cycle through 4 values (00, 01, 10, 11) at the required 240Hz rate. The maximum delay between refreshes considers the worst-case clock tolerance (±100ppm) and logic delay (5 cycles), resulting in a delay of approximately 4.17ms * (1 + 0.0001) + (5/50,000,000) ≈ 4.1705ms.
