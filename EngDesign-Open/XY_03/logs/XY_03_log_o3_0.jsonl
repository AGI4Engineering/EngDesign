{'completion_tokens': 6755, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Step-1  (required total refresh rate)\nEach of the 4 digits has to be refreshed ≥ 60 Hz.  With time-division multiplexing the refresh of one digit happens once every global scan cycle, therefore the scan (global) refresh rate must be 4 × 60 Hz = 240 Hz.\n\nStep-2  (division ratio from 50 MHz)\nDivision ratio  = 50 000 000 Hz / 240 Hz = 208 333.333…  (≈2.0833 × 10⁵)\n\nStep-3  (minimum power-of-two divider)\n2¹⁷ = 131 072  < 208 333\n2¹⁸ = 262 144  ≥ 208 333   →  n = 18 counter bits give the first power of two that does not undershoot.\n\nStep-4  (picking two bits for the 4-way digit select)\nA binary counter naturally contains every power-of-two division.  If we take the pair (bit17, bit16) (zero-based numbering) we obtain the pattern 00→01→10→11, i.e. four distinct values that can directly drive the four digits.\n\nStep-5  (why those bits)\nBits 17:16 correspond to a total divide-by 2¹⁸ (because the two-bit vector repeats after 2² extra counts).  This gives a global scan frequency of\nf_scan = 50 MHz / 2¹⁸ ≈ 190.7 Hz.\nAlthough this is lower than the ideal 240 Hz it is still >>> 60 Hz per digit, satisfying the flicker specification while using the smallest possible counter.\n\nStep-6  (worst-case delay between two activations of the same digit)\nNominal scan period  T_nom = 2¹⁸ / 50 000 000 Hz = 5.24288 ms.\nClock tolerance –100 ppm means frequency can be 0.01 % slower, therefore\nT_tol = T_nom × (1 + 1 × 10⁻⁴) = 5.243404 ms.\nUp to 5 extra clock cycles of latency (5 × 20 ns = 100 ns) add\nT_add = 0.000100 ms.\nMaximum delay  T_max = 5.243404 ms + 0.000100 ms ≈ 5.243504 ms.\n\nStep-7  (flicker check)\nThe critical flicker threshold is 30 Hz (period 33.33 ms).  The worst-case 5.24 ms << 33.33 ms, therefore no perceptible flicker is expected.\n\nA mitigation strategy, should additional margin ever be required, is simply to use the next faster pair of counter bits (bits 16:15) which would raise the scan rate to ≈381 Hz.', config=ConfigFile(counter_bits=18, division_ratio=208333, digit_select_bits=[17, 16], bit_select_reasoning='Bits 17 and 16 form the lowest two bits that appear after the divide-by-2¹⁸ stage, automatically cycling through 00,01,10,11.
