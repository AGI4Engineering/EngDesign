Computing the total refresh frequency required\nFor a 4-digit display where each digit must refresh at least 60Hz to avoid flickering:\n- Individual digit refresh rate: 60Hz (minimum)  \n- Total refresh frequency = 60Hz × 4 digits = 240Hz\n\nThis means we need to complete a full cycle of all 4 digits at least 240 times per second.\n\n### 2. Computing the division ratio from 50MHz\nDivision ratio = FPGA clock frequency / Required refresh frequency\nDivision ratio = 50,000,000Hz / 240Hz = 208,333.33...\n\nSince we need a whole number for the division ratio, we round down to ensure we meet or exceed the minimum refresh rate: **208,333**\n\n### 3. Determining minimum counter bits\nWe need to find n such that 2^n ≥ 208,333\n\n2^17 = 131,072 (too small)\n2^18 = 262,144 (sufficient)\n\nTherefore, we need at least 18 counter bits.\n\n### 4. Selecting two counter bits for digit selection\nWe need to select two bits that will cycle through 4 values (00, 01, 10, 11) for our 4 digits.\n\nThose should be consecutive bits that change frequently enough. Looking at a binary counter, the appropriate bits would be the ones that change at the right frequency to provide our desired multiplexing rate.\n\nBased on our division ratio of 208,333, we would divide the 50MHz clock:\n- Bit 0 toggles every 1 clock cycle\n- Bit 1 toggles every 2 clock cycles\n- Bit 2 toggles every 4 clock cycles\n...\n- Bit 16 toggles every 65,536 clock cycles\n- Bit 17 toggles every 131,072 clock cycles\n\nSince we want to cycle through all 4 digits within the 208,333 clock cycles, we should use bits 16 and 17 for digit selection.\n\n### 5. Justifying digit bit selection\nThe two most significant bits of our 18-bit counter (bits 16 and 17) are ideal for digit selection because:\n1. Using these bits ensures we complete a full cycle of all 4 digits within our division ratio timeframe\n2. These higher-order bits change less frequently, providing stable timing for each digit\n3. Using bits 16 and 17 means each digit is displayed for approximately 52,083 clock cycles (208,333/4), which gives adequate time for the display to settle\n4. This approach matches the example code where counter[16:15] is used for digit selection\n\n### 6. Calculating maximum possible delay\nThe maximum delay between refreshes of the same digit depends on several factors:\n\nBase period for one digit = Division ratio / 4 = 208,333 / 4 = 52,083.25 clock cycles\n\nFactors affecting the maximum delay:\n1. Clock tolerance: ±100 ppm = ±0.01%\n   - Worst case: clock runs 0.01% slower, extending period by a factor of 1.0001\n2. Display driver logic delay: up to 5 clock cycles\n\nMaximum period calculation:\n- Base period with tolerance: 52,083.25 × 1.0001 = 52,088.46 clock cycles\n- Add display driver delay: 52,088.46 + 5 = 52,093.46 clock cycles\n- Time for full 4-digit cycle: 52,093.46 × 4 = 208,373.84 clock cycles\n\nConvert to time in milliseconds:\n- At 50MHz, each clock cycle is 20ns (1/50,000,000 seconds)\n- Maximum delay = 52,093.46 × 20ns = 1,041,869.2ns = 1.042ms\n\n### 7. Determining flicker possibility\nFor flicker to be perceptible, the refresh rate would need to drop below 30Hz (period exceeding 33.33ms).\n\nOur calculated maximum delay is 1.042ms, which is well below the 33.33ms threshold.\nTherefore, flicker is not possible under these conditions.\n\n### Mitigation strategy\nAlthough flicker is not a concern with our current design, a mitigation strategy could be to use a slightly faster refresh rate by reducing the division ratio, which would ensure that even with worst-case timing delays, the refresh rate remains comfortably above the flicker threshold.", config=ConfigFile(counter_bits=18, division_ratio=208333, digit_select_bits=[16, 17], bit_select_reasoning='Bits 16 and 17 are the most appropriate for digit selection because they provide a complete cycle through all 4 digits within the calculated division ratio timeframe.
