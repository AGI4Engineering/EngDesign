{'completion_tokens': 7861, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Step-1:  The requirement is ≥60 Hz per digit.  Because 4 digits are refreshed sequentially, the multiplex (total) refresh frequency must therefore be 4 × 60 Hz = 240 Hz.\n\nStep-2:  With a 50 MHz system clock the division ratio that would give exactly 240 Hz is 50 000 000 / 240 ≈ 208 333.33.\n\nStep-3:  Hardware counters divide by powers of two, so we look for the smallest n with 2ⁿ ≥ 208 333.   2¹⁷ = 131 072 (< 208 333) and 2¹⁸ = 262 144 (≥ 208 333).  Thus n = 18 counter bits are required.\n\nStep-4:  In an 18-bit free-running counter the pair of bits [17:16] forms a two-bit field that naturally cycles through 00→01→10→11.  Each value therefore selects one of the four digits.\n\nStep-5:  Reason for choosing [17:16]:\n        • They give a per-digit dwell time of 2¹⁶ clock cycles (65 536 cycles).\n        • Dwell time = 65 536 / 50 000 000 = 1.310 72 ms → digit-switch (grid) frequency = 763 Hz.\n        • A full 4-digit frame lasts 4 × 1.310 72 ms = 5.242 88 ms → per-digit refresh rate ≈ 190.7 Hz (>60 Hz) with plenty of margin, while keeping duty-cycle reasonably high for brightness.\n\nStep-6:  Worst-case delay between two activations of the same digit:\n        Nominal frame period  T_frame = 2¹⁸ / 50 MHz = 262 144 / 50 000 000 = 0.00524288 s = 5.24288 ms.\n        Add +100 ppm slow clock:  T_frame × (1 + 0.0001) = 5.24288 ms × 1.0001 = 5.24340 ms.\n        Add up to 5 extra logic cycles: 5 × 20 ns = 100 ns = 0.00010 ms.\n        Maximum delay ≈ 5.24340 ms + 0.00010 ms = 5.24350 ms.\n\nStep-7:  Flicker check:  5.24 ms ≈ 190 Hz is far below the 33.3 ms (30 Hz) flicker threshold, so perceptible flicker is not expected.\n\nMitigation (if ever needed): use lower-order bits (e.g. [16:15]) to double the refresh rate or employ PWM, but current design already meets the visual requirement.', config=ConfigFile(counter_bits=18, division_ratio=208333, digit_select_bits=[17, 16], bit_select_reasoning='Using the two MSBs [17:16] of the 18-bit counter automatically generates the 4-state sequence 00-01-10-11 with no extra logic.
