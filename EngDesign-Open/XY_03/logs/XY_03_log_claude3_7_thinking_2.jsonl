Computing the total refresh frequency required:\n   - Each digit needs to refresh at minimum 60Hz to avoid flickering\n   - With 4 digits using time-division multiplexing, total refresh frequency = 4 × 60Hz = 240Hz\n\n2. Computing the division ratio:\n   - Division ratio = FPGA clock frequency / total refresh frequency\n   - Division ratio = 50MHz / 240Hz = 208,333.33...\n   - Since we need an integer value, I'll use 208,334 (rounded up to ensure we meet minimum refresh rate)\n\n3. Determining minimum counter bits:\n   - We need the smallest n where 2^n ≥ 208,334\n   - 2^17 = 131,072 (too small)\n   - 2^18 = 262,144 (greater than 208,334)\n   - Therefore, we need a minimum of 18 counter bits\n\n4. Selecting appropriate counter bits for digit selection:\n   - We need 2 bits that can cycle through 4 values (for our 4 digits)\n   - Bits 16 and 17 are appropriate since they divide the counter range into 4 parts\n   - These will cycle through the patterns 00, 01, 10, and 11 regularly\n\n5. Justifying bit selection:\n   - Bits 16 and 17 are the most significant changing bits within our counter range\n   - Bit 16 changes every 2^16 = 65,536 clock cycles\n   - Bit 17 changes every 2^17 = 131,072 clock cycles\n   - Together they ensure all 4 digits get relatively equal display time in the multiplexing scheme\n\n6. Calculating maximum delay between refreshes:\n   - Ideal refresh period for a digit = 1/60Hz = 16.667ms\n   - With clock tolerance of -100ppm, clock could be as slow as 49.995MHz\n   - This makes the refresh period: 16.667ms × (50MHz/49.995MHz) = 16.669ms\n   - Additional delay from display driver logic: 5 clock cycles = 5/49.995MHz = 0.0001ms\n   - Maximum possible delay = 16.669ms + 0.0001ms = 16.67ms\n\n7. Determining flicker possibility:\n   - Flicker threshold is 30Hz (period of 33.33ms)\n   - Our maximum delay is 16.67ms, which is less than 33.33ms\n   - Therefore, perceptible flicker is not possible", config=ConfigFile(counter_bits=18, division_ratio=208334, digit_select_bits=[16, 17], bit_select_reasoning='Bits 16 and 17 are the most significant bits for the counter range up to 208,334 and provide a natural division of the counter range into 4 parts for digit selection.', max_delay_ms=16.67, is_flicker_possible=False, mitigation_strategy='No mitigation is necessary as the refresh rate is well above the flicker threshold.')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'counter_bits': '18 bits is within acceptable engineering range (17-19)', 'division_ratio': '208334 is within ±1000 of 208333', 'digit_select_bits': '[16, 17] are valid consecutive high-order bits', 'max_delay': 'Maximum delay calculation of 16.67ms is incorrect', 'flicker_assessment': 'Incorrect assessment of flicker possibility'}, 'score': 80}
