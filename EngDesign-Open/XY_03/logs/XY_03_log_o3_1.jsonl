{'completion_tokens': 5338, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Step-1  Required overall refresh frequency\nEach of the four digits must be refreshed ≥60 Hz.  With time-division multiplexing one global scan of the four digits produces one refresh of every digit, therefore\nf_refresh(min) = 4 · 60 Hz = 240 Hz.\n\nStep-2  Division ratio from 50 MHz\nD_required = f_clk / f_refresh = 50 000 000 Hz / 240 Hz = 208 333.33.  A divider that is equal to or smaller than this number will yield ≥60 Hz per digit.\n\nStep-3  Minimum power-of-two divider\nWe normally build the divider with a binary counter, so we find the smallest n with 2^n ≥ 208 333 ⇒ 2^17 = 131 072 (too small) and 2^18 = 262 144 (big enough).  Hence n = 18 counter bits gives the first power of two not less than the calculated ratio.\n\nStep-4  Choosing two bits for digit-select lines\nThe counter bits (17 downto 0) toggle as\nbit i period = 2^(i+1)/f_clk seconds.\nUsing bits [17:16] yields a 2-bit vector that naturally cycles through 00,01,10,11 (4 states).  The time that any one digit is active is the period of bit 16 :\nT_digit = 2^16 / f_clk = 65 536 / 50 000 000 ≈ 1.310 72 ms → f_digit ≈ 763 Hz (> 60 Hz).\n\nStep-5  Why bits 17 and 16?\n• They form the MSBs of the counter, so no extra logic is required – just wire them out.\n• They guarantee a balanced 25 % duty-cycle for every digit.\n• The resulting 763 Hz refresh per digit is far above the 60 Hz threshold yet still slow enough to give each digit >1 ms on-time, which is helpful for LED brightness.\n\nStep-6  Worst-case delay between two activations of the same digit\nNominal period per digit               : T_nom = 1.310 720 ms\n50 MHz clock –100 ppm  (slowest clock) : T_clk = T_nom · 1.0001 ≈ 1.310 851 ms\nAdditional 5 clock-cycle latency       : 5 / 49 995 000 Hz ≈ 0.000 100 ms\nT_max = 1.310 851 ms + 0.000 100 ms ≈ 1.310 951 ms ≈ 1.311 ms\n\nStep-7  Flicker evaluation\nThe flicker-visibility threshold is 33.33 ms (30 Hz).  The worst-case delay (≈1.31 ms) is over 25× shorter, therefore perceptible flicker is not possible.\n\nMitigation strategy (if ever needed): choose lower-order bits (e.g. 15:14) or use a PWM dimmer to raise the refresh rate even further.', config=ConfigFile(counter_bits=18, division_ratio=208333, digit_select_bits=[17, 16], bit_select_reasoning='Bits 17 and 16 are the two most significant bits of an 18-bit free-running counter.
