{'completion_tokens': 18400, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design the display driver, I need to determine how fast we need to refresh all digits and specify the counter design.\n\n1. Total refresh frequency required:\n   - Each digit must refresh at 60Hz minimum\n   - With 4 digits total, we need a combined refresh frequency of 4 × 60Hz = 240Hz\n\n2. Division ratio calculation:\n   - To convert 50MHz clock to 240Hz: 50,000,000 ÷ 240 = 208,333.33\n   - This is our division ratio\n\n3. Counter bits required:\n   - Need minimum n where 2^n ≥ 208,333.33\n   - 2^17 = 131,072 (too small)\n   - 2^18 = 262,144 (sufficient)\n   - Therefore, we need 18 counter bits\n\n4. Selecting digit selection bits:\n   - Need two bits that cycle through 4 values (00,01,10,11)\n   - Using bits 16 and 15 would give refresh rate = 50MHz/2^17 = 381.47Hz\n   - This provides 95.37Hz per digit (above 60Hz requirement)\n\n5. Maximum delay calculation:\n   - Nominal refresh period: 1/(381.47Hz) = 2.62ms\n   - With clock tolerance: 2.62ms × (1 + 100ppm) = 2.62ms × 1.0001 = 2.6203ms\n   - Adding 5 clock cycle delay: 5/(50MHz) = 0.1μs\n   - Total maximum delay: 2.6203ms + 0.1μs = 2.62ms\n\n6.
