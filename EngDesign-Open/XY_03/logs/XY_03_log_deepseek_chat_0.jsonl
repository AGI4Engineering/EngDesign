{'completion_tokens': 506, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Total refresh frequency required: Each digit must refresh at least 60Hz, and there are 4 digits. So total refresh frequency = 60Hz * 4 = 240Hz.\n2. Division ratio from 50 MHz: 50,000,000 Hz / 240 Hz ≈ 208333.\n3. Minimum number of counter bits: 2^18 = 262144 ≥ 208333, so n=18.\n4. Digit select bits: We need to cycle through 4 values (00, 01, 10, 11), so we can use bits [17:16] from the counter (since we have 18 bits total).\n5. Bit select reasoning: Bits [17:16] are chosen because they change at 1/4 the rate of the total refresh frequency (240Hz/4=60Hz), ensuring each digit gets refreshed at the required 60Hz.\n6. Max delay calculation: \n   - Base refresh period = 1/240Hz ≈ 4.1667ms\n   - Clock tolerance effect: ±100ppm means ±0.01% variation, so max period = 4.1667ms * 1.0001 ≈ 4.1671ms\n   - Logic delay: 5 cycles at 50MHz = 100ns\n   - Total max delay for one digit cycle (4 refreshes) = 4 * 4.1671ms + 100ns ≈ 16.6684ms + 0.0001ms ≈ 16.6685ms\n7.
