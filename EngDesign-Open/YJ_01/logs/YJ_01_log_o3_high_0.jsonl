Channel-1 tells us the admissible material fraction is 0.48 everywhere, therefore the optimized topology must end up with ≈ 48 % solid cells.  \n3. Compliance is the work done by the external forces, equal to twice the total strain energy in the converged topology (C = 2 · Σ U_e).  \n4. From Channel-3 (strain-energy) we estimate the mean element energy to be ≈ 0.03; multiplying by the number of elements (4096) gives ≈ 0.03 × 4096 ≈ 123.  \n5. Hence the overall compliance is C ≈ 2 × 123 ≈ 246.  \n6.
