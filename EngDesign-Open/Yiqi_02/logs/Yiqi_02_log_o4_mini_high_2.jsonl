{'completion_tokens': 9712, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='We need to partition a MatMul C[32,15360] += A[32,5120] * B[5120,15360] across up to 1472 IPU cores, each with 624 KB SRAM and a 16×16 systolic array. We want to: 1) use as many cores as possible to minimize per‐core compute; 2) keep each per‐core sub‐tensor small enough to fit scratchpad; 3) avoid inter‐core communication by using no temporal rotations (f_t=1), thus trading memory replication for zero communication overhead;\n\n1) Let F_op = [f_m,f_k,f_n] with P = f_m·f_k·f_n ≤ 1472 and choose P=1472 for maximum parallelism (minimize per‐core MACs). Since m=32 is small, set f_m=1. Then f_k·f_n=1472. 1472 factors as 23·64.  \n\n2) Take f_k=23, f_n=64.  \n   • Each core’s A‐block is 32×ceil(5120/23)=32×224 (224=16×14 after 16‐wide pad).   \n   • Each core’s B‐block is 224×240 (240=15360/64).  \n   • Each core’s C‐block is 32×240.  \nMemory per core = 32×224×2 + 224×240×2 + 32×240×2 = 8 kB + 107.52 kB + 15.36 kB ≈ 131 kB ≪ 624 kB.  \nAll block dims are multiples of 16 (after pad), so they map perfectly to the 16×16 array.  \n\n3) We set all temporal factors f_t_* = 1 to avoid any inter‐core rotation. This fully replicates each spatial block across the cores that need it, but since our memory budget per core is small, that is acceptable.  \n\n4) This plan uses exactly 1472 cores, zero communication, and a per‐core workload of about 32×224×240 ≈ 1.72 M MACs, which is minimal per core and balanced.  \n\nConfig choices satisfy T10 constraints:  \n– ∏f_t for each tensor divides its replication factor (all f_t=1)  \n– f_t on shared dims are aligned (all 1)', config=ConfigFile(F_op=[1, 23, 64], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=1, f_t_B_k=1, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [1, 23, 64], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 1, 'f_t_B_k': 1, 'f_t_B_n': 1, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 1, 'score': np.float64(83.45401156482832), 't10_time': 7018, 'ai_time': np.float64(13380.0), 'passed': np.True_}, 'score': 83.45401156482832}
