This eliminates communication overhead for tensor rotation while still meeting memory constraints.\n\nOther options like F_op = [2, 20, 30] would provide better alignment with the systolic array (perfect 512-sized blocks for dimension n), but would use only 1,200 cores, resulting in approximately 23% more computation per core. The small padding overhead (less than 1%) with F_op = [2, 32, 23] is preferable to the larger performance impact of using fewer cores.\n\nStep 5: Final plan\nThe optimal execution plan uses all 1,472 cores with minimal communication overhead:\n- F_op = [2, 32, 23]\n- All temporal partition factors set to 1", config=ConfigFile(F_op=[2, 32, 23], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=1, f_t_B_k=1, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [2, 32, 23], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 1, 'f_t_B_k': 1, 'f_t_B_n': 1, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 1, 'score': np.float64(83.42157108881364), 't10_time': 7018, 'ai_time': np.float64(13400.0), 'passed': np.True_}, 'score': 83.42157108881364}
