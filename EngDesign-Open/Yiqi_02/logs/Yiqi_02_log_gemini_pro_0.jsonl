The plan involves specifying operator partition factors ($F_{op}$) and temporal partition factors ($f_t$) for tensors A, B, and C.\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Problem Parameters & Constraints**:\\\\n    *   Dimensions: $M=32, K=5120, N=15360$.\\\\n    *   Data type: FP16 (2 bytes/element).\\\\n    *   Hardware: Up to 1472 cores, 624KB SRAM per core ($638976$ bytes).\\\\n    *   Systolic array: $16 \\\\\\\\times 16$. Sub-MatMul dimensions on each core ($m'_{sub}, n'_{sub}$) must be multiples of 16.\\\\n    *   Goal: Minimize execution time, satisfy memory/core constraints, and T10 rules.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **T10 Definitions and Key Constraints**:\\\\n    *   $F_{op} = [F_{op_m}, F_{op_k}, F_{op_n}]$: Operator partition factors. Total cores = $F_{op_m} \\\\\\\\cdot F_{op_k} \\\\\\\\cdot F_{op_n}$.\\\\n    *   $f_s^X$: Spatial partition factor for tensor X, derived from $F_{op}$.\\\\n        *   $f_s^A = [F_{op_m}, F_{op_k}]$, $f_s^B = [F_{op_k}, F_{op_n}]$, $f_s^C = [F_{op_m}, F_{op_n}]$.\\\\n    *   $P_X$: Number of cores sharing a sub-tensor of X. $P_A = F_{op_n}$, $P_B = F_{op_m}$, $P_C = F_{op_k}$ (assuming $F_{op}$ axes align with tensor axes as described for MatMul).\\\\n    *   $f_t^X = [f_{t_X_dim1}, f_{t_X_dim2}]$: Temporal partition factors for tensor X.\\\\n    *   Constraint 1: $\\\\\\\\prod f_t^X$ must divide $P_X$.\\\\n    *   Constraint 2 (Alignment): For tensors sharing a common dimension, their $f_t$ values on that dimension must be factors/multiples of each other.\\\\n        *   Dimension $m$: $f_{t_A_m}$ vs $f_{t_C_m}$.\\\\n        *   Dimension $k$: $f_{t_A_k}$ vs $f_{t_B_k}$.\\\\n        *   Dimension $n$: $f_{t_B_n}$ vs $f_{t_C_n}$.\\\\n\\\\n3.  **Strategy for Deriving Partition Factors**:\\\\n    a.  **Set $F_{op_k}=1$**: This simplifies the problem by avoiding spatial partitioning of the reduction dimension $k$. This typically reduces communication for accumulating partial sums of C.\\\\n        *   With $F_{op_k}=1$, $P_C = F_{op_k} = 1$.\\\\n        *   Constraint 1 for C: $f_{t_C_m} \\\\\\\\cdot f_{t_C_n}$ must divide $P_C=1$. This implies $f_{t_C_m}=1$ and $f_{t_C_n}=1$.\\\\n    b.  **Apply Alignment Constraints**:\\\\n        *   Dim $m$: $f_{t_A_m}$ aligns with $f_{t_C_m}=1 \\\\\\\\implies f_{t_A_m}=1$.\\\\n        *   Dim $n$: $f_{t_B_n}$ aligns with $f_{t_C_n}=1 \\\\\\\\implies f_{t_B_n}=1$.\\\\n    c.  The problem reduces to finding $F_{op_m}, F_{op_n}, f_{t_A_k}, f_{t_B_k}$.\\\\n\\\\n4.  **Determine $F_{op_m}$ and $F_{op_n}$**:\\\\n    *   Total cores $F_{op_m} \\\\\\\\cdot F_{op_n} \\\\\\\\le 1472$.\\\\n    *   Per-core sub-operator dimensions: $m_{sub} = \\\\\\\\lceil M/F_{op_m} \\\\\\\\rceil$, $k_{sub} = \\\\\\\\lceil K/F_{op_k} \\\\\\\\rceil$, $n_{sub} = \\\\\\\\lceil N/F_{op_n} \\\\\\\\rceil$.\\\\n    *   Padded dimensions: $m'_{sub} = \\\\\\\\text{ceil_to_multiple}(m_{sub}, 16)$, $n'_{sub} = \\\\\\\\text{ceil_to_multiple}(n_{sub}, 16)$, $k'_{sub} = k_{sub}$.\\\\n    *   For $M=32$: To minimize padding on $m$, $F_{op_m}$ should be 1 or 2.\\\\n        *   If $F_{op_m}=1 \\\\\\\\implies m_{sub}=32, m'_{sub}=32$.\\\\n        *   If $F_{op_m}=2 \\\\\\\\implies m_{sub}=16, m'_{sub}=16$.\\\\n    *   Let's choose $F_{op_m}=2$. Then $m'_{sub}=16$. Number of cores $2 \\\\\\\\cdot F_{op_n} \\\\\\\\le 1472 \\\\\\\\implies F_{op_n} \\\\\\\\le 736$.\\\\n    *   For $N=15360$: We need $F_{op_n}$ that is a divisor of 15360 and minimizes padding for $n_{sub} = \\\\\\\\lceil 15360/F_{op_n} \\\\\\\\rceil$.\\\\n        *   Try $F_{op_n}=512$. $n_{sub} = \\\\\\\\lceil 15360/512 \\\\\\\\rceil = 30$. So $n'_{sub} = \\\\\\\\text{ceil_to_multiple}(30, 16) = 32$. Padding is $(32-30)/30 \\\\\\\\approx 6.7\\\\%$, which is acceptable.\\\\n    *   Chosen $F_{op} = [2, 1, 512]$. Total cores = $2 \\\\\\\\cdot 1 \\\\\\\\cdot 512 = 1024$ cores ( $\\\\\\\\le 1472$).\\\\n\\\\n5.  **Determine $f_{t_A_k}$ and $f_{t_B_k}$**:\\\\n    *   With $F_{op}=[2,1,512]$ and derived $f_t$ values: $f_{t_A_m}=1, f_{t_B_n}=1, f_{t_C_m}=1, f_{t_C_n}=1$.\\\\n    *   Constraint 1 for A: $f_{t_A_m} \\\\\\\\cdot f_{t_A_k} = 1 \\\\\\\\cdot f_{t_A_k}$ must divide $P_A=F_{op_n}=512$. So $f_{t_A_k}$ divides 512.\\\\n    *   Constraint 1 for B: $f_{t_B_k} \\\\\\\\cdot f_{t_B_n} = f_{t_B_k} \\\\\\\\cdot 1$ must divide $P_B=F_{op_m}=2$. So $f_{t_B_k} \\\\\\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\}$.\\\\n    *   Alignment for $k$: $f_{t_A_k}$ and $f_{t_B_k}$ must be factor/multiple of each other.\\\\n    *   Memory per core: $Mem_A + Mem_B + Mem_C \\\\\\\\le 638976$ bytes.\\\\n        $m'_{sub}=16, k'_{sub}=K/F_{op_k} = 5120/1 = 5120, n'_{sub}=32$.\\\\n        $Mem_A = (m'_{sub}/f_{t_A_m}) \\\\\\\\cdot (k'_{sub}/f_{t_A_k}) \\\\\\\\cdot 2 = (16/1) \\\\\\\\cdot (5120/f_{t_A_k}) \\\\\\\\cdot 2 = 163840 / f_{t_A_k}$ bytes.\\\\n        $Mem_B = (k'_{sub}/f_{t_B_k}) \\\\\\\\cdot (n'_{sub}/f_{t_B_n}) \\\\\\\\cdot 2 = (5120/f_{t_B_k}) \\\\\\\\cdot (32/1) \\\\\\\\cdot 2 = 327680 / f_{t_B_k}$ bytes.\\\\n        $Mem_C = (m'_{sub}/f_{t_C_m}) \\\\\\\\cdot (n'_{sub}/f_{t_C_n}) \\\\\\\\cdot 2 = (16/1) \\\\\\\\cdot (32/1) \\\\\\\\cdot 2 = 1024$ bytes.\\\\n    *   To minimize communication (i.e., number of temporal steps, $lcm(f_{t_A_k}, f_{t_B_k})$), we aim for small $f_t$ values if memory allows.\\\\n    *   Try $f_{t_A_k}=1, f_{t_B_k}=1$. $lcm(1,1)=1$ temporal step.\\\\n        *   Check constraints: $f_{t_A_k}=1$ divides 512. $f_{t_B_k}=1$ divides 2. $f_{t_A_k}=1, f_{t_B_k}=1$ are aligned. All valid.\\\\n        *   Memory: $Mem_A = 163840/1 = 163840$. $Mem_B = 327680/1 = 327680$. $Mem_C=1024$.\\\\n        *   Total Memory = $163840 + 327680 + 1024 = 492544$ bytes ($481$ KB).\\\\n        *   $481 \\\\\\\\text{ KB} \\\\\\\\le 624 \\\\\\\\text{ KB}$.
