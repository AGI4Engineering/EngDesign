The IPU has 1472 cores and each core has 624KB of scratchpad memory. The tensors are in FP16 format (2 bytes). The execution plan should minimize total execution time while ensuring that sub-tensor partitions do not overflow the per-core SRAM size and complies with T10's constraints, using no more than 1,472 cores.\\n\\nGiven the constraints and dimensions, we need to find suitable partition factors. The product of the F_op elements must be less than or equal to 1472. Also memory constraint on each core must be satisfied.\\n\\nA possible, and relatively simple execution plan is to assign each of the 1472 cores a small part of the computation. Specifically the following parameters satisfy the constratints:\\n\\n- F_op = [32, 1, 46] which uses 32 * 46 = 1472 cores.\\n- f_t_A_m = 1, no temporal partition of A along m\\n- f_t_A_k = 1, no temporal partition of A along k\\n- f_t_B_k = 1, no temporal partition of B along k\\n- f_t_B_n = 1, no temporal partition of B along n\\n- f_t_C_m = 1, no temporal partition of C along m\\n- f_t_C_n = 1, no temporal partition of C along n\\n\\nIn this case the submatrix size are:\\n\\nA: [32/32, 5120/1] = [1, 5120]\\nB: [5120/1, 15360/46] = [5120, 334]\\nC: [32/32, 15360/46] = [1, 334]\\n\\nSize of A: 1 * 5120 * 2B = 10240 B\\nSize of B: 5120 * 334 * 2B = 3413760 B\\nSize of C: 1 * 334 * 2B = 668 B\\n\\nSince there are no temporal partitions, we do not have to circularly shift, instead, each core loads all the data needed to complete the local matrix multiplication.\\n\\n\" config=ConfigFile(F_op=[32, 1, 46], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=1, f_t_B_k=1, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)", "passed": true, "evaluation_result": {"F_op": [32, 1, 46], "f_t_A_m": 1, "f_t_A_k": 1, "f_t_B_k": 1, "f_t_B_n": 1, "f_t_C_m": 1, "f_t_C_n": 1, "score": 54.91312872775878, "t10_time": 7018, "ai_time": 113600.0, "passed": true}, "score": 54.91312872775878}
