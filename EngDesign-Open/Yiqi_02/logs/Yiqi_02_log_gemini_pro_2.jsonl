{"completion_tokens": 2089, "response": "reasoning=\"1. **Goal**: Minimize execution time for MatMul $C[m,n]+=A[m,k]*B[k,n]$ with $m=32, k=5120, n=15360$ on an IPU Mk2 with 1472 cores, each having 624KB SRAM and a $16 \\\\times 16$ systolic array.\\n2. **Operator Partitioning ($F_{op}$)**:\\n    *   $F_{op} = [F_{op_m}, F_{op_k}, F_{op_n}]$. The total number of cores used is $N_c = F_{op_m} \\\\cdot F_{op_k} \\\\cdot F_{op_n}$, which must be $\\\\le 1472$.\\n    *   To simplify the reduction logic for MatMul (summation over the $k$ dimension), $F_{op_k}=1$ is chosen. This means the entire $K$ dimension is processed within each core's sub-problem, avoiding the complexity of summing partial $C$ tensors across $F_{op_k}$ groups of cores if $F_{op_k} > 1$.\\n    *   For the $m$ dimension ($M=32$): Choosing $F_{op_m}=2$ results in $m_{sub} = M/F_{op_m} = 32/2=16$. This dimension aligns perfectly with the systolic array's dimension of 16, minimizing padding overhead for $m$.\\n    *   With $F_{op_m}=2$ and $F_{op_k}=1$, the constraint on $F_{op_n}$ becomes $F_{op_n} \\\\le 1472 / (2 \\\\cdot 1) = 736$. To maximize parallelism by using all available cores, $F_{op_n}=736$ is selected.\\n    *   Thus, the chosen operator partition factor is $F_{op} = [2, 1, 736]$. This configuration uses $2 \\\\times 1 \\\\times 736 = 1472$ cores.\\n3. **Sub-Problem Dimensions & Padding**: The dimensions of the sub-MatMul on each core are derived from $M, K, N$ and $F_{op}$. These sub-dimensions are then padded to be multiples of 16 for the systolic array.\\n    *   $m_{sub} = M/F_{op_m} = 32/2 = 16$. Padded: $m_{pad} = \\\\lceil 16 \\\\rceil_{16} = 16$.\\n    *   $k_{sub} = K/F_{op_k} = 5120/1 = 5120$. Padded: $k_{pad} = \\\\lceil 5120 \\\\rceil_{16} = 5120$ (since $5120 = 16 \\\\times 320$).\\n    *   $n_{sub} = N/F_{op_n} = 15360/736 \\\\approx 20.869$. Padded: $n_{pad} = \\\\lceil 20.869 \\\\rceil_{16} = 32$.\\n4. **Temporal Partition Factors ($f_t$)**: To minimize communication overhead and the number of internal compute steps ($S_{total} = S_m S_k S_n$), all temporal partition factors ($f_{t,X,dim}$) are set to 1. This strategy prioritizes execution speed, provided memory constraints are satisfied.\\n    *   $f_{t,A,m}=1, f_{t,A,k}=1, f_{t,B,k}=1, f_{t,B,n}=1, f_{t,C,m}=1, f_{t,C,n}=1$.\\n5. **Constraint Checks for $f_t$ factors** (as per T10 rules):\\n    *   For tensor A (dimensions $m,k$): The number of cores sharing a sub-tensor $A_{sub}$ is $P^A = F_{op_n} = 736$. The product of its temporal factors is $\\\\prod f_t^A = f_{t,A,m} \\\\cdot f_{t,A,k} = 1 \\\\cdot 1 = 1$. The number of rotation rings $R_A = P^A / \\\\prod f_t^A = 736/1 = 736$, which is an integer. This is valid.\\n    *   For tensor B (dimensions $k,n$): $P^B = F_{op_m} = 2$. $\\\\prod f_t^B = f_{t,B,k} \\\\cdot f_{t,B,n} = 1 \\\\cdot 1 = 1$. $R_B = P^B / \\\\prod f_t^B = 2/1 = 2$. Valid.\\n    *   For tensor C (dimensions $m,n$): $P^C = F_{op_k} = 1$. $\\\\prod f_t^C = f_{t,C,m} \\\\cdot f_{t,C,n} = 1 \\\\cdot 1 = 1$. $R_C = P^C / \\\\prod f_t^C = 1/1 = 1$. Valid.\\n    *   Alignment constraint: For any shared dimension $d$ between two tensors $X$ and $Y$, $f_{t,X,d}$ must be a factor or multiple of $f_{t,Y,d}$. Since all $f_t$ values are 1, this condition ($1$ is a factor/multiple of $1$) is satisfied for all shared dimensions ($k$ between A and B; $m$ between A and C; $n$ between B and C). Valid.\\n6. **Memory Calculation (per core, FP16 = 2 bytes/element)**: The memory footprint on each core is calculated based on the padded sub-problem dimensions and the temporal partition factors.\\n    *   $Mem_A = (m_{pad}/f_{t,A,m}) \\\\times (k_{pad}/f_{t,A,k}) \\\\times 2 = (16/1) \\\\times (5120/1) \\\\times 2 = 163,840$ bytes.\\n    *   $Mem_B = (k_{pad}/f_{t,B,k}) \\\\times (n_{pad}/f_{t,B,n}) \\\\times 2 = (5120/1) \\\\times (32/1) \\\\times 2 = 327,680$ bytes.\\n    *   $Mem_C = (m_{pad}/f_{t,C,m}) \\\\times (n_{pad}/f_{t,C,n}) \\\\times 2 = (16/1) \\\\times (32/1) \\\\times 2 = 1,024$ bytes.\\n    *   Total SRAM usage per core = $163840 + 327680 + 1024 = 492,544$ bytes.\\n    *   $492,544 \\\\text{ bytes} = 492544 / 1024 = 481 \\\\text{ KB}$.\\n    *   This is within the $624$ KB per-core SRAM limit. Valid.\\n7. **Execution Time Minimization**: The chosen $F_{op}$ utilizes all 1472 cores. Setting all $f_t=1$ minimizes the number of temporal compute-shift cycles ($S_{total}=S_m S_k S_n = 1 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\cdot 1 = 1$) and thereby reduces inter-core data shifting frequency associated with temporal partitioning. The computation per core involves a sub-matrix multiplication of effective size $16 \\\\times 5120 \\\\times (15360/736 \\\\approx 20.869)$, which is padded to $16 \\\\times 5120 \\\\times 32$. While this introduces some computational overhead due to padding on the $n$-dimension (approx. 34.8% of operations along $n$ are on padded data), distributing the overall MatMul over the maximum number of cores is generally favorable for performance. An alternative with $F_{op_n}=480$ (960 cores) would result in no padding on $n$ but would execute the same padded $16 \\\\times 5120 \\\\times 32$ task on fewer cores, leading to longer overall execution time.\" config=ConfigFile(F_op=[2, 1, 736], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=1, f_t_B_k=1, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)", "passed": true, "evaluation_result": {"F_op": [2, 1, 736], "f_t_A_m": 1, "f_t_A_k": 1, "f_t_B_k": 1, "f_t_B_n": 1, "f_t_C_m": 1, "f_t_C_n": 1, "score": 78.59624089624214, "t10_time": 7018, "ai_time": 16960.0, "passed": true}, "score": 78.59624089624214}
