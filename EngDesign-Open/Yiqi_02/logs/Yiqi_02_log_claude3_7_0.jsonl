{'completion_tokens': 1463, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="Let's approach this problem step by step to find an optimal execution plan for the matrix multiplication C[m,n] += A[m,k]*B[k,n] where m=32, k=5120, n=15360.\n\n## 1. Calculate Memory Requirements\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the memory size of each tensor (using FP16 which is 2 bytes per element):\n- Tensor A: m×k = 32×5120 = 163,840 elements = 327,680 bytes ≈ 320 KB\n- Tensor B: k×n = 5120×15360 = 78,643,200 elements = 157,286,400 bytes ≈ 150 MB\n- Tensor C: m×n = 32×15360 = 491,520 elements = 983,040 bytes ≈ 960 KB\n\nTotal memory required: ~151.28 MB\n\nEach core has 624 KB of memory, so we need to partition the tensors across multiple cores.\n\n## 2. Hardware Constraints\n\n- Each core has a 624 KB scratchpad memory\n- There are 1,472 cores available\n- The systolic array in each core is 16×16\n- All sub-matrices must be padded to be multiples of 16×16\n\n## 3. Partition Strategy\n\nSince tensor B is the largest (150 MB), it needs significant partitioning. We should partition along both the k and n dimensions to reduce its memory footprint on each core.\n\nLet's determine a good partition factor for F_op = [f_m, f_k, f_n]:\n\n### Initial Considerations:\n\n- The m dimension (32) is small and close to 16, so minimal partitioning is needed here\n- The k dimension (5120) is large and needs partitioning\n- The n dimension (15360) is very large and needs significant partitioning\n\n### Padding Effects:\n\n- Since m=32, if we use f_m=2, each partition would be 16, which matches perfectly with the 16×16 systolic array\n- For n and k, we should choose partition factors that make dimensions close to multiples of 16\n\n### Proposed F_op:\n\nLet's try F_op = [2, 16, 48]. This gives:\n- 2 partitions along m → each partition has m = 16 (perfect for the systolic array)\n- 16 partitions along k → each partition has k = 320 (multiple of 16)\n- 48 partitions along n → each partition has n = 320 (multiple of 16)\n\nTotal cores needed: 2×16×48 = 1,536 cores, which exceeds our 1,472 cores limit.\n\nLet's adjust to F_op = [2, 16, 46] → 2×16×46 = 1,472 cores (exactly our limit)\n\nWith this partition:\n- Sub-tensor A[m/2, k/16] = A[16, 320] = 5,120 elements = 10,240 bytes ≈ 10 KB\n- Sub-tensor B[k/16, n/46] = B[320, ~334] ≈ 106,880 elements = 213,760 bytes ≈ 209 KB\n- Sub-tensor C[m/2, n/46] = C[16, ~334] ≈ 5,344 elements = 10,688 bytes ≈ 10.4 KB\n\nTotal memory per core ≈ 229.4 KB < 624 KB (fits on each core)\n\n## 4. Temporal Partitioning Factors\n\nNow that we have the spatial partitioning, let's consider the temporal partitioning factors.\n\n### For Tensor A:\n- f_t_A_m = 1 (no temporal partitioning along m as it's already small)\n- f_t_A_k = 2 (partition k into 2 temporal partitions to allow rotation)\n\n### For Tensor B:\n- f_t_B_k = 2 (matching f_t_A_k for alignment)\n- f_t_B_n = 1 (no temporal partitioning along n as it's already well-partitioned spatially)\n\n### For Tensor C:\n- f_t_C_m = 1 (no temporal partitioning as it's already small)\n- f_t_C_n = 1 (no temporal partitioning as it's already well-partitioned spatially)\n\n## 5. Final Configuration\n\nOur execution plan is:\n- F_op = [2, 16, 46] (spatial partitioning for the operator)\n- f_t_A_m = 1 (temporal partitioning for tensor A on dimension m)\n- f_t_A_k = 2 (temporal partitioning for tensor A on dimension k)\n- f_t_B_k = 2 (temporal partitioning for tensor B on dimension k)\n- f_t_B_n = 1 (temporal partitioning for tensor B on dimension n)\n- f_t_C_m = 1 (temporal partitioning for tensor C on dimension m)\n- f_t_C_n = 1 (temporal partitioning for tensor C on dimension n)", config=ConfigFile(F_op=[2, 16, 46], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=2, f_t_B_k=2, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [2, 16, 46], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 2, 'f_t_B_k': 2, 'f_t_B_n': 1, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 1, 'score': np.float64(57.621239304480405), 't10_time': 7018, 'ai_time': np.float64(81366.0), 'passed': np.True_}, 'score': 57.621239304480405}
