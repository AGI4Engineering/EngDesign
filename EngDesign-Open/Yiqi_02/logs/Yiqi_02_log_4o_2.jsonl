{'completion_tokens': 525, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To derive an execution plan for the matrix multiplication on the IPU Mk2, we need to consider the constraints and requirements of the hardware and the T10 benchmark. The matrix multiplication is defined as C[m,n] += A[m,k]*B[k,n] with dimensions m=32, k=5120, and n=15360. The IPU Mk2 has 1472 cores, each with a 624KB scratchpad memory, and a high inter-core bandwidth.\n\n1. **Operator Partitioning (F_op):**\n   - We need to partition the operator along dimensions m, k, and n. Given the constraints, a reasonable partition could be F_op = [2, 4, 8]. This partitions the operator into 64 sub-operators, which can be distributed across the 1472 cores.\n\n2. **Temporal Partitioning (f_t):**\n   - For tensor A, we can temporally partition along dimensions m and k. A reasonable choice is f_t_A_m = 1 and f_t_A_k = 2, allowing for efficient use of the systolic array.\n   - For tensor B, we can temporally partition along dimensions k and n. A reasonable choice is f_t_B_k = 2 and f_t_B_n = 4.\n   - For tensor C, we can temporally partition along dimensions m and n. A reasonable choice is f_t_C_m = 1 and f_t_C_n = 4.\n\n3. **Alignment and Constraints:**\n   - The temporal partition factors must align across tensors. For example, f_t_A_k and f_t_B_k must be factors or multiples of each other, which they are (both are 2).\n   - The product of temporal partition factors should be a divisor of the number of cores sharing the sub-tensor, which is satisfied in this configuration.\n\n4. **Memory and Communication:**\n   - The partitioning ensures that the sub-tensor partitions do not overflow the per-core SRAM size.\n   - The compute-shift pattern minimizes communication overhead by aligning the rotations of rTensors.\n\nThis configuration balances the memory footprint and communication overhead, ensuring efficient execution on the IPU Mk2.', config=ConfigFile(F_op=[2, 4, 8], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=2, f_t_B_k=2, f_t_B_n=4, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=4)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [2, 4, 8], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 2, 'f_t_B_k': 2, 'f_t_B_n': 4, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 4, 'score': 20, 't10_time': 7018, 'ai_time': -1, 'passed': False}, 'score': 20.0}
