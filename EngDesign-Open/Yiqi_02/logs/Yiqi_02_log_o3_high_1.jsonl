Systolic array inside each core is 16\u00d716 \u21d2 every local m/k/n size should be multiple of 16 or it will be padded.\\n \u2022 We must choose spatial (F_op) + temporal (f_t) factors so that (1) the working-set of every core at every step fits in 624 KB, (2) \u22641472 cores are used, (3) alignment rules of T10 are met, (4) try to minimise exec time \u2192 expose as much parallelism as we can while keeping memory small and avoiding tiny (\u226a16) tiles.\\n\\nStep-2  \u2011  Decide spatial partition (F_op)\\n \u2022 m=32 is only 2\u00d716 \u21d2 we keep it whole (F_m = 1) so each core works on either 16 or 32 rows \u2013 both are multiples of 16, no padding waste.\\n \u2022 k = 5120 is large.  Splitting k spatially shrinks the size of both A and B blocks, therefore good for memory.  Choose F_k = 16 (5120/16 = 320, still a multiple of 16).\\n \u2022 n = 15360 is huge, perfect to expose more parallelism.  With k_sub = 320 we can afford up to n_sub = 768 (see memory check below).  15360/768 = 20 \u21d2 choose F_n = 20.\\n \u2022 Result  F_op = [1,16,20]  \u21d2 1\u00d716\u00d720 = 320 cores (\u226a1472).\\n\\nStep-3  \u2011  Memory check per core (one compute step)\\n  m_sub = 32 (later we will temporally stream it in two 16-row halves)\\n  k_sub (spatial) = 320\\n  n_sub (spatial) = 768\\n  A-tile  = 32\u00d7320\u00d72  = 20 480 B\\n  B-tile  = 320\u00d7768\u00d72 = 491 520 B\\n  C-tile  = 32\u00d7768\u00d72  = 49 152 B\\n  Total   = 561 152 B  < 638 976 B \u2192 fits.\\n  To give some headroom (e.g. accumulators, double-buffer), we slice the 32 rows temporally by 2: each step uses only 16 rows (A & C).

We set f_t_A_m = 2 (to implement the 16-row streaming) and f_t_A_k = 1.  Product 2 divides P=20 \u21d2 valid.\\n \u2022 Tensor B (dims k,n) is spatially unique to every core (16\u00d720 grid \u21d2 P=1).  Therefore it cannot be further temporally split.  Set f_t_B_k = 1, f_t_B_n = 1 (product 1 divides 1 \u21d2 OK).\\n \u2022 Tensor C (dims m,n) is spatially cut only along n (20) \u21d2 each C slice is shared by the 16 k-cores (P=16).  It must align with A on the m dimension, so choose f_t_C_m = 2, f_t_C_n = 1.  Product 2 divides 16 \u21d2 OK.\\n \u2022 Alignment rule check:\\n    \u2013 Along m:  f_t_A_m = f_t_C_m = 2 (aligned)\\n    \u2013 Along k:  f_t_A_k = f_t_B_k = 1 (aligned)\\n    \u2013 Along n:  f_t_B_n = f_t_C_n = 1 (aligned)\\n    All constraints are respected.\\n\\nStep-5  \u2011  Padding / utilisation\\n All local sub-dimensions are multiples of 16: m-step 16, k-slice 320, n-slice 768 \u21d2 no extra padding cycles, perfect utilisation of the 16\u00d716 array.\\n\\nStep-6  \u2011  Communication & computation picture\\n \u2022 320 cores run fully in parallel; each finishes its (m/2)\u00d7k_sub\u00d7n_sub GEMM in two m-steps.\\n \u2022 After compute each of the 16 k-cores that own the same (m_sub,n_sub) tile need to be reduced (sum) \u2013 can be implemented as a ring-all-reduce of 32 KB per participant, negligible versus computation.\\n \u2022 The chosen plan therefore balances memory (\u224884 % usage), good compute utilisation, moderate core count (320), and minimal shift traffic (only C needs a reduction, A rotation among 20 cores is read-only broadcast that can be overlapped or pre-loaded).\\n\\nStep-7  \u2011  Produce the required JSON.' config=ConfigFile(F_op=[1, 16, 20], f_t_A_m=2, f_t_A_k=1, f_t_B_k=1, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=2, f_t_C_n=1)", "passed": true, "evaluation_result": {"F_op": [1, 16, 20], "f_t_A_m": 2, "f_t_A_k": 1, "f_t_B_k": 1, "f_t_B_n": 1, "f_t_C_m": 2, "f_t_C_n": 1, "score": 55.06818981150057, "t10_time": 7018, "ai_time": 111274.0, "passed": true}, "score": 55.06818981150057}
