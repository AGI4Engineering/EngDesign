{'completion_tokens': 507, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To derive an execution plan for the matrix multiplication on the IPU Mk2, we need to consider the constraints and capabilities of the hardware, as well as the requirements of the T10 benchmark. The matrix multiplication is defined as C[m,n] += A[m,k]*B[k,n] with dimensions m=32, k=5120, and n=15360. The IPU Mk2 has 1472 cores, each with a 16x16 systolic array and 624KB of scratchpad memory.\n\n1. **Operator Partitioning (F_op):**\n   - We need to partition the operator along dimensions m, k, and n. Given the dimensions and the number of cores, a reasonable partitioning could be F_op = [2, 8, 16]. This results in 2 * 8 * 16 = 256 sub-operators, which is feasible within the 1472 cores.\n\n2. **Temporal Partitioning (f_t):**\n   - For tensor A, we can partition along m and k. Given F_op, a temporal partitioning could be f_t_A_m = 1 and f_t_A_k = 4.\n   - For tensor B, partition along k and n. A suitable partitioning could be f_t_B_k = 2 and f_t_B_n = 8.\n   - For tensor C, partition along m and n. A suitable partitioning could be f_t_C_m = 1 and f_t_C_n = 4.\n\n3. **Alignment and Constraints:**\n   - Ensure that the temporal partition factors align with the spatial partitioning and that they are factors of the replication number caused by spatial partitioning.\n   - The temporal factors for tensors sharing a common dimension should be factors or multiples of each other.\n\n4. **Memory and Communication:**\n   - Each core should handle a sub-tensor that fits within its 624KB memory.\n   - The communication overhead should be minimized by aligning the rotations of rTensors.\n\nThis plan ensures that the computation is distributed across the cores efficiently, with aligned rotations and minimal communication overhead.', config=ConfigFile(F_op=[2, 8, 16], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=4, f_t_B_k=2, f_t_B_n=8, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=4)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [2, 8, 16], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 4, 'f_t_B_k': 2, 'f_t_B_n': 8, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 4, 'score': 20, 't10_time': 7018, 'ai_time': -1, 'passed': False}, 'score': 20.0}
