{'completion_tokens': 449, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a multi-level page-table structure for both Device A and Device B, we need to consider the constraints and requirements provided. The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Determine Page Size**: The page size affects both the TLB hit rate and the number of entries per level. We need to choose a page size that balances these factors while satisfying the constraints on page-table memory overhead and average address translation time.\n\n2. **Calculate Number of Levels**: The number of levels in the page table is determined by the virtual address space and the page size. We need to ensure that the page table can map the entire virtual address space.\n\n3. **Determine Entries Per Level**: The number of entries per level is influenced by the page size and the number of levels. We need to ensure that the total number of entries can cover the physical memory size.\n\n4. **Compute Page Table Memory Overhead**: This is calculated based on the number of entries and the size of each PTE. We need to ensure this does not exceed the maximum allowed overhead.\n\n5. **Calculate Average Translation Time**: This includes the TLB access time and the time to access each level of the page table. We need to ensure this does not exceed the required average address translation time.\n\nFor Device A:\n- Physical Memory: 150 MB\n- Max Page-Table Memory Overhead: ≤ 320 KB\n- Required Avg. Address Translation Time: ≤ 150 ns\n\nFor Device B:\n- Physical Memory: 2 GB\n- Max Page-Table Memory Overhead: ≤ 4.05 MB\n- Required Avg.
