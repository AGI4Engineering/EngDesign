Understanding the driver model\n   A real VirtIO block driver must prepare three descriptors (request header, data buffer, status byte) and put them into the virt-queue, then sleep until the device raises an interrupt that wakes the waiting thread.  In our minimal educational environment there is no actual back-end device, so the driver is reduced to a checked copy between a pseudo "device buffer" kept in the VioblkDevice object (readbuf / writebuf) and the caller’s buffer.  What is still important is\n   • correct parameter validation (device open, alignment to block size, capacity checks …).\n   • proper mutual exclusion (vioblk_lock) while the request is "in flight".\n   • the condition variable that would be used in a full implementation is kept, but in our mock driver we "signal" it immediately after the copy so that the waiting thread can continue without hanging forever.\n\n2. Helper functions that already exist\n   lock_acquire / lock_release ‑ guarantee exclusive access to the device data structures.\n   condition_wait            ‑ would put the thread to sleep (not really needed in the mock path because we complete synchronously, but we still keep the call to illustrate the place where a real driver would wait).\n   condition_broadcast       ‑ wakes every thread waiting for vioblk_used_updated.\n\n3. vioblk_read implementation\n   • Reject if the driver or parameters are invalid.\n   • Check alignment (pos and bufsz must be multiples of blksz).\n   • Check that the requested region is inside capacity.\n   • Acquire the lock, create a request structure, set descriptors (skipped – we only emulate).\n   • Copy from vioblk.readbuf (which stands for the whole disk image) into caller’s buffer.\n   • Signal completion, release the lock and return the number of bytes copied.\n   • If caller passed an immutable bytes object instead of bytearray we cannot write into it, therefore we simply return a new bytes object carrying the data (classic Python convention used by e.g. os.read).  The return type therefore can be int (number of bytes copied when caller gave a bytearray) or the data itself when caller gave bytes; for the exercise the important part is the logic.\n\n4. vioblk_write implementation\n   • Performs the same validation.\n   • Acquire the lock, prepare descriptors (omitted), copy the data provided by the caller into vioblk.writebuf (our ‘disk’) at the requested offset.\n   • Broadcast completion and unlock.\n   • Return the number of bytes written.\n   • The hint in the statement (“you should call your read function”) is to remind that for a real device we might need to read-modify-write sectors that are partially overwritten.  Here we explicitly require full block alignment, therefore it can be ignored.\n\n5. Error handling\n   Every detected violation returns ‑1.\n   Capacity overflow returns ‑1.\n\nThe code below follows exactly this reasoning and keeps the public function signature unchanged.  All VirtIO specific constant/flag manipulation points are commented so that they could be replaced by the full low-level logic later without changing the interfaces.', config=ConfigFile(vioblk_read='def vioblk_read(vioblk: VioblkDevice, pos: int, buf: bytes, bufsz: int):\n    """Read *bufsz* bytes at position *pos* from a VirtIO block device into *buf*.\n\n    In the teaching environment there is no real device; *vioblk.readbuf* is\n    treated as the entire disk image.
