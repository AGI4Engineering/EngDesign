Using least‐squares, we form the normal equations by summing powers of x and products with y:\n\nLet Sx = Σx = 3,   Sx2 = Σx^2 = 19,   Sx3 = Σx^3 = 27,   Sx4 = Σx^4 = 115,\n    Sy = Σy = 30.3,   Sxy = Σ(x y) = 32.7,   Sx2y = Σ(x^2 y) = 168.7,  n=6.\n\nThe normal equations are:\n  115 a +  27 b + 19 c = 168.7\n   27 a +  19 b +  3 c =  32.7\n   19 a +   3 b +  6 c =  30.3\n\nSolving step by step: from the 2nd and 3rd equations we find a + b ≃ 1.002857, then express b = 1.002857 - a and c = (32.7 -27a -19b)/3.  Substituting into the first equation yields a ≃ 1.4786.  Then b ≃ 1.002857 -1.4786 = -0.4757, and c ≃ (32.7 -27·1.4786 -19·(-0.4757))/3 ≃ 0.6056.  These coefficients minimize the mean squared error for the given data.', config=ConfigFile(a=1.4786, b=-0.4757, c=0.6056)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'Coefficient a is correct': np.True_, 'Coefficient b is correct': np.True_, 'Coefficient c is correct': np.True_, 'Errors in the fit are within acceptable limits': np.True_}, 'score': 100}
