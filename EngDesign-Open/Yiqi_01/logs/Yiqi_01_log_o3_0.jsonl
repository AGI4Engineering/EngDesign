We keep k un-partitioned spatially (F_op[1]=1) so that every core can locally accumulate the whole reduction and we avoid an inter-core reduce-sum on C.\n3.  Spatially partition m and n:\n    • Choose f_m = 8  →  each core gets 128/8 = 16 rows  (multiple of 16, matches the 16-row systolic array height).\n    • Choose f_n = 64 →  each core gets 15360/64 = 240 cols (multiple of 16).\n    →  F_op = [8,1,64] uses 8*64 = 512 cores ≤1472.\n4.  Memory check before temporal splitting:\n    A sub-tensor per core (16×5120) = 81 920 elm = 160 KB.\n    B sub-tensor per core (5120×240) = 1 228 800 elm = 2.46 MB  →  too large.\n5.  Temporal partition k on both A and B by a factor 8 (f_t_A_k = f_t_B_k = 8).\n    Each step uses k_slice = 5120/8 = 640 (multiple of 16).\n    Per-step memory:\n        • A slice 16×640 = 10 240 elm = 20 KB\n        • B slice 640×240 = 153 600 elm = 307 KB\n        • C block 16×240 = 3 840 elm = 7.7 KB\n      Total ≈ 335 KB < 624 KB.\n6.  Temporal factors on other dimensions are all 1:\n        f_t_A_m = 1, f_t_B_n = 1, f_t_C_m = 1, f_t_C_n = 1.\n7.  Alignment / legality checks:\n    • k-dimension temporal factors: 8 (A) and 8 (B) → equal, aligned.\n    • For A, the spatial partition misses n, so each A block is shared by P = f_n = 64 cores.\n      Product of its temporal factors is 8 → 8 | 64, valid.\n    • For B, the spatial partition misses m, so each B block is shared by P = f_m = 8 cores.\n      Product of its temporal factors is 8 → 8 | 8, valid.\n    • C has no sharing (P=1) and its temporal product is 1.\n8.  All sub-matrices seen by the systolic array are multiples of 16×16, so no extra padding is required.  The plan fits SRAM, obeys T10 alignment rules, and needs only 512 of 1472 cores, leaving headroom for overlap or other operators.\n\nResulting execution-plan parameters are given below.', config=ConfigFile(F_op=[8, 1, 64], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=8, f_t_B_k=8, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)), 'passed': np.True_, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [8, 1, 64], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 8, 'f_t_B_k': 8, 'f_t_B_n': 1, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 1, 'score': np.float64(48.01698848511318), 't10_time': 28672, 'ai_time': np.float64(1605972.0), 'passed': np.True_}, 'score': np.float64(48.01698848511318)}
