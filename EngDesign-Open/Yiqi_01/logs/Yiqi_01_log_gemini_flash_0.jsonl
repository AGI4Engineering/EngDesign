{"completion_tokens": 1095, "response": "reasoning=\"Let's analyze the problem. We need to find a valid execution plan for matrix multiplication C[m,n] += A[m,k]*B[k,n] with m=128, k=5120, and n=15360 on an IPU chip with 1472 cores. The goal is to minimize execution time while respecting memory constraints (624KB per core) and T10 constraints.\\n\\nA reasonable strategy is to utilize as many cores as possible to distribute the computation and reduce the workload per core. Considering the dimensions m, k, and n, we need to choose partition factors F_op = [f_m, f_k, f_n] such that their product is less than or equal to the number of cores, 1472. We need to ensure the sub-tensors fit within the 624KB memory limit.\\n\\nLet's start by dividing the n dimension heavily because it's the largest. Try F_op = [1, 1, 1440]. The shape of submatrices on each core becomes [128, 5120] * [5120, 15360/1440] = [128, 5120] * [5120, 10.667]. We'll need to pad n to be divisible by 1440. We can round up, so n' = 15840. The submatrices shapes are [128, 5120] and [5120, 11]. Each element is 2 bytes. So the memory needed for A is 128 * 5120 * 2 = 1310720 bytes, which is too big. And 5120 * 11 * 2 = 112640 bytes, and C would be 128 * 11 * 2 = 2816 bytes. The total is still too big for the 624 KB per core. A must be further temporally partitioned.\\n\\nInstead of partitioning dimension n so heavily and causing padding, we will go for a more even partitioning. We can try F_op = [4, 8, 45].  4 * 8 * 45 = 1440 < 1472. The submatrices become A[128/4, 5120/8] * B[5120/8, 15360/45] = A[32, 640] * B[640, 341.333]. n has to be padded up to be divisble by 45, let's say it is 15480. A is now 32 * 640 * 2 = 40960 bytes. B is 640 * 344 * 2 = 439296 bytes. C is 32 * 344 * 2 = 22016 bytes. 40960 + 439296 + 22016 = 502272 < 624KB. This looks more reasonable.\\n\\nNow we assign temporal partition factors. For A: f_t_A_m = 1 and f_t_A_k = 1. For B: f_t_B_k = 1 and f_t_B_n = 1. For C: f_t_C_m = 1 and f_t_C_n = 1. This means we are not temporally partitioning them. We would need to make sure A, B, and C rotations all align, so each temporal partition factor needs to be a factor of others on shared dimensions. Since they are all 1, then they're trivially aligned.\\n\\nSo, the plan is:\\nF_op = [4, 8, 45]\\nf_t_A_m = 1\\nf_t_A_k = 1\\nf_t_B_k = 1\\nf_t_B_n = 1\\nf_t_C_m = 1\\nf_t_C_n = 1\\n\" config=ConfigFile(F_op=[4, 8, 45], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=1, f_t_B_k=1, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)", "passed": true, "evaluation_result": {"F_op": [4, 8, 45], "f_t_A_m": 1, "f_t_A_k": 1, "f_t_B_k": 1, "f_t_B_n": 1, "f_t_C_m": 1, "f_t_C_n": 1, "score": 83.11769296571744, "t10_time": 28672, "ai_time": 55520.0, "passed": true}, "score": 83.11769296571744}
