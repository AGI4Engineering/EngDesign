{"completion_tokens": 2798, "response": "reasoning='The problem requires deriving an execution plan for a matrix multiplication $C[m,n] += A[m,k]*B[k,n]$ with $m=128, k=5120, n=15360$ on an IPU Mk2 chip. The plan must adhere to several constraints: max 1472 cores, 624KB SRAM per core, systolic array alignment (16x16), and T10 partitioning rules.\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Input Parameters & Constraints:**\\\\n    *   Dimensions: $M=128, K=5120, N=15360$.\\\\n    *   Data type: FP16 (2 bytes per element).\\\\n    *   Max cores: 1472.\\\\n    *   Per-core SRAM: 624KB = 638976 bytes. This means max 319488 FP16 elements.\\\\n    *   Systolic array: Sub-computations on dimensions $m, k, n$ must be multiples of 16.\\\\n    *   T10 partition rules:\\\\n        *   Spatial partition factors $f_s$ are derived from operator partition factors $F_{op}=[F_{op,m}, F_{op,k}, F_{op,n}]$.\\\\n            $f_s^A=[F_{op,m}, F_{op,k}]$, $f_s^B=[F_{op,k}, F_{op,n}]$, $f_s^C=[F_{op,m}, F_{op,n}]$.\\\\n        *   Temporal partition product constraints: $\\\\prod f_t^X$ must divide $P_X$ (number of cores sharing a sub-tensor X).\\\\n            $P_A = F_{op,n}$, $P_B = F_{op,m}$, $P_C = F_{op,k}$.\\\\n            So, $(f_{t,A,m} \\\\cdot f_{t,A,k}) | F_{op,n}$; $(f_{t,B,k} \\\\cdot f_{t,B,n}) | F_{op,m}$; $(f_{t,C,m} \\\\cdot f_{t,C,n}) | F_{op,k}$.\\\\n        *   Alignment constraints: Temporal factors on common dimensions must be factors/multiples of each other.\\\\n            $f_{t,A,m} \\\\sim f_{t,C,m}$; $f_{t,A,k} \\\\sim f_{t,B,k}$; $f_{t,B,n} \\\\sim f_{t,C,n}$.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Strategy for Temporal Partition Factors ($f_t$):**\\\\n    *   To minimize memory for accumulator C and simplify control, C is typically not temporally partitioned: $f_{t,C,m}=1, f_{t,C,n}=1$.\\\\n    *   Alignment constraint $f_{t,A,m} \\\\sim f_{t,C,m}$ and $f_{t,B,n} \\\\sim f_{t,C,n}$. The simplest choice is $f_{t,A,m}=1$ and $f_{t,B,n}=1$.\\\\n    *   This leaves $f_{t,A,k}$ and $f_{t,B,k}$ for temporal partitioning along the K dimension.\\\\n    *   For alignment $f_{t,A,k} \\\\sim f_{t,B,k}$, assume $f_{t,A,k} = f_{t,B,k} = f_t_k$ for simplicity.\\\\n    *   With these choices, T10 constraints become:\\\\n        *   $(1 \\\\cdot f_t_k) | F_{op,n} \\\\implies f_t_k | F_{op,n}$.\\\\n        *   $(f_t_k \\\\cdot 1) | F_{op,m} \\\\implies f_t_k | F_{op,m}$.\\\\n        *   $(1 \\\\cdot 1) | F_{op,k} \\\\implies 1 | F_{op,k}$ (always true for $F_{op,k} \\\\ge 1$).\\\\n    *   So, $f_t_k$ must be a common divisor of $F_{op,m}$ and $F_{op,n}$.\\\\n\\\\n3.  **Strategy for Operator Partition Factors ($F_{op}$):**\\\\n    *   Number of cores used: $N_c = F_{op,m} \\\\cdot F_{op,k} \\\\cdot F_{op,n} \\\\le 1472$.\\\\n    *   $M=128 = 8 \\\\times 16$. Dimension $m$ is the smallest. To maximize parallelism along $m$ and ensure $M/F_{op,m}$ is a multiple of 16, set $F_{op,m}=8$. This makes $M_{tile_dim} = M/F_{op,m} = 16$.\\\\n    *   With $F_{op,m}=8$, the constraint $f_t_k | F_{op,m}$ implies $f_t_k | 8$. To maximize temporal partitioning (reduce memory), choose largest $f_t_k=8$.\\\\n    *   This implies $8 | F_{op,n}$ from $f_t_k | F_{op,n}$.\\\\n    *   Now, $F_{op,k} \\\\cdot F_{op,n} \\\\le 1472 / F_{op,m} = 1472 / 8 = 184$.\\\\n\\\\n4.  **Determining $F_{op,k}$ and $F_{op,n}$:**\\\\n    *   We need $F_{op,k} \\\\cdot F_{op,n} \\\\le 184$.\\\\n    *   $F_{op,n}$ must be a multiple of 8 and a divisor of $N/16 = 15360/16 = 960$.\\\\n    *   $K_{tile_dim} = K / (F_{op,k} \\\\cdot f_t_k) = 5120 / (F_{op,k} \\\\cdot 8) = 640 / F_{op,k}$. This must be a multiple of 16. So $F_{op,k}$ must divide $640/16 = 40$.\\\\n    *   $N_{tile_dim} = N / (F_{op,n} \\\\cdot f_{t,B,n}) = 15360 / (F_{op,n} \\\\cdot 1)$. This must be a multiple of 16. So $F_{op,n}$ must divide $15360/16=960$.\\\\n    *   Consider $F_{op,k}=1$. This often leads to good performance by keeping reduction dimension $K$ local for longer.\\\\n        *   If $F_{op,k}=1$, then $F_{op,n} \\\\le 184$.\\\\n        *   $F_{op,n}$ must be a multiple of 8 and divisor of 960. Largest such $F_{op,n} \\\\le 184$ is $F_{op,n}=160$ (since $160 = 8 \\\\times 20$ and $960/160=6$).\\\\n        *   This gives $F_{op} = [8, 1, 160]$.\\\\n        *   Number of cores: $8 \\\\times 1 \\\\times 160 = 1280$ cores ($\\\\le 1472$).\\\\n        *   Check divisibility for $f_t_k=8$: $f_t_k | F_{op,n} \\\\implies 8 | 160$ (True). $f_t_k | F_{op,m} \\\\implies 8 | 8$ (True).\\\\n\\\\n5.  **Memory Calculation for $F_{op}=[8,1,160]$ and $f_t$ values:**\\\\n    *   $f_{t,A,m}=1, f_{t,A,k}=8, f_{t,B,k}=8, f_{t,B,n}=1, f_{t,C,m}=1, f_{t,C,n}=1$.\\\\n    *   Tensor A partition dimensions: $M/(F_{op,m}f_{t,A,m}) \\\\times K/(F_{op,k}f_{t,A,k})$\\\\n        $= 128/(8 \\\\cdot 1) \\\\times 5120/(1 \\\\cdot 8) = 16 \\\\times 640$.\\\\n        Size A: $16 \\\\times 640 = 10240$ elements.\\\\n    *   Tensor B partition dimensions: $K/(F_{op,k}f_{t,B,k}) \\\\times N/(F_{op,n}f_{t,B,n})$\\\\n        $= 5120/(1 \\\\cdot 8) \\\\times 15360/(160 \\\\cdot 1) = 640 \\\\times 96$.\\\\n        Size B: $640 \\\\times 96 = 61440$ elements.\\\\n    *   Tensor C partition dimensions: $M/(F_{op,m}f_{t,C,m}) \\\\times N/(F_{op,n}f_{t,C,n})$\\\\n        $= 128/(8 \\\\cdot 1) \\\\times 15360/(160 \\\\cdot 1) = 16 \\\\times 96$.\\\\n        Size C: $16 \\\\times 96 = 1536$ elements.\\\\n    *   All dimensions (16, 640, 96) are multiples of 16, so no padding needed for systolic arrays.\\\\n    *   Total elements per core: $10240 + 61440 + 1536 = 73216$.\\\\n    *   Total memory per core: $73216 \\\\text{ elements} \\\\times 2 \\\\text{ bytes/element} = 146432 \\\\text{ bytes} = 143 \\\\text{ KB}$.\\\\n    *   This is well within the 624KB limit.\\\\n\\\\n6.  **Check $\\\\prod f_t | P_X$ Constraint:**\\\\n    *   For A: $P_A = F_{op,n} = 160$. $\\\\prod f_t^A = f_{t,A,m} \\\\cdot f_{t,A,k} = 1 \\\\cdot 8 = 8$. $8 | 160$. Valid.\\\\n    *   For B: $P_B = F_{op,m} = 8$. $\\\\prod f_t^B = f_{t,B,k} \\\\cdot f_{t,B,n} = 8 \\\\cdot 1 = 8$. $8 | 8$. Valid.\\\\n    *   For C: $P_C = F_{op,k} = 1$. $\\\\prod f_t^C = f_{t,C,m} \\\\cdot f_{t,C,n} = 1 \\\\cdot 1 = 1$. $1 | 1$. Valid.\\\\n\\\\n7.  **Final Plan:**\\\\n    This plan uses 1280 cores, fits memory constraints, aligns with systolic array requirements, and satisfies T10 rules. The large tile dimension along K ($K_{tile}=640$) suggests good arithmetic intensity.\\\\n' config=ConfigFile(F_op=[8, 1, 160], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=8, f_t_B_k=8, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)", "passed": true, "evaluation_result": {"F_op": [8, 1, 160], "f_t_A_m": 1, "f_t_A_k": 8, "f_t_B_k": 8, "f_t_B_n": 1, "f_t_C_m": 1, "f_t_C_n": 1, "score": 52.14547142786873, "t10_time": 28672, "ai_time": 699732.0, "passed": true}, "score": 52.14547142786873}
