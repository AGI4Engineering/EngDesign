{'completion_tokens': 481, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To derive an execution plan for the matrix multiplication on the IPU Mk2, we need to consider the constraints and requirements of the hardware and the T10 abstraction. The matrix multiplication is defined as C[m,n] += A[m,k]*B[k,n] with dimensions m=128, k=5120, and n=15360. The IPU Mk2 has 1472 cores, each with a 624KB scratchpad memory, and a high inter-core bandwidth.\n\n1. **Operator Partitioning (F_op):**\n   - We need to partition the operator along dimensions m, k, and n. Given the number of cores (1472), we can choose partition factors that multiply to a number close to 1472.\n   - A reasonable choice is F_op = [8, 4, 46], which gives 8 * 4 * 46 = 1472.\n\n2. **Temporal Partitioning (f_t):**\n   - For tensor A, we partition along m and k. A reasonable choice is f_t_A_m = 1 and f_t_A_k = 4.\n   - For tensor B, we partition along k and n. A reasonable choice is f_t_B_k = 4 and f_t_B_n = 1.\n   - For tensor C, we partition along m and n. A reasonable choice is f_t_C_m = 1 and f_t_C_n = 1.\n\n3. **Alignment and Constraints:**\n   - The temporal factors for tensors A and B along k must be aligned, which they are since both are 4.\n   - The product of temporal factors should divide the number of cores sharing the sub-tensor, which is satisfied here.\n\n4. **Memory and Communication:**\n   - The partitioning ensures that the sub-tensors fit within the per-core memory limits and minimizes communication overhead by aligning the temporal partitions.\n\nThis plan should efficiently utilize the IPU Mk2's resources while minimizing execution time.", config=ConfigFile(F_op=[8, 4, 46], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=4, f_t_B_k=4, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [8, 4, 46], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 4, 'f_t_B_k': 4, 'f_t_B_n': 1, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 1, 'score': 20, 't10_time': 28672, 'ai_time': -1, 'passed': False}, 'score': 20}
