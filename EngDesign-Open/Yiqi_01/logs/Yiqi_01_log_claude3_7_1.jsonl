{'completion_tokens': 1515, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="I need to derive an execution plan for a MatMul operation C[m,n] += A[m,k]*B[k,n] with m=128, k=5120, n=15360 on an IPU Mk2 chip with 1,472 cores, each with 624KB of memory and a 16×16 systolic array.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the memory requirements for the tensors:\n- A[128, 5120] in FP16: 128 × 5120 × 2 bytes = 1,310,720 bytes ≈ 1.25 MB\n- B[5120, 15360] in FP16: 5120 × 15360 × 2 bytes = 157,286,400 bytes ≈ 150 MB\n- C[128, 15360] in FP16: 128 × 15360 × 2 bytes = 3,932,160 bytes ≈ 3.75 MB\n\nThe total size of all tensors is about 155 MB, which exceeds the per-core memory of 624KB by a large margin. So we need to partition the tensors carefully.\n\n### Step 1: Consider operator partition factor F_op\n\nThe F_op vector [f_m, f_k, f_n] determines how to partition the MatMul operation spatially. I need to ensure:\n1. The total number of cores used (f_m × f_k × f_n) ≤ 1,472\n2. Each core has enough memory for its sub-tensors\n3. The partitioning aligns well with the 16×16 systolic array\n\nGiven the systolic array size of 16×16, I should try to make sub-tensor dimensions multiples of 16 to avoid padding overhead.\n\nInitial thoughts on F_op:\n- For dimension m=128: This is small, and 128=8×16, so I could use f_m=8 to get 16 rows per core\n- For dimension k=5120: This is large, splitting into f_k=8 or f_k=16 might be good\n- For dimension n=15360: This is very large, and 15360=960×16, so I need significant partitioning here\n\nI'll try F_op = [8, 16, 12], which gives 1,536 cores, slightly exceeding our limit of 1,472.\nLet me revise to F_op = [8, 16, 11], which gives 1,408 cores - within our limit.\n\nWith this partitioning:\n- Each core handles 16 rows and 320 columns of A (m/8=16, k/16=320)\n- Each core handles 320 rows and 1,396 columns of B (k/16=320, n/11=1,396)\n- Each core produces 16 rows and 1,396 columns of C (m/8=16, n/11=1,396)\n\nMemory per core:\n- A sub-tensor: 16 × 320 × 2 bytes = 10,240 bytes\n- B sub-tensor: 320 × 1,396 × 2 bytes = 892,736 bytes\n- C sub-tensor: 16 × 1,396 × 2 bytes = 44,672 bytes\n\nTotal: ~948KB, which exceeds the 624KB per-core memory. We need more temporal partitioning.\n\n### Step 2: Determine temporal partitioning factors\n\nSince B is the largest tensor, I should focus on temporally partitioning it. Let's set:\n- f_t_B_k = 4 (dividing k dimension) \n- f_t_B_n = 4 (dividing n dimension)\n\nThis will divide B into 16 pieces temporally, reducing its per-core memory to about 55KB. For alignment with B's temporal partitioning:\n- f_t_A_k = 4 (matching B's k partitioning)\n- f_t_A_m = 1 (no temporal partitioning needed here)\n- f_t_C_n = 4 (matching B's n partitioning)\n- f_t_C_m = 1 (no temporal partitioning needed here)\n\nWith these factors, the memory requirements per core become much more manageable:\n- A sub-tensor: 16 × (320/4) × 2 = 2,560 bytes per partition\n- B sub-tensor: (320/4) × (1,396/4) × 2 = 55,840 bytes per partition\n- C sub-tensor: 16 × (1,396/4) × 2 = 11,168 bytes per partition\n\nTotal per core: ~70KB, which easily fits within the 624KB memory limit.\n\nAfter further reflection, I believe we can optimize our plan by using fewer cores and increasing temporal partitioning slightly. Let's revise to:\n\nF_op = [8, 8, 16], using 1,024 cores\nf_t_A_m = 1 (no temporal partitioning on m)\nf_t_A_k = 4 (divide k into 4 temporal parts)\nf_t_B_k = 4 (divide k into 4 temporal parts)\nf_t_B_n = 4 (divide n into 4 temporal parts)\nf_t_C_m = 1 (no temporal partitioning on m)\nf_t_C_n = 4 (divide n into 4 temporal parts)\n\nThis should balance computation and communication well.", config=ConfigFile(F_op=[8, 8, 16], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=4, f_t_B_k=4, f_t_B_n=4, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=4)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [8, 8, 16], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 4, 'f_t_B_k': 4, 'f_t_B_n': 4, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 4, 'score': 20, 't10_time': 28672, 'ai_time': -1, 'passed': False}, 'score': 20}
