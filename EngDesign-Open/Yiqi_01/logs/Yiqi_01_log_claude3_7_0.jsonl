Given the total memory constraint of 624KB per core, we need to carefully choose F_op to ensure each core's computation fits in its local memory.\n\nThe IPU has 1,472 cores with systolic arrays of shape 16×16. For optimal performance, we should make sure each core computes a sub-matrix that aligns with the systolic array size.\n\nLet's try F_op = [8, 8, 192]:\n- Partitioning m into 8 parts: 128/8 = 16 (aligns with systolic array)\n- Partitioning k into 8 parts: 5120/8 = 640\n- Partitioning n into 192 parts: 15360/192 = 80 (multiple of 16)\n- Total cores used: 8 × 8 × 192 = 12,288 (too many)\n\nLet's try F_op = [8, 16, 11]:\n- Partitioning m into 8 parts: 128/8 = 16 (aligns with systolic array)\n- Partitioning k into 16 parts: 5120/16 = 320\n- Partitioning n into 11 parts: 15360/11 ≈ 1396.36 ≈ 1396 (we'll need to pad to 1408, which is 16×88)\n- Total cores used: 8 × 16 × 11 = 1,408 (within the 1,472 core limit)\n\n## Step 3: Calculate memory requirements per core with this partitioning\nWith F_op = [8, 16, 11], each core will handle:\n- A sub-tensor: [16, 320] * 2 bytes = 10,240 bytes\n- B sub-tensor: [320, 1408] * 2 bytes = 901,120 bytes (exceeds core memory of 624KB)\n\nLet's revise to F_op = [8, 40, 11]:\n- m partitioned into 8 parts: 128/8 = 16\n- k partitioned into 40 parts: 5120/40 = 128\n- n partitioned into 11 parts: 15360/11 ≈ 1396.36 ≈ 1396 (pad to 1408)\n- Total cores used: 8 × 40 × 11 = 3,520 (exceeds core limit)\n\nLet's try F_op = [8, 20, 8]:\n- m partitioned into 8 parts: 128/8 = 16\n- k partitioned into 20 parts: 5120/20 = 256\n- n partitioned into 8 parts: 15360/8 = 1920\n- Total cores used: 8 × 20 × 8 = 1,280 (within core limit)\n\nMemory per core:\n- A sub-tensor: [16, 256] * 2 bytes = 8,192 bytes\n- B sub-tensor: [256, 1920] * 2 bytes = 983,040 bytes (still exceeds core memory)\n\nWe need to use temporal partitioning to reduce memory requirements.\n\n## Step 4: Determine temporal partitioning factors\n\nLet's finalize F_op = [8, 10, 18]:\n- m partitioned into 8 parts: 128/8 = 16 (matches systolic array)\n- k partitioned into 10 parts: 5120/10 = 512 \n- n partitioned into 18 parts: 15360/18 = 853.33 ≈ 853 (pad to 864 for alignment to 16)\n- Total cores used: 8 × 10 × 18 = 1,440 (within the 1,472 core limit)\n\nThis gives us:\n- A sub-tensor: [16, 512] * 2 bytes = 16,384 bytes\n- B sub-tensor: [512, 864] * 2 bytes = 884,736 bytes (exceeds core memory)\n- C sub-tensor: [16, 864] * 2 bytes = 27,648 bytes\n\nWe need temporal partitioning to make it fit.\n\nFor tensor A:\n- f_t_A_m = 1 (no temporal partitioning on m)\n- f_t_A_k = 4 (divide k dimension into 4 temporal partitions: 512/4 = 128)\n\nFor tensor B:\n- f_t_B_k = 4 (maintain alignment with A's temporal partitioning)\n- f_t_B_n = 2 (divide n dimension into 2 temporal partitions: 864/2 = 432)\n\nFor tensor C:\n- f_t_C_m = 1 (no temporal partitioning needed)\n- f_t_C_n = 2 (align with B's temporal partitioning)\n\nWith this configuration:\n- A sub-tensor partition: [16, 128] * 2 bytes = 4,096 bytes\n- B sub-tensor partition: [128, 432] * 2 bytes = 110,592 bytes\n- C sub-tensor partition: [16, 432] * 2 bytes = 13,824 bytes\n\nTotal memory per core: 128,512 bytes ≈ 125.5 KB (well within the 624KB limit)\n\nThis configuration provides a good balance of parallelism, memory usage, and alignment with the systolic array architecture.", config=ConfigFile(F_op=[8, 10, 18], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=4, f_t_B_k=4, f_t_B_n=2, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=2)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [8, 10, 18], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 4, 'f_t_B_k': 4, 'f_t_B_n': 2, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 2, 'score': 20, 't10_time': 28672, 'ai_time': -1, 'passed': False}, 'score': 20}
