{"completion_tokens": 852, "response": "reasoning=\"Let's analyze the problem. The matrix multiplication is $C[m,n] += A[m,k]*B[k,n]$, with $m = 128$, $k = 5120$, and $n = 15360$. The IPU Mk2 has 1472 cores, each with 624KB of memory. We need to find $F_{op}$, $f_t_A_m$, $f_t_A_k$, $f_t_B_k$, $f_t_B_n$, $f_t_C_m$, and $f_t_C_n$ such that the memory constraints are met, the partition factors are valid, and the execution time is minimized. The data type is FP16 (2 bytes). The total on-chip memory is 896MB.\\n\\nFirst, consider using all 1472 cores. We can set $F_{op} = [m_f, k_f, n_f]$ where $m_f * k_f * n_f <= 1472$.  The memory requirement per core is approximately proportional to $\\\\frac{m}{m_f} * \\\\frac{k}{k_f} * 2 + \\\\frac{k}{k_f} * \\\\frac{n}{n_f} * 2 + \\\\frac{m}{m_f} * \\\\frac{n}{n_f} * 2$. We will simplify this to roughly A + B + C size per core, which must be less than 624KB = 624 * 1024 bytes.\\n\\nA possible starting point is to distribute the workload equally across dimensions. Since $1472 \\\\approx 12^3 / 2 + 12^2$, we could try setting $F_{op} = [16, 4, 23]$, which uses $16 * 4 * 23 = 1472$ cores. Now each core has a submatrix calculation of size m/16 * k/4 and k/4 * n/23.\\n\\nThen each core needs to store approx (128/16)*(5120/4)*2 + (5120/4)*(15360/23)*2 + (128/16)*(15360/23)*2 = 160*2 + 80*160*2 + 8*668*2 = 320 + 25600 + 10688 = 36608 Bytes which is << 624KB, meaning that the memory footprint is low enough. We will choose f_t = 1, meaning no temporal partitioning for simplicity\\n\\nSo we have $F_{op} = [16, 4, 23]$, $f_t_A_m = 1$, $f_t_A_k = 1$, $f_t_B_k = 1$, $f_t_B_n = 1$, $f_t_C_m = 1$, and $f_t_C_n = 1$.\\n\" config=ConfigFile(F_op=[16, 4, 23], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=1, f_t_B_k=1, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)", "passed": true, "evaluation_result": {"F_op": [16, 4, 23], "f_t_A_m": 1, "f_t_A_k": 1, "f_t_B_k": 1, "f_t_B_n": 1, "f_t_C_m": 1, "f_t_C_n": 1, "score": 75.84828589477641, "t10_time": 28672, "ai_time": 80320.0, "passed": true}, "score": 75.84828589477641}
