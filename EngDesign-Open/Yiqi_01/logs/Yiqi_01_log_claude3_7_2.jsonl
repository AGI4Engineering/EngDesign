I'll analyze the requirements and constraints step-by-step.\n\n## 1. Memory Analysis\n\nFirst, let's calculate the memory requirements of the entire matrices:\n- A[m,k] = 128 × 5120 elements × 2 bytes = 1,310,720 bytes ≈ 1.25 MB\n- B[k,n] = 5120 × 15360 elements × 2 bytes = 157,286,400 bytes ≈ 150 MB\n- C[m,n] = 128 × 15360 elements × 2 bytes = 3,932,160 bytes ≈ 3.75 MB\n\nThe total memory requirement is approximately 155 MB. Each core has 624 KB of scratchpad memory, which is not enough to store the entire matrices, especially matrix B. Therefore, I need to partition the matrices across cores and use a temporal shifting scheme.\n\n## 2. Core Memory and Systolic Array Constraints\n\nEach core has:\n- 624 KB of scratchpad memory\n- 16×16 systolic array for efficient matrix multiplication\n\nThe sub-matrices assigned to each core should ideally be divisible by 16 to align with the systolic array dimensions.\n\n## 3. Partitioning Strategy\n\nTo determine the operator partition factors F_op=[f_m, f_k, f_n], I need to balance:\n- Memory usage per core\n- Efficient use of the systolic array\n- Number of cores used (≤ 1,472)\n- Communication overhead\n\nLet's try different partitioning schemes:\n\n### Proposed scheme: F_op = [8, 5, 12]\n\nThis would divide the matrices as follows:\n- Sub-matrix A[m/8, k/5] = [16, 1024] elements = 32,768 bytes\n- Sub-matrix B[k/5, n/12] = [1024, 1280] elements = 2,621,440 bytes ≈ 2.5 MB\n- Sub-matrix C[m/8, n/12] = [16, 1280] elements = 40,960 bytes\n\nThis exceeds the per-core memory of 624 KB. We need to further reduce memory with temporal partitioning.\n\n### Revised scheme: F_op = [8, 16, 12]\n\nThis divides the matrices as follows:\n- Sub-matrix A[m/8, k/16] = [16, 320] elements = 10,240 bytes\n- Sub-matrix B[k/16, n/12] = [320, 1280] elements = 819,200 bytes ≈ 800 KB\n- Sub-matrix C[m/8, n/12] = [16, 1280] elements = 40,960 bytes\n\nTotal per-core memory: approximately 850 KB, which still exceeds 624 KB. Need more partitioning.\n\n### Final scheme: F_op = [8, 16, 24]\n\nThis divides the matrices as follows:\n- Sub-matrix A[m/8, k/16] = [16, 320] elements = 10,240 bytes\n- Sub-matrix B[k/16, n/24] = [320, 640] elements = 409,600 bytes ≈ 400 KB\n- Sub-matrix C[m/8, n/24] = [16, 640] elements = 20,480 bytes\n\nTotal per-core memory: approximately 430 KB, which fits within the 624 KB limit.\n\nTotal cores used: 8 × 16 × 24 = 3,072 cores\nThis exceeds our 1,472 core limit, so we need to reduce the number of spatial partitions and compensate with temporal partitioning.\n\n### Adjusted scheme: F_op = [4, 8, 46]\n\nThis would use 4 × 8 × 46 = 1,472 cores, right at our limit.\n\n## 4. Temporal Partitioning\n\nNow I need to determine the temporal partition factors to ensure we don't exceed memory constraints while minimizing communication costs.\n\nFor tensor A, with spatial partitioning on [m,k] as [4,8]:\n- f_t_A_m = 2: We split each sub-tensor A along dimension m into 2 partitions\n- f_t_A_k = 2: We split each sub-tensor A along dimension k into 2 partitions\n\nFor tensor B, with spatial partitioning on [k,n] as [8,46]:\n- f_t_B_k = 2: We split each sub-tensor B along dimension k into 2 partitions\n- f_t_B_n = 2: We split each sub-tensor B along dimension n into 2 partitions\n\nFor tensor C, with spatial partitioning on [m,n] as [4,46]:\n- f_t_C_m = 1: No temporal partitioning needed for C along m\n- f_t_C_n = 1: No temporal partitioning needed for C along n\n\n## 5. Final Configuration\n\nBased on the analysis above, the execution plan is:\n- F_op = [4, 8, 46]\n- f_t_A_m = 2\n- f_t_A_k = 2\n- f_t_B_k = 2\n- f_t_B_n = 2\n- f_t_C_m = 1\n- f_t_C_n = 1", config=ConfigFile(F_op=[4, 8, 46], f_t_A_m=2, f_t_A_k=2, f_t_B_k=2, f_t_B_n=2, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [4, 8, 46], 'f_t_A_m': 2, 'f_t_A_k': 2, 'f_t_B_k': 2, 'f_t_B_n': 2, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 1, 'score': 20, 't10_time': 28672, 'ai_time': -1, 'passed': False}, 'score': 20}
