{'completion_tokens': 528, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To derive an execution plan for the matrix multiplication on the IPU Mk2, we need to consider the constraints and capabilities of the hardware, as well as the requirements of the T10 benchmark. The matrix multiplication is defined as C[m,n] += A[m,k]*B[k,n] with dimensions m=128, k=5120, and n=15360. The IPU Mk2 has 1472 cores, each with a 624KB scratchpad memory, and a high inter-core bandwidth.\\n\\n1. **Operator Partitioning (F_op):**\\n   - We need to partition the operator along dimensions m, k, and n.\\n   - The total number of sub-operators should not exceed 1472 cores.\\n   - A reasonable partition could be F_op = [4, 8, 46], which results in 4 * 8 * 46 = 1472 sub-operators, utilizing all cores.\\n\\n2. **Temporal Partitioning (f_t):**\\n   - Temporal partitioning is needed to manage memory and communication.\\n   - For tensor A, partition along m and k: f_t_A_m = 1, f_t_A_k = 2.\\n   - For tensor B, partition along k and n: f_t_B_k = 2, f_t_B_n = 1.\\n   - For tensor C, partition along m and n: f_t_C_m = 1, f_t_C_n = 1.\\n\\n3. **Alignment and Constraints:**\\n   - Ensure that temporal factors align across shared dimensions.\\n   - f_t_A_k and f_t_B_k are both 2, ensuring alignment along k.\\n   - The temporal factors should be divisors of the number of cores sharing the sub-tensor.\\n\\n4. **Memory and Communication:**\\n   - Each core handles a sub-matrix that fits within its 624KB memory.\\n   - The partitioning minimizes communication by aligning shifts and computation.\\n\\nThis plan ensures efficient use of the IPU's resources, aligns with T10's constraints, and aims to minimize execution time by balancing computation and communication.", config=ConfigFile(F_op=[4, 8, 46], f_t_A_m=1, f_t_A_k=2, f_t_B_k=2, f_t_B_n=1, f_t_C_m=1, f_t_C_n=1)), 'passed': np.True_, 'evaluation_result': {'F_op': [4, 8, 46], 'f_t_A_m': 1, 'f_t_A_k': 2, 'f_t_B_k': 2, 'f_t_B_n': 1, 'f_t_C_m': 1, 'f_t_C_n': 1, 'score': np.float64(63.752108506500875), 't10_time': 28672, 'ai_time': np.float64(182960.0), 'passed': np.True_}, 'score': np.float64(63.752108506500875)}
