## Task Description

You are tasked to design a flexible and efficient color mapping system for a Tetris game implemented on an FPGA development board with VGA output. The objective is to ensure distinct visual representation of all gameplay elements while operating under hardware resource constraints.

A VGA display of 640x480 pixels and RGB444 color depth is available. Only a maximum of 10 distinct color mappings can be active at any time due to memory limitations. Additionally, your design should handle dynamic gameplay states, including a Night Mode that adjusts the color palette for low-light visibility.


### Task 1: Define Color Mapping and Screen Regions
Define color schemes for different game elements such as the Tetris playfield, active tetrominoes, next piece preview, background, UI panels, and game over screen.
Each tetromino (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z) must have distinguishable default colors.
Designate display regions for playfield, next piece preview, and score display by specifying pixel coordinate boundaries.
Respect the 10-color definition constraint.

### Task 2: Design Dynamic Mode Handling
Create a Night Mode theme that switches colors to darker palettes suitable for low-light gameplay.
Ensure smooth and logical color remapping when transitioning between normal and Night Mode.

### Task 3: Optimize Hardware Resource Usage
Implement bit slicing strategies for efficient pixel-to-grid mapping.
Avoid expensive multiplication or division in hardware logic.

### Task 4: Validate and Discuss Your Design
Propose a simple method to validate that color mappings are correctly applied under different game states.
Discuss trade-offs made between visual richness, resource constraints, and adaptability.
Suggest one innovative feature or future improvement to the color mapping system.
