{'completion_tokens': 5648, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The original reply failed the JSON validator because the string that was supposed to hold the Python implementation was written as a raw, multi-line snippet bounded by Markdown back-ticks.  In JSON, strings must escape embedded newlines (with \\n) and quotes (with \\"), otherwise the document is syntactically invalid.  The fix therefore consists of:\n1. Removing the Markdown ``` wrappers.\n2. Encoding the code as a normal JSON string with every newline replaced by \\n and every internal quote escaped.\n3. Returning the whole object that matches the provided schema.\n\nBelow, the write() implementation is identical in logic to the previous answerâ€”it resolves the path, validates the offset, allocates extra blocks if necessary, performs the byte-wise updates, adjusts inode.size, and returns the mutated FileSystemImage.
