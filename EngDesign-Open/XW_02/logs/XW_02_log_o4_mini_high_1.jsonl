Split the given path into components and traverse from root inode (1) through directories to locate the target file inode, raising FileNotFoundError if any component is missing.\n2. If the found inode refers to a directory, raise IsADirectoryError.\n3. Validate that write position pos is between 0 and the file's current size, otherwise raise ValueError.\n4. Encode the input data string into UTF-8 bytes and compute the new end offset.\n5. Determine current capacity from allocated blocks and block size. If new end exceeds capacity, allocate additional blocks via fs_img.allocate_block and update inode.direct_blocks accordingly.\n6. For each block in the write range, calculate the offset and length of the chunk to write, merge with existing block content (padding with zero bytes for holes), and update fs_img.data_blocks.\n7. Update inode.size to the maximum of its old size and the new end offset.\n8.
