reasoning='1. **Analyze Noise Type**: The provided image appears to have a mixture of noise types: noticeable salt-and-pepper noise (sporadic black-and-white pixels) and Gaussian noise evident from the grainy texture.\n\n2. **Review Noise and Strategy**: \n   - *Salt-and-Pepper Noise*: Spontaneous white and black pixels; handled well by the median filter.\n   - *Gaussian Noise*: Distributed noise with a bell-curve distribution; effectively reduced with a Gaussian filter.\n   - Given the mixed noise type, a combination of median filtering and Gaussian filtering will be necessary.\n\n3. **Filter Strategy**:\n   - **Median Filter**: First apply to remove salt-and-pepper noise while preserving edges. A kernel size of 3 is typically sufficient for moderate noise.\n   - **Gaussian Filter**: Apply after median filtering to smooth the remaining Gaussian noise. Use a small sigma value and a kernel size of 5x5.\n\n4. **Specify Parameters**:\n   - *Median Filter*: `ksize=3`\n   - *Gaussian Filter*: `ksize=5, sigma=1`\n\n5. **Python Code**:\n   The sequence of filters applied comprises a median filter followed by a Gaussian filter, tailored to remove the observed noise types.' config=ConfigFile(denoising_strategy='Apply a median filter to address salt-and-pepper noise followed by a Gaussian filter for Gaussian noise.', filter_sequence=['median(ksize=3)', 'gaussian(ksize=5, sigma=1)'], function_code='def denoise_image(noisy_img):\n    import cv2\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    # Apply a median filter to reduce salt-and-pepper noise\n    median_filtered = cv2.medianBlur(noisy_img, 3)\n    \n    # Apply a Gaussian filter to reduce Gaussian noise\n    gaussian_filtered = cv2.GaussianBlur(median_filtered, (5, 5), 1)\n    \n    # Output the final filtered image\n    filtered_img = gaussian_filtered\n\n    return filtered_img')
