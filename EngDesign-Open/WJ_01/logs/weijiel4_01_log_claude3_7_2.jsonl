The noise appears to have a speckled pattern with random color variations throughout the image\n2. The noise shows up as small colored dots (red, green, blue, etc.) scattered across the entire image\n3. The noise pattern resembles film grain or color salt-and-pepper noise\n4. The noise significantly affects the image quality but underlying structures are still visible\n\nThis appears to be predominantly color Gaussian noise (also known as additive Gaussian noise) with high variance. The random speckling with various colors is characteristic of this type of noise. The image has a reddish-pink tint overall, suggesting there might also be some color bias in the noise.\n\n## Step 2: Determine an appropriate denoising strategy\nFor this type of noise, a combination of approaches will be effective:\n\n1. Non-local means denoising - excellent for preserving details while removing Gaussian noise\n2. Bilateral filtering - good for edge preservation while reducing noise\n3. Color space transformation - working in different color spaces can help isolate and remove noise\n\nSince we need to preserve details while removing significant noise, a multi-stage approach using these techniques should be effective.\n\n## Step 3: Design the filter sequence\nI'll design a multi-stage filtering approach:\n\n1. First apply a bilateral filter to reduce noise while preserving edges\n2. Then use non-local means denoising which is excellent for Gaussian noise\n3. Add a small amount of Gaussian blurring to handle any remaining noise\n4. Use a detail-preserving filter like guided filter to enhance details\n\n## Step 4: Implement the solution\nI'll now write a function that implements this strategy:", config=ConfigFile(denoising_strategy="The image appears to be corrupted with high-intensity color Gaussian noise. The noise manifests as random color speckles distributed across the entire image, giving it a grainy appearance with a pinkish-red tint. To address this, I will use a multi-stage approach: First, apply a bilateral filter which reduces noise while preserving important edges. Next, use non-local means denoising which is specifically designed for Gaussian noise and excels at preserving texture details.
