{'completion_tokens': 1181, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Let me analyze the image to understand the type of noise and determine the best denoising strategy.\n\n1. Noise Analysis:\nLooking at the provided image, I can observe the following:\n- The image has a significant amount of colored noise (speckles throughout the image)\n- The noise appears to be primarily additive color noise with a fine-grained pattern\n- The noise has a somewhat uniform distribution across the image\n- The noise resembles what\'s typically referred to as multicolored Gaussian or "salt and pepper"-like noise\n- The image colors appear to have a strong reddish/pinkish tint, suggesting some color channel imbalance\n\n2. Denoising Strategy:\nGiven the characteristics observed, I\'ll design a multi-step filtering strategy that:\n- Tackles both the color noise and preserves details\n- Reduces the speckle pattern while maintaining image structure\n- Improves color balance\n- Preserves edges and important features\n\nThe noise appears to be a mixture of Gaussian-like noise and impulse noise with color distortion. A combination of filtering techniques will be necessary.\n\n3. Filter Selection and Sequencing:\n- First, I\'ll use Non-Local Means denoising which is excellent for Gaussian noise while preserving details\n- Next, a bilateral filter to reduce remaining noise while preserving edges\n- Then a light median filter to address any remaining impulse noise\n- Finally some color correction to address the color imbalance\n\n4. Implementation Plan:\nI\'ll implement this strategy using OpenCV\'s built-in functions for each of these filters with carefully tuned parameters to balance noise reduction and detail preservation.\n\nNow I\'ll code the denoising function based on this analysis.', config=ConfigFile(denoising_strategy="The image is corrupted with a mixture of colored noise that appears to be predominantly Gaussian with some impulse-like characteristics and color distortion.
