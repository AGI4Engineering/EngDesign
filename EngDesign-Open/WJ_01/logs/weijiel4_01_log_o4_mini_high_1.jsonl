{'completion_tokens': 4229, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Noise Analysis:\n   - Observed colored pixel speckles distributed throughout the image, characteristic of impulse (salt-and-pepper) noise in each channel.\n   - Underlying grainy texture suggests additive Gaussian noise overlay.\n   - Conclusion: we are facing a mixture of salt-and-pepper and Gaussian noise on a color image.\n\n2. Noise types & filters:\n   - Salt-and-pepper (impulse) noise: best removed by a median filter to eliminate isolated outliers while preserving edges.\n   - Gaussian noise: best mitigated by edge-preserving smoothers such as bilateral filtering or non-local means denoising.\n\n3. Filtering strategy:\n   - Step 1: median filter with ksize=3 to eliminate impulse noise.\n   - Step 2: bilateral filter (d=9, sigmaColor=75, sigmaSpace=75) to reduce moderate Gaussian fluctuations while keeping edges intact.\n   - Step 3: non-local means denoising (cv2.fastNlMeansDenoisingColored with h=10, hColor=10, templateWindowSize=7, searchWindowSize=21) to refine and remove residual Gaussian noise without blurring textures.\n\n4. Parameter choices:\n   - median ksize=3: small footprint to remove isolated spikes.\n   - bilateral d=9: neighborhood size sufficient for medium-scale smoothing; sigmaColor/\u200bsigmaSpace trade detail vs. noise.\n   - fastNlMeans h=10, hColor=10: moderate filtering strength; templateWindowSize=7 and searchWindowSize=21 balance quality and speed.\n\n5.
