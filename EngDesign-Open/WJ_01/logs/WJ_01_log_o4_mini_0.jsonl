{'completion_tokens': 2000, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Step 1: Noise analysis\n- By inspecting the provided color image, we observe random multi-colored speckles across all channels. This pattern is characteristic of additive colored Gaussian noise rather than impulse (salt-and-pepper) or structured (periodic) noise. There are no clear dead pixels or white/black spots that would indicate salt-and-pepper noise.\n\nStep 2: Denoising strategy overview\n- Gaussian noise in images is best addressed by smoothing filters that reduce noise while preserving edges and textures.\n- Bilateral filtering performs edge-preserving smoothing by combining domain and range weighting.\n- Non-local means denoising (fastNlMeansDenoisingColored in OpenCV) further reduces Gaussian noise by patch-based weighted averaging, exploiting image self-similarity.\n- Combining a bilateral filter (to remove fine grain noise while preserving edges) followed by non-local means (to further smooth homogeneous areas without over-blurring) often yields very good results on colored Gaussian noise.\n\nStep 3: Filter sequence and parameters\n1. bilateral(d=9, sigmaColor=75, sigmaSpace=75)\n   - d=9: diameter of each pixel neighborhood\n   - sigmaColor=75: filter sigma in the color space (higher → more smoothing)\n   - sigmaSpace=75: filter sigma in the coordinate space (higher → larger neighborhood)\n2. fastNlMeansColored(h=10, hColor=10, templateWindowSize=7, searchWindowSize=21)\n   - h=10: filter strength for luminance component\n   - hColor=10: filter strength for color components\n   - templateWindowSize=7: size of the template patch used for denoising\n   - searchWindowSize=21: size of the window used to search for similar patches\n\nStep 4: Code implementation\n- We implement a single function denoise_image(noisy_img) that applies the two filters in sequence.\n- The function assumes cv2 and numpy (as np) are available in its namespace.\n', config=ConfigFile(denoising_strategy='The image is corrupted by additive colored Gaussian noise without significant impulse or structured noise.
