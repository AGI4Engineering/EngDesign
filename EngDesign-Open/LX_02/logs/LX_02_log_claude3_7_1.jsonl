Linearizing the nonlinear equation\n\nGiven the nonlinear equation: $\\ddot{y} = 1 - \\frac{u^2}{y^2}$\n\nFirst, I'll define the state variables:\n- $x_1 = y$ (position)\n- $x_2 = \\dot{y}$ (velocity)\n\nThis gives us:\n$\\dot{x}_1 = x_2$\n$\\dot{x}_2 = 1 - \\frac{u^2}{x_1^2}$\n\nThe equilibrium point is at $(y_0, u_0) = (1, 1)$, or in state variables, $(x_{10}, x_{20}, u_0) = (1, 0, 1)$.\n\nTo linearize, I need to compute the Jacobian matrices:\n- $A = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_1}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_1}{\\partial x_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_2}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_2}{\\partial x_2} \\end{bmatrix}$ evaluated at the equilibrium\n- $B = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_1}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_2}{\\partial u} \\end{bmatrix}$ evaluated at the equilibrium\n\nComputing each element:\n- $\\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_1}{\\partial x_1} = 0$\n- $\\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_1}{\\partial x_2} = 1$\n- $\\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_2}{\\partial x_1} = \\frac{2u^2}{x_1^3} = \\frac{2(1)^2}{(1)^3} = 2$ at equilibrium\n- $\\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_2}{\\partial x_2} = 0$\n- $\\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_1}{\\partial u} = 0$\n- $\\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_2}{\\partial u} = -\\frac{2u}{x_1^2} = -\\frac{2(1)}{(1)^2} = -2$ at equilibrium\n\nTherefore:\n$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$B = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ -2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSo: $a_{11} = 0, a_{12} = 1, a_{21} = 2, a_{22} = 0, b_{11} = 0, b_{21} = -2$\n\n### 2. Determining feedback gain K\n\nI need to find K = [k1 k2] such that the closed-loop poles are at -1±j1.\n\nThe closed-loop system matrix is A-BK:\n$A-BK = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ -2 \\end{bmatrix}[k_1 \\ k_2] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 2+2k_1 & 2k_2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n$|sI - (A-BK)| = s^2 - 2k_2 s - (2+2k_1) = 0$\n\nFor poles at -1±j1, the characteristic polynomial is:\n$(s-(-1+j1))(s-(-1-j1)) = (s+1-j1)(s+1+j1) = s^2 + 2s + 2$\n\nComparing coefficients:\n$-2k_2 = 2 \\implies k_2 = -1$\n$-(2+2k_1) = 2 \\implies 2+2k_1 = -2 \\implies k_1 = -2$\n\nTherefore, K = [-2 -1]\n\n### 3. Designing a full-order observer\n\nFor observer design, I need to find L = [l1 l2]' such that eigenvalues of (A-LC) are at -5 and -6.\n\nWith C = [1 0] (measuring only position), the observer dynamics matrix is:\n$A-LC = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} l_1 \\\\ l_2 \\end{bmatrix}[1 \\ 0] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0-l_1 & 1 \\\\ 2-l_2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -l_1 & 1 \\\\ 2-l_2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n$|sI - (A-LC)| = s^2 + l_1 s + (2-l_2) = 0$\n\nFor poles at -5 and -6, the characteristic polynomial is:\n$(s+5)(s+6) = s^2 + 11s + 30$\n\nComparing coefficients:\n$l_1 = 11$\n$2-l_2 = 30 \\implies l_2 = 2-30 = -28$\n\nTherefore, L = [11 -28]'\n\n### 4. Simulating the controller for nonlinear model\n\nTo determine if initial conditions are within the region of asymptotic stability, I need to analyze the behavior of the system with the designed controller and observer.\n\nFor the closed-loop system with observer, we need to verify if the states converge to the equilibrium point from the given initial conditions. The observer starts at (1,0).\n\nI need to determine whether each initial condition converges to the equilibrium:\n\na) (2, 2): Given the behavior of such systems, this is likely to be unstable as it's far from equilibrium in both position and velocity. The positive velocity will carry the ball further from equilibrium, and the magnetic force might not be strong enough to pull it back. I'll set s1 = 0 (not stable).\n\nb) (2.5, 0): This is even further from equilibrium than case (a) in position, though starting with zero velocity. The ball is likely too far for the magnetic force to pull it back. I'll set s2 = 0 (not stable).\n\nc) (0.8, 0): This is relatively close to the equilibrium position (1,0) and below it. The controller should be able to stabilize from this position. I'll set s3 = 1 (stable).\n\nd) (0.9, -1): This is also relatively close to equilibrium position but has a negative velocity. Since the starting position is below equilibrium and moving down, the controller might struggle to recover. However, since it's still close enough to equilibrium, I'll set s4 = 1 (stable).", config=ConfigFile(a11=0.0, a12=1.0, a21=2.0, a22=0.0, b11=0.0, b21=-2.0, k1=-2.0, k2=-1.0, l1=11.0, l2=-28.0, s1=0, s2=0, s3=1, s4=1)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'A': 'A is correct', 'B': 'B is correct', 'K': 'K is correct', 'L': 'L is wrong', 'Stability': 'i.c.(1) is wrong    i.c.(2) is correct    i.c.(3) is correct    i.c.(4) is wrong'}, 'score': 58.0}
