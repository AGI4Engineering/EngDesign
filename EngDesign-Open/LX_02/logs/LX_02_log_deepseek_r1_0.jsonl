The state variables are x1=y and x2=ẏ. The Jacobian matrices yield A=[[0,1],[2,0]] and B=[[0],[-2]].\n2. For pole placement at -1±j1, the feedback gain K is calculated using characteristic equation matching, resulting in K=[-2,-1].\n3. Observer design for eigenvalues -5,-6 uses the observability matrix and characteristic equation, leading to L=[11,32].\n4. Stability analysis considers proximity to equilibrium (1,0). Initial conditions (2,2) and (2.5,0) are too far, (0.8,0) is close, and (0.9,-1) has a destabilizing velocity, hence s1=0, s2=0, s3=1, s4=0.', config=ConfigFile(a11=0.0, a12=1.0, a21=2.0, a22=0.0, b11=0.0, b21=-2.0, k1=-2.0, k2=-1.0, l1=11.0, l2=32.0, s1=0, s2=0, s3=1, s4=0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'A': 'A is correct', 'B': 'B is correct', 'K': 'K is correct', 'L': 'L is correct', 'Stability': 'i.c.(1) is wrong    i.c.(2) is correct    i.c.(3) is correct    i.c.(4) is correct'}, 'score': 84.0}
