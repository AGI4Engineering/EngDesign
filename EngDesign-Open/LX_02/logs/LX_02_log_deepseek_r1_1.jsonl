The Jacobian matrices A and B are computed by taking partial derivatives of the system equations. For A: df1/dx1=0, df1/dx2=1; df2/dx1=2, df2/dx2=0. For B: df1/du=0, df2/du=-2. Thus, A=[[0,1],[2,0]], B=[[0],[-2]].\n2. Desired poles at -1±j1 require characteristic equation s²+2s+2. Using Ackermann's formula, K=[-2,-1] places closed-loop poles correctly.\n3.
