The state variables are x1 = y - 1 and x2 = ẏ. Jacobian matrices yield A = [[0,1],[2,0]] and B = [0,-2].\n2. Feedback gain K: Desired poles at -1±j1 require characteristic equation s² + 2s + 2. Solving K gives K = [-2, -1].\n3. Observer design: Eigenvalues at -5, -6 lead to L = [11,32] via pole placement for (A-LC).\n4. Stability assessment: Initial conditions (a) and (b) are far from equilibrium and likely unstable. (c) is near equilibrium and stable. (d) has negative velocity causing potential instability.', config=ConfigFile(a11=0.0, a12=1.0, a21=2.0, a22=0.0, b11=0.0, b21=-2.0, k1=-2.0, k2=-1.0, l1=11.0, l2=32.0, s1=0, s2=0, s3=1, s4=0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'A': 'A is correct', 'B': 'B is correct', 'K': 'K is correct', 'L': 'L is correct', 'Stability': 'i.c.(1) is wrong    i.c.(2) is correct    i.c.(3) is correct    i.c.(4) is correct'}, 'score': 84.0}
