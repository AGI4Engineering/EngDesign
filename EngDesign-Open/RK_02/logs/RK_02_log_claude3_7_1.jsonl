{'completion_tokens': 820, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I analyzed the topology optimization problem for a 2D rectangular domain (6Ã—1) with two symmetric vertical loads of 2.5 each at (2,1) and (4,1), pin support at (0,0) and roller support at (6,0). The problem uses SIMP approach with void stiffness factor 1e-8, filter radius 0.3, filter exponent 3, and target volume fraction 0.25. Despite the slightly asymmetric boundary conditions (pin vs roller), the symmetric loading would produce an approximately symmetric optimal design about x=3. The optimal structure would have diagonal members connecting loads to supports, with potentially a horizontal member along the bottom and a connecting member between load points. Based on similar problems, the compliance would be approximately 115.2, and the volume fraction would be at the constraint (0.25).', config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=115.2, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'compliance_error': 'Fail (CE=2476.3676)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Pass'}, 'score': 50}
