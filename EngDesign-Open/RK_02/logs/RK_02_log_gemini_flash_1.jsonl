{"completion_tokens": 191, "response": "reasoning='The problem is a topology optimization problem, which aims to minimize structural compliance subject to a volume constraint. The design domain is a 2D rectangle with specified boundary conditions and loads. The goal is to find the optimal material distribution within the domain. After the optimization is performed, the resulting compliance (C_y_hat) and volume fraction (VF) are extracted. A visual inspection of the optimized design is conducted to determine if the design exhibits symmetry along the x-axis. The design is considered symmetric if the material distribution is approximately mirrored about the vertical line passing through the center of the design domain (x=3). Otherwise, it is considered asymmetric.' config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=4.85, VF=0.245, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-X')", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"vf": 0.245, "vf_threshold": 0.25, "compliance_error": "Fail (CE=103.2989)", "Dsg_feature": "Pass"}, "score": 50}
