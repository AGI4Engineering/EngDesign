The grid was modeled with obstacles identified from the Webots world file. A* explored nodes by prioritizing those with the lowest estimated total cost (g + h), where g is the cost from the start, and h is the Euclidean heuristic to the goal. The path was constructed by moving around vertical walls at x=10 and x=30, the horizontal wall at y=20, and obstacle clusters. 8-connected movement allowed diagonal steps (cost âˆš2) where possible, reducing the total path length compared to 4-connected.
