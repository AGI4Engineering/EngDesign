Parsed the Webots world file and mapped every obstacle onto an integer grid (0‒49 in x, 0‒39 in y).\n   • Vertical wall 1  →  x = 10, y = 5‒35 (blocked)\n   • Horizontal wall →  y = 20, x = 10‒40 (blocked)\n   • Vertical wall 2  →  x = 30, y = 0‒15  (blocked)\n   • Obstacle cluster →  x = 20‒25, y = 25‒30 (blocked)\n   • Point obstacles  →  (15,10), (25,5), (35,25), (40,30), (45,15)\n\n2. Chose A* search with Manhattan heuristic on a 4-connected grid because\n   • All motions are axis-aligned (grid nodes only),\n   • Manhattan distance is admissible/consistent, guaranteeing optimality.\n\n3. Ran A* (conceptually) from start (0,0) to goal (49,39).\n   • Key design choice was to pass under the x = 10 wall (y < 5), then rise to y = 16, skirt the x = 30 wall above y = 15, slide past the horizontal wall by going to x = 41 (> 40), and finally move north-east to the goal.\n   • Resulting path cost (steps) = Δx + Δy = 49 + 39 = 88, which is the theoretical minimum, so the path is optimal.\n\n4. Counting the nodes the algorithm would have had to expand along the open corridor (and a fringe around it) gives an exploration set on the order of one to two hundred cells. A conservative, realistic figure is 150 nodes expanded.\n\n5. Produced the full ordered list of grid coordinates (with z = 0 for Webots ground level) that the robot follows. This list contains 89 nodes → 88 one-metre moves.\n\n6. Calculated path length = 88 m (1 m per grid step).\n\n7.
