First, we split the given path into its parent path and the name of the new file or directory. Then, we look up the parent path in the filesystem image to ensure it exists and is a directory. If the parent path is valid, we check if the name already exists in the parent directory to avoid duplicates. Next, we allocate a new inode for the new file or directory. If the new entry is a directory, we initialize its child entry list. Finally, we add a directory entry in the parent directory mapping the name to the new inode's number and return the mutated filesystem image.", config=ConfigFile(read='def read(fs_img: FileSystemImage, name: str, pos: int, length: int) -> str:\n    """Read up to `length` bytes from file `name` starting at offset `pos`."""\n    pass', write='def write(fs_img: FileSystemImage, name: str, pos: int, data: str) -> FileSystemImage:\n    """Write UTFâ€‘8 bytes of `data` into file `name` at offset `pos` and return the updated image."""\n    pass', create='def create(fs_img: FileSystemImage, path: str, is_dir: bool = False) -> FileSystemImage:\n    """Create a new file or directory at `path`, returning the mutated image."""\n    pass', delete='def delete(fs_img: FileSystemImage, path: str) -> FileSystemImage:\n    """Delete the entry at `path` and return the updated image."""\n    pass')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'create_file': False, 'create_dir': False, 'file_not_found': False, 'not_a_directory': False, 'file_exists': False}, 'score': 0}
