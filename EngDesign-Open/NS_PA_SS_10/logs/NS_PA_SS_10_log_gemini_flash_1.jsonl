{"completion_tokens": 714, "response": "reasoning=\"The problem is to design a serial input divisible by 5 detector. The module should maintain a state representing the current remainder modulo 5. On each clock cycle, a new bit is shifted in, and the state is updated based on the previous remainder and the new bit. The output is 1 if the new remainder is 0, and 0 otherwise. The module also has an active-low reset signal.  I will implement this using a state machine with 5 states, one for each possible remainder (0-4). I will use synchronous logic for the state updates and output generation.\\n\\nThe state transition logic will be as follows:\\n\\nIf the current remainder is 'r' and the input bit is 'd', the new remainder will be (2*r + d) % 5.\\n\\nHere is the state transition table:\\n\\n| Current Remainder | Input Bit | Next Remainder |\\n|-------------------|-----------|----------------|\\n| 0                 | 0         | 0              |\\n| 0                 | 1         | 1              |\\n| 1                 | 0         | 2              |\\n| 1                 | 1         | 3              |\\n| 2                 | 0         | 4              |\\n| 2                 | 1         | 0              |\\n| 3                 | 0         | 1              |\\n| 3                 | 1         | 2              |\\n| 4                 | 0         | 3              |\\n| 4                 | 1         | 4              |\" code='module divisible_by_5 (\\n    input  logic clk,\\n    input  logic resetn,\\n    input  logic din,\\n    output logic dout\\n);\\n\\n  typedef enum logic [2:0] {S0, S1, S2, S3, S4} state_t;\\n  state_t current_state, next_state;\\n\\n  always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\\n    if (!resetn) begin\\n      current_state <= S0;\\n    end else begin\\n      current_state <= next_state;\\n    end\\n  end\\n\\n  always_comb begin\\n    case (current_state)\\n      S0: begin\\n        if (din) next_state = S1; else next_state = S0;\\n      end\\n      S1: begin\\n        if (din) next_state = S3; else next_state = S2;\\n      end\\n      S2: begin\\n        if (din) next_state = S0; else next_state = S4;\\n      end\\n      S3: begin\\n        if (din) next_state = S2; else next_state = S1;\\n      end\\n      S4: begin\\n        if (din) next_state = S4; else next_state = S3;\\n      end\\n      default: next_state = S0;\\n    endcase\\n  end\\n\\n  assign dout = (current_state == S0);\\n\\nendmodule\\n'", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"compile_error": "tb.sv:11: error: Unknown module type: model\n2 error(s) during elaboration.\n*** These modules were missing:\n        model referenced 1 times.\n***"}, "score": 0}
