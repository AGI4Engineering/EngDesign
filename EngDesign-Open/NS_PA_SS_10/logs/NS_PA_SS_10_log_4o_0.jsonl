{'completion_tokens': 732, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design a synthesizable SystemVerilog module for a serial-input "divisible-by-5" detector, we need to implement a finite state machine (FSM) that tracks the remainder of the cumulative binary value when divided by 5. The FSM will have five states, corresponding to remainders 0 through 4. The module will process an arbitrarily long bitstream, one bit per clock cycle, and output a high signal when the cumulative value is divisible by 5.\n\n### Steps to Implement:\n1. **Define the Module and Ports:**\n   - The module will have inputs for the clock (`clk`), a synchronous active-low reset (`resetn`), and the serial input bit (`din`). It will have an output (`dout`) that indicates if the current cumulative value is divisible by 5.\n\n2. **State Register:**\n   - Use a 3-bit register to hold the current remainder. This is sufficient because we only need to track remainders 0 through 4.\n\n3. **State Transition Logic:**\n   - On each clock cycle, if `resetn` is high, compute the new remainder based on the current remainder and the input bit. The new remainder can be calculated as `(current_remainder << 1) + din) % 5`.\n   - If `resetn` is low, reset the remainder to 0.\n\n4. **Output Logic:**\n   - Set `dout` to 1 if the new remainder is 0, otherwise set it to 0.\n\n5. **Synchronous Logic:**\n   - Ensure all logic is synchronous to the clock, and the output is valid in the same cycle the new bit is processed.\n\n6. **Comments and Clean Code:**\n   - Add comments to explain the functionality of each part of the code for clarity and maintainability.', code="module model (\n    input  logic clk,      // clock signal\n    input  logic resetn,   // synchronous, active‐low reset: clears history\n    input  logic din,      // serial input bit, MSB first\n    output logic dout      // high if the current value mod 5 == 0\n);\n\n    // State register to hold the current remainder\n    logic [2:0] remainder;\n\n    // Combinational logic to calculate the next remainder\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin\n            remainder <= 3'd0; // Reset remainder to 0\n            dout <= 1'b0;      // Reset output to 0\n        end else begin\n            // Calculate new remainder\n            case (remainder)\n                3'd0: remainder <= din ? 3'd1 : 3'd0;\n                3'd1: remainder <= din ? 3'd3 : 3'd2;\n                3'd2: remainder <= din ? 3'd0 : 3'd4;\n                3'd3: remainder <= din ? 3'd2 : 3'd1;\n                3'd4: remainder <= din ? 3'd4 : 3'd3;\n                default: remainder <= 3'd0; // Default case for safety\n            endcase\n            // Set output based on the new remainder\n            dout <= (remainder == 3'd0);\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule"), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'test0_pass': False, 'test1_pass': True, 'test2_pass': True}, 'score': 70}
