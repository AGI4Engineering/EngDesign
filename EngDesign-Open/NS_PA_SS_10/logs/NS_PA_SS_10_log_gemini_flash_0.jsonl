{"completion_tokens": 431, "response": "reasoning='The design requires a module that takes a serial input, processes it bit by bit, and outputs a 1 if the accumulated binary value is divisible by 5.  The module must handle arbitrarily long bitstreams and be synthesizable. The core of the design is a state machine that tracks the remainder when the current value is divided by 5.  I will implement this using a SystemVerilog module with the specified inputs and outputs, and a state variable representing the remainder modulo 5. I will also implement the combinational logic to calculate the next remainder and the output based on the current remainder and the input bit.  Finally, I will add the reset logic.' code=\"module divisible_by_5 (\\n    input  logic clk,      // clock signal\\n    input  logic resetn,   // synchronous, active-low reset: clears history\\n    input  logic din,      // serial input bit, MSB first\\n    output logic dout      // high if the current value mod 5 == 0\\n);\\n\\n  // State variable to store the current remainder modulo 5\\n  logic [2:0] remainder;\\n\\n  // Next state variable\\n  logic [2:0] next_remainder;\\n\\n  // Combinational logic to determine the next remainder\\n  always_comb begin\\n    next_remainder = (remainder * 2 + din) % 5;\\n  end\\n\\n  // Sequential logic to update the remainder and output\\n  always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\\n    if (!resetn) begin\\n      remainder <= 3'b000; // Reset to 0\\n      dout <= 1'b0;\\n    end else begin\\n      remainder <= next_remainder;\\n      dout <= (next_remainder == 0); // Output 1 if remainder is 0\\n    end\\n  end\\n\\nendmodule\\n\"", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"compile_error": "tb.sv:11: error: Unknown module type: model\n2 error(s) during elaboration.\n*** These modules were missing:\n        model referenced 1 times.\n***"}, "score": 0}
