{'completion_tokens': 689, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design a synthesizable SystemVerilog module for a serial-input "divisible-by-5" detector, we need to implement a finite state machine (FSM) that tracks the remainder of the cumulative binary value when divided by 5. The FSM will have five states, corresponding to remainders 0 through 4. The module will process an arbitrarily long bitstream, one bit per clock cycle, and output a high signal when the cumulative value is divisible by 5.\n\n1. **Module Definition**: The module will have a clock input (`clk`), a synchronous active-low reset (`resetn`), a serial data input (`din`), and a data output (`dout`).\n\n2. **State Register**: A 3-bit register will be used to store the current remainder. This is sufficient because we only need to track remainders 0 through 4.\n\n3. **State Transition Logic**: On each rising edge of the clock, if `resetn` is high, the module will compute the new remainder based on the current remainder and the input bit `din`. The new remainder is calculated as `(old_remainder << 1) + din) % 5`. This can be simplified using combinational logic based on the current remainder and `din`.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output `dout` is set to 1 if the new remainder is 0, indicating that the cumulative value is divisible by 5.\n\n5. **Reset Logic**: When `resetn` is low, the remainder is reset to 0, and `dout` is set to 0.\n\nThe following SystemVerilog code implements this logic, ensuring all operations are synchronous to the clock and that the output is valid in the same cycle the new bit is processed.', code="module model (\n    input  logic clk,      // clock signal\n    input  logic resetn,   // synchronous, active‐low reset: clears history\n    input  logic din,      // serial input bit, MSB first\n    output logic dout      // high if the current value mod 5 == 0\n);\n\n    // State register to hold the current remainder\n    logic [2:0] remainder;\n\n    // Combinational logic to determine the next state\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin\n            remainder <= 3'b000; // Reset state\n            dout <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            case (remainder)\n                3'b000: remainder <= din ? 3'b001 : 3'b000;\n                3'b001: remainder <= din ? 3'b011 : 3'b010;\n                3'b010: remainder <= din ? 3'b000 : 3'b100;\n                3'b011: remainder <= din ? 3'b010 : 3'b001;\n                3'b100: remainder <= din ? 3'b100 : 3'b011;\n                default: remainder <= 3'b000; // Default case for safety\n            endcase\n            dout <= (remainder == 3'b000);\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule"), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'test0_pass': False, 'test1_pass': True, 'test2_pass': True}, 'score': 70}
