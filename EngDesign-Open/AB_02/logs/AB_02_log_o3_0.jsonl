Load the colour image from the hard-coded path. If loading fails, return None so the caller can handle the error gracefully.\n2. Convert to grayscale – Watershed needs a binary mask preparatory stage, and grayscale simplifies thresholding.\n3. Apply Otsu adaptive threshold combined with THRESH_BINARY_INV to obtain white (255) foreground and black (0) background because the pips/numerals are darker than the white card border.\n4. Clean small speckles caused by noise via morphological opening with a 3×3 kernel (two iterations).\n5. Compute the sure background by dilating the cleaned mask (three iterations) so that we are confident those pixels are background.\n6. Compute the distance transform on the cleaned mask; large values occur at the centres of the foreground blobs. Threshold at 70 % of the maximum distance to obtain the sure foreground.\n7. Unknown pixels = sure background – sure foreground; these are the border areas we are unsure about.\n8. Label the connected components in the sure foreground. Increment all labels by 1 so the background becomes label 1 (requested format by Watershed). Assign 0 to unknown pixels.\n9. Invoke cv2.watershed on the original colour image with the prepared markers. Watershed floods the gradient landscape, separating touching objects and labelling boundaries with –1.\n10. Build the final binary mask: every pixel whose marker value is >1 is considered object (255). Background and watershed ridge (–1) are 0.\n11.
