If image loading fails, it returns None.\n2) It converts the loaded image to grayscale.\n3) Then a binary threshold utilizing Otsu’s thresholding is applied to obtain an initial foreground vs. background separation.\n4) The resulting binary mask is cleaned by morphological opening (using a 3x3 kernel, 2 iterations).\n5) Next, we obtain the sure background by dilating the opened mask (3x3 kernel, 3 iterations).\n6) To get the sure foreground, a distance transform is performed on the opened mask with cv2.DIST_L2 and a 5×5 mask. Those pixels above 70% of the maximum distance are considered sure foreground.\n7) The unknown region is the difference between the dilated background and the sure foreground.\n8) We label components within the sure foreground using cv2.connectedComponents.\n9) The labels are adjusted (incremented) and the unknown region is set to 0 in the markers, so that the watershed algorithm will treat it correctly.\n10) The cv2.watershed function is run on the original image with the markers. Finally, the foreground components of the markers (all values above 1) are set to 255 in the output mask, while the rest are 0.\n11) The function returns this final binary mask as a numpy array.", solution_code="import cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\n\ndef segment_image():\n    # Step 1: Load the original color image\n    img = cv2.imread('images/8_of_hearts.png')\n    if img is None:\n        # Could not load the image\n        return None\n\n    # Convert to grayscale\n    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n\n    # Step 2: Threshold using Otsu's method\n    _, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)\n\n    # Step 3: Morphological opening to remove noise\n    kernel = np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8)\n    opening = cv2.morphologyEx(thresh, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel, iterations=2)\n\n    # Step 4: Sure background by dilation\n    sure_bg = cv2.dilate(opening, kernel, iterations=3)\n\n    # Step 5: Sure foreground via distance transform\n    dist_transform = cv2.distanceTransform(opening, cv2.DIST_L2, 5)\n    # Threshold based on 70% of the max distance\n    sure_fg = (dist_transform > 0.7 * dist_transform.max()).astype(np.uint8) * 255\n\n    # Step 6: Identify unknown region\n    sure_fg_255 = sure_fg.copy()\n    sure_fg_bool = sure_fg_255.astype(bool)\n    unknown = cv2.subtract(sure_bg, sure_fg_255)\n\n    # Step 7: Label markers\n    num_labels, markers = cv2.connectedComponents(sure_fg)\n\n    # Step 8: Add 1 to all labels so that sure background is not 0\n    markers = markers + 1\n\n    # Mark unknown regions as 0\n    markers[unknown == 255] = 0\n\n    # Step 9: Apply watershed\n    cv2.watershed(img, markers)\n\n    # Step 10: Create final mask from watershed result\n    # Foreground is marked by markers > 1\n    mask = np.where(markers > 1, 255, 0).astype(np.uint8)\n\n    return mask\n")), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'solution_code_extracted': True, 'ground_truth_loaded': True, 'solution_function_loaded': True, 'prediction_mask_generated': True, 'iou_score': np.float64(0.8336422896720309), 'pass_threshold': 0.8, 'temp_file_cleaned': True}, 'score': 83.36422896720309}
