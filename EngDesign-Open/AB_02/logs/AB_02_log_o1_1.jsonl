The image is loaded from the specified path in color. If it fails, the function returns None.\n2. A grayscale version of the image is generated.\n3. Otsu's thresholding is applied using THRESH_BINARY_INV to separate red heart shapes from the white background.\n4. Morphological opening with a 3×3 kernel (2 iterations) is done to clean up small noise.\n5. The background region is identified by further dilating the opened image.\n6. The foreground region is found by applying a distance transform to the thresholded image, then choosing a threshold at 0.7×(distance transform's maximum) to create a sure-foreground mask.\n7. The unknown region is then computed by subtracting the foreground from the background.\n8. Connected components are found in the sure-foreground mask to label each foreground region.\n9. Those labels (markers) are incremented by 1 to separate them from the background, and the unknown region is labeled as 0.\n10. The markers are passed to cv2.watershed along with the original color image for segmentation.\n11.
