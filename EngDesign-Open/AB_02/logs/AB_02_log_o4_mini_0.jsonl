Import necessary libraries (cv2 for OpenCV, numpy for numerical operations).\n2. Define segment_image() with no arguments, using the hardcoded path 'images/8_of_hearts.png'.\n3. Load the color image; return None on failure.\n4. Convert the loaded image to grayscale.\n5. Apply Otsu’s binary inverse thresholding to separate foreground (red shapes and numerals remain white) from background.\n6. Perform morphological opening (3×3 kernel, 2 iterations) to remove small noise.\n7. Dilate the opened image (3×3 kernel, 3 iterations) to obtain the sure background region.\n8. Compute the distance transform on the opened image and threshold at 0.7 × max distance to get the sure foreground region.\n9. Convert sure foreground to uint8 and compute the unknown region by subtracting sure foreground from sure background.\n10. Label connected components in the sure foreground to create initial markers; increment labels so that background=1.\n11. Mark unknown pixels with label 0 in the marker array.\n12. Apply cv2.watershed on the original color image using the prepared markers. The watershed algorithm labels boundaries with –1 and separates touching objects.\n13.
