Load task prompt from LLM_prompt.txt.

Collect optional input images from the images/ folder.

Send prompt (+ images) to OpenAI API with model (e.g., gpt-4o).

Expect structured response matching Response_structure with reasoning + solution_code.

Save and run solution_code from the response in a temp Python file.

Call segment_image() and get its predicted binary mask.

Load ground truth mask from images/ground_truth_mask.png.

Compute IoU between prediction and ground truth.

Pass if IoU â‰¥ 0.80. The score is simply the IoU * 100.
