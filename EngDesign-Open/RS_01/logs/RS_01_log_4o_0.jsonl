The track data consists of segments with lengths and curvatures, while the setup data provides car parameters.\n\n### Task 1: Compute Maximum Possible Speed\n1. **Understanding Curvature and Speed:**\n   - Curvature (1/radius) affects the maximum speed a car can achieve. On straights (curvature = 0), the car can reach its maximum speed limited by engine power and drag.\n   - On curves, the speed is limited by the lateral grip of the tires and the downforce.\n\n2. **Calculate Maximum Speed on Straights:**\n   - Use the engine power and drag to calculate the top speed on straights.\n   - The drag force is given by: \\( F_{drag} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{cx} \\times \\text{rho} \\times A \\times v^2 \\)\n   - The power available is \\( P = F_{drag} \\times v \\)\n   - Solve for maximum speed \\( v \\) using the engine power curve.\n\n3. **Calculate Maximum Speed on Curves:**\n   - The lateral force is given by: \\( F_{lateral} = m \\times v^2 / r \\)\n   - The maximum lateral force is limited by tire grip and downforce: \\( F_{max} = \\text{gripy} \\times (m \\times g + \\text{clt} \\times \\text{downforce}) \\)\n   - Solve for maximum speed \\( v \\) on curves.\n\n4. **Determine Overall Maximum Speed:**\n   - Compare speeds on straights and curves to find the maximum possible speed anywhere on the lap.\n\n### Task 2: Compute Minimum Possible Lap Time\n1. **Calculate Time for Each Segment:**\n   - For each segment, calculate the time taken using the speed determined from Task 1.\n   - Time for a segment is \\( t = \\frac{\\text{length}}{v} \\)\n\n2. **Sum Times for All Segments:**\n   - Sum the times for all segments to get the total lap time.\n\n3. **Convert to Required Units:**\n   - Convert the maximum speed to km/hr and the lap time to seconds.\n\nBy following these steps, we can compute the maximum speed and minimum lap time for the car on the given track.', config=ConfigFile(vcarmax=320.0, laptime=85.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'laptime_sol': np.float64(121.054), 'vcarmax_sol': np.float64(82.379), 'Lap_time_differnce': np.float64(36.054), 'Top_speed_difference': np.float64(-237.62099999999998)}, 'score': 0}
