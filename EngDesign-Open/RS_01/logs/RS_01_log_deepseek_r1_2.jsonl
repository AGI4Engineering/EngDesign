Using the highest gear ratio (4.0) and engine RPM (10000), the theoretical speed is (10000 * 2π * 0.32) / (4.0 * 60) ≈ 83.78 m/s ≈ 302 km/h. Task 2: Minimum lap time is estimated by summing segment times, each calculated as 10m divided by the minimum of top speed or cornering speed (sqrt(1.4*9.81/curvature)). Given the track length of 6960m and high-curvature segments, the lap time is approximated considering significant slowdowns in corners.", config=ConfigFile(vcarmax=302.0, laptime=120.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'laptime_sol': np.float64(121.054), 'vcarmax_sol': np.float64(82.379), 'Lap_time_differnce': np.float64(1.054000000000002), 'Top_speed_difference': np.float64(-219.62099999999998)}, 'score': 0}
