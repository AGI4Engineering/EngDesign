A notch filter is ideal for removing a specific frequency while minimally affecting others. The design process involves determining the filter coefficients based on the resonant frequency and bandwidth requirements.\n\n1.  **Determine filter parameters:**\n    *   Sampling frequency (fs): 2000 Hz\n    *   Resonant frequency (f0): 120 Hz\n    *   Target attenuation at f0: > 40 dB\n    *   Passband ripple (within +/- 5Hz of f0): < 3 dB\n\n2.  **Notch Filter Transfer Function:**\n    A typical second-order notch filter has the following transfer function:\n\n    H(z) = (b0 + b1*z^-1 + b2*z^-2) / (a0 + a1*z^-1 + a2*z^-2)\n\n    For a notch filter, the numerator coefficients are often symmetric, and the denominator coefficients determine the bandwidth or sharpness of the notch.\n\n3.  **Coefficient Calculation:**\n    To achieve a narrow notch and significant attenuation, we'll use the following approach:\n\n    *   b0 = 1\n    *   b1 = -2 * cos(2 * pi * f0 / fs)\n    *   b2 = 1\n    *   a0 = 1\n    *   a1 = r * b1, where r controls the notch bandwidth (0 < r < 1)\n    *   a2 = r^2\n\n    'r' close to 1 results in a narrow notch.\n\n    Choosing r = 0.98 to achieve a narrow notch:\n    *   b1 = -2 * cos(2 * pi * 120 / 2000) = -2 * cos(0.377) ≈ -1.855\n    *   a1 = 0.98 * -1.855 ≈ -1.818\n    *   a2 = 0.98^2 = 0.9604\n\nTherefore, our filter coefficients are:\n    *   Numerator: [1, -1.855, 1]\n    *   Denominator: [1, -1.818, 0.9604]\n\n4.  **Filter Order:**\nThe filter is a second-order filter.", config=ConfigFile(order=2.0, coeffs_numerator=[1.0, -1.855, 1.0], coeffs_denominator=[1.0, -1.818, 0.9604])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'order': 2.0, 'numerator coefficients': [1.0, -1.855, 1.0], 'denominator coefficients': [1.0, -1.818, 0.9604], 'passband below target attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'passband above target attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'target frequency attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'order value reasonable': True, 'order and coefficient are properly related': True}, 'score': 40}
