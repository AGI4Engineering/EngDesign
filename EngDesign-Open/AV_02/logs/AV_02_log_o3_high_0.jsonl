{'completion_tokens': 11779, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1.  The sensor is sampled at Fs = 2000 Hz and suffers from a narrow resonance at F0 = 120 Hz.\n2.  A very common way to suppress a single tonal component while leaving neighbouring frequencies almost untouched is a second–order (bi-quad) IIR notch filter that places two zeros exactly at the offending frequency and two poles slightly inside the unit circle at the same angle.\n3.  For a bi-quad notch the transfer function is\n        H(z)= (1 − 2cos(ω0)z⁻¹ + z⁻²) / (1 − 2r·cos(ω0)z⁻¹ + r² z⁻²)\n    where ω0 = 2πF0/Fs and r ( < 1) controls the 3-dB bandwidth.\n4.  Compute ω0:\n        ω0 = 2π·120 / 2000 = 0.12π ≈ 0.376991118 rad.\n        cos(ω0) ≈ 0.929776486.\n5.  Choose r high enough to keep the notch narrow, but low enough to guarantee ≥40 dB rejection at 120 Hz while giving <3 dB attenuation 5 Hz away.  Sweeping r analytically shows r = 0.99 provides ≈ –1.4 dB at 115 Hz and 125 Hz and infinite rejection at 120 Hz (theoretical –∞ dB, i.e. ≫40 dB in practice).\n6.  Plug the numbers into the formula:\n        Numerator:  b0 = 1\n                    b1 = −2·cos(ω0) = −1.859552972\n                    b2 = 1\n        Denominator: a0 = 1\n                     a1 = −2r·cos(ω0) = −1.840957442\n                     a2 = r² = 0.9801\n7.  The resulting magnitude at ±5 Hz (115 Hz & 125 Hz) is |H| ≈ 0.848 (≈ –1.4 dB) – inside the ‘less than 3 dB’ requirement.  At exactly 120 Hz the zeros make |H| → 0, easily better than 40 dB attenuation.\n8.  The filter is therefore a 2-nd-order IIR notch with the following coefficients.', config=ConfigFile(order=2.0, coeffs_numerator=[1.0, -1.859552972, 1.0], coeffs_denominator=[1.0, -1.840957442, 0.9801])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'order': 2.0, 'numerator coefficients': [1.0, -1.859552972, 1.0], 'denominator coefficients': [1.0, -1.840957442, 0.9801], 'passband below target attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'passband above target attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'target frequency attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'order value reasonable': True, 'order and coefficient are properly related': True}, 'score': 100}
