{'completion_tokens': 544, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To meet the specifications, a second-order IIR notch filter is a suitable choice. The notch filter will have a center frequency at 120 Hz. The sampling rate is 2000 Hz. We need to calculate the coefficients for the numerator and denominator. \n\nFirst, normalize the center frequency: w0 = 2 * pi * f0 / fs = 2 * pi * 120 / 2000 = 0.37699\nWe require a sharp notch, so we will use a narrow bandwidth.  A bandwidth of about 5 Hz on either side of the notch frequency sounds reasonable based on the requirements (attenuation > 40 dB at 120Hz, and < 3 dB at 115 Hz and 125 Hz). A narrower bandwidth would provide more attenuation, but also more distortion near the notch frequency. The bandwidth is related to the pole radius r: r = 1 - pi * BW / fs, where BW is the bandwidth.  Setting BW = 10 Hz:\nr = 1 - pi * 10 / 2000 = 0.98436\n\nNow calculate the filter coefficients:\nb0 = 1\nb1 = -2 * cos(w0) = -2 * cos(0.37699) = -1.8547\nb2 = 1\na0 = 1\na1 = -2 * r * cos(w0) = -2 * 0.98436 * cos(0.37699) = -1.8256\na2 = r^2 = 0.98436^2 = 0.96896\n\nTherefore, the filter coefficients are approximately:\nNumerator: [1, -1.8547, 1]\nDenominator: [1, -1.8256, 0.96896]\n\nThe filter order is 2.', config=ConfigFile(order=2.0, coeffs_numerator=[1.0, -1.8547, 1.0], coeffs_denominator=[1.0, -1.8256, 0.96896])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'order': 2.0, 'numerator coefficients': [1.0, -1.8547, 1.0], 'denominator coefficients': [1.0, -1.8256, 0.96896], 'passband below target attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'passband above target attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'target frequency attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'order value reasonable': True, 'order and coefficient are properly related': True}, 'score': 40}
