Determine the normalized frequency for the resonant frequency (120Hz) given a sampling rate of 2000Hz. The normalized frequency is 120Hz / (2000Hz/2) = 0.12.\n2. Choose a notch filter design to strongly attenuate the resonant frequency. A second-order IIR notch filter is sufficient for this purpose.\n3. Set the notch frequency to 0.12 (normalized) and choose a bandwidth that ensures the attenuation is less than 3dB at Â±5Hz from the resonant frequency (115Hz and 125Hz).\n4. Calculate the filter coefficients for the notch filter. The transfer function of a second-order notch filter is given by H(z) = (b0 + b1*z^-1 + b2*z^-2) / (1 + a1*z^-1 + a2*z^-2).\n5. The coefficients are calculated to place zeros at the notch frequency and poles close to the zeros but inside the unit circle to ensure stability and the desired bandwidth.\n\nFinal coefficients are derived to meet the attenuation requirements: >40dB at 120Hz and <3dB at 115Hz and 125Hz.", config=ConfigFile(order=2.0, coeffs_numerator=[0.969531, -1.876887, 0.969531], coeffs_denominator=[1.0, -1.876887, 0.939062])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'order': 2.0, 'numerator coefficients': [0.969531, -1.876887, 0.969531], 'denominator coefficients': [1.0, -1.876887, 0.939062], 'passband below target attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'passband above target attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'target frequency attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'order value reasonable': True, 'order and coefficient are properly related': True}, 'score': 40}
