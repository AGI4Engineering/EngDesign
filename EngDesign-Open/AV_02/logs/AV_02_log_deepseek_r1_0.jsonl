{'completion_tokens': 7019, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To eliminate the 120Hz resonant frequency with the given constraints, a second-order IIR notch filter is designed. The notch filter places zeros at the resonant frequency to create deep attenuation and poles close to the zeros to ensure stability and control the bandwidth. The coefficients are calculated using the pole-zero placement method with a pole radius (r = 0.9937) to achieve a narrow 3dB bandwidth of ~4Hz, ensuring less than 3dB attenuation at 115Hz and 125Hz. The numerator coefficients [1, -1.8569, 1] create zeros at 120Hz, and the denominator coefficients [1, -1.8443, 0.9874] place poles inside the unit circle for stability.
