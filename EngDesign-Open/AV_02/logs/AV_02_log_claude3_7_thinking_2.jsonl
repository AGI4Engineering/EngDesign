{'completion_tokens': 13083, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design an IIR filter that eliminates a 120Hz resonant frequency while meeting the specified constraints, I'll design a notch filter with precise placement of zeros and poles. First, I calculated the normalized notch frequency: ω₀ = 2π × (120/2000) = 0.377 radians/sample. For a notch filter, I placed zeros exactly at the notch frequency on the unit circle, and poles at the same angle but slightly inside the unit circle. I calculated cos(ω₀) = 0.929. To meet the bandwidth requirement (less than 3dB attenuation at 115Hz and 125Hz), I calculated the parameter r = 0.969 based on the normalized bandwidth of 0.031 radians/sample. The filter coefficients were calculated as: b₀ = 1, b₁ = -1.858, b₂ = 1, a₁ = -1.799, a₂ = 0.939. This 2nd-order filter places a zero exactly at 120Hz, providing very high attenuation at the resonant frequency (well beyond 40dB), while ensuring the attenuation at 115Hz and 125Hz is less than 3dB.", config=ConfigFile(order=2.0, coeffs_numerator=[1.0, -1.858, 1.0], coeffs_denominator=[1.0, -1.799, 0.939])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'order': 2.0, 'numerator coefficients': [1.0, -1.858, 1.0], 'denominator coefficients': [1.0, -1.799, 0.939], 'passband below target attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'passband above target attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'target frequency attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'order value reasonable': True, 'order and coefficient are properly related': True}, 'score': 20}
