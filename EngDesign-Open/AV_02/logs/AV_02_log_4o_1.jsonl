{'completion_tokens': 592, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a digital IIR filter that eliminates a resonant frequency of 120Hz while meeting the specified constraints, we can use a notch filter (also known as a band-stop filter). The notch filter is ideal for attenuating a specific frequency while having minimal impact on other frequencies.\n\n### Step-by-Step Design Process:\n\n1. **Sampling Frequency and Normalized Frequency:**\n   - The sampling frequency (Fs) is 2000Hz.\n   - The resonant frequency to eliminate is 120Hz.\n   - Normalize the resonant frequency: \\( f_{norm} = \\frac{120}{2000/2} = 0.12 \\).\n\n2. **Filter Specifications:**\n   - The filter should attenuate 120Hz by more than 40dB.\n   - The filter should have less than 3dB attenuation at 115Hz and 125Hz.\n\n3. **Designing the Notch Filter:**\n   - A second-order IIR notch filter is typically sufficient for this task.\n   - The notch filter can be designed using the following transfer function:\n     \\[ H(z) = \\frac{b_0 + b_1 z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2}}{1 + a_1 z^{-1} + a_2 z^{-2}} \\]\n   - The coefficients can be calculated using the notch frequency and the desired bandwidth.\n\n4. **Calculating Coefficients:**\n   - The bandwidth (BW) is determined by the frequencies 5Hz below and above the resonant frequency (115Hz and 125Hz).\n   - The quality factor (Q) can be calculated as \\( Q = \\frac{f_{resonant}}{BW} \\).\n   - Using standard formulas for a notch filter, calculate the coefficients.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Verify the filter's frequency response to ensure it meets the attenuation requirements at 120Hz and minimal impact at 115Hz and 125Hz.\n\n### Final Filter Design:\n- **Order:** 2 (second-order filter)\n- **Numerator Coefficients:** [1, -2*cos(2*pi*0.12), 1]\n- **Denominator Coefficients:** [1, -2*r*cos(2*pi*0.12), r^2]\n  - Here, \\( r \\) is a parameter that determines the bandwidth and is slightly less than 1 to ensure the notch is narrow enough to meet the design constraints.", config=ConfigFile(order=2.0, coeffs_numerator=[1.0, -1.902113032590307, 1.0], coeffs_denominator=[1.0, -1.902113032590307, 0.9801])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'order': 2.0, 'numerator coefficients': [1.0, -1.902113032590307, 1.0], 'denominator coefficients': [1.0, -1.902113032590307, 0.9801], 'passband below target attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'passband above target attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'target frequency attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'order value reasonable': True, 'order and coefficient are properly related': True}, 'score': 40}
