Because we must completely suppress a single narrow frequency (120 Hz) while leaving the neighbouring spectrum almost untouched (≤ 3 dB change only 5 Hz away), a very narrow band-stop (notch) IIR filter is appropriate.  \n\n2.  Choose the mathematical form.  A classical second–order digital notch section fulfils these requirements with minimum complexity:\n   H(z)= (1−2cos(ω0)z⁻¹+z⁻²)/(1−2r cos(ω0)z⁻¹+r²z⁻²)  \n   – Zeros lie on the unit circle at the notch frequency (deep attenuation).  \n   – Poles lie at radius r<1 at the same angle; r controls the 3 dB bandwidth.  \n\n3.  Compute constant values.  \n   Sampling-rate Fs = 2000 Hz → normalised radian notch frequency ω0 = 2π·120/Fs = 0.376991118 rad.  \n   cos(ω0) ≈ 0.929776.  \n\n4.  Pick the pole radius r so that the −3 dB points are at 115 Hz and 125 Hz (±5 Hz).  Using the exact amplitude expression of the notch filter, solving |H(e^{jΔω})|² ≥ 0.5 at Δf = 5 Hz gives r ≥ 0.984.  A convenient, easy-to-quantise value satisfying this is r = 0.99.  With this choice the attenuation at 115 Hz and 125 Hz is ≈ −1.46 dB (within the ≤3 dB requirement) while the attenuation at 120 Hz is theoretically infinite and >40 dB in practice.\n\n5.  Derive the final coefficients.  \n   Numerator (zeros):\n       b0 = 1\n       b1 = −2cos(ω0)  = −1.85955297\n       b2 = 1\n   Denominator (poles):\n       a0 = 1\n       a1 = −2r cos(ω0) = −1.84095644\n       a2 = r²          = 0.9801\n\n6.
