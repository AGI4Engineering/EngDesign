{'completion_tokens': 805, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a digital IIR filter that eliminates a resonant frequency at 120Hz with specific constraints, I'll create a notch filter (band-stop filter).\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements:\n- Sampling rate = 2000Hz\n- Notch frequency = 120Hz\n- Strong attenuation at 120Hz (>40dB)\n- Minimal effect (<3dB attenuation) at 115Hz and 125Hz\n\nThis is a very narrow notch filter requirement, with only 5Hz transition bands on either side.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the normalized frequency\nNormalized frequency = target frequency / (sampling rate/2)\nNormalized notch frequency = 120Hz / (2000Hz/2) = 120/1000 = 0.12\n\nStep 2: Design a second-order IIR notch filter\nA second-order IIR filter should be sufficient for a narrow notch. The transfer function of a notch filter is:\n\nH(z) = (b0 + b1*z^(-1) + b2*z^(-2)) / (1 + a1*z^(-1) + a2*z^(-2))\n\nStep 3: Calculate the coefficients\nFor a notch filter, we can use these formulas:\n- r = radius of the poles (controls bandwidth, closer to 1 means narrower)\n- ω0 = 2π * normalized frequency\n\nGiven our narrow requirements (5Hz on either side), we need r to be very close to 1. I'll use r = 0.99 to start.\n\nω0 = 2π * 0.12 = 0.7539822368615503\n\nNumerator coefficients:\nb0 = 1\nb1 = -2*cos(ω0)\nb2 = 1\n\nDenominator coefficients:\na0 = 1 (always normalized to 1)\na1 = -2*r*cos(ω0)\na2 = r^2\n\nCalculating:\nb1 = -2*cos(0.7539822368615503) = -2*0.7289686274214116 = -1.4579372548428232\nb2 = 1\n\na1 = -2*0.99*0.7289686274214116 = -1.4433789351731974\na2 = 0.99^2 = 0.9801\n\nTherefore, the coefficients are:\nNumerator: [1, -1.4579372548428232, 1]\nDenominator: [1, -1.4433789351731974, 0.9801]\n\nThis is a second-order filter (order = 2), which should provide the desired notch characteristics. The filter will have a very sharp notch at 120Hz with minimal impact on frequencies at 115Hz and 125Hz.", config=ConfigFile(order=2.0, coeffs_numerator=[1.0, -1.457937254842823, 1.0], coeffs_denominator=[1.0, -1.4433789351731974, 0.9801])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'order': 2.0, 'numerator coefficients': [1.0, -1.457937254842823, 1.0], 'denominator coefficients': [1.0, -1.4433789351731974, 0.9801], 'passband below target attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'passband above target attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'target frequency attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'order value reasonable': True, 'order and coefficient are properly related': True}, 'score': 40}
