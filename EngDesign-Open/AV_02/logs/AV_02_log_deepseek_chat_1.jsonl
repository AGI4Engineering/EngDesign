{'completion_tokens': 196, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To design an IIR filter that meets the specified requirements, we need to create a notch filter centered at 120Hz with sufficient attenuation at the resonant frequency while maintaining minimal attenuation at frequencies 5Hz away from the center. The sampling rate is 2000Hz. A second-order notch filter is typically sufficient for such requirements. The filter coefficients can be derived using standard digital filter design techniques, ensuring the notch is at 120Hz and the bandwidth is narrow enough to meet the attenuation specifications at 115Hz and 125Hz. The coefficients are calculated to place poles and zeros appropriately in the z-plane to achieve the desired frequency response.', config=ConfigFile(order=2.0, coeffs_numerator=[1.0, -1.618, 1.0], coeffs_denominator=[1.0, -1.516, 0.878])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'order': 2.0, 'numerator coefficients': [1.0, -1.618, 1.0], 'denominator coefficients': [1.0, -1.516, 0.878], 'passband below target attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'passband above target attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'target frequency attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'order value reasonable': True, 'order and coefficient are properly related': True}, 'score': 40}
