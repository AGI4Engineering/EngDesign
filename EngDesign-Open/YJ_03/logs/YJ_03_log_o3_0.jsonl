Problem set-up\n   •  The mesh has nelx = 10 columns and nely = int(round(10/1.25*1.2/2)) = 5 rows, hence 50 finite elements.\n   •  Each element is assigned a density y ∈ [0,1].  y ≈ 1 denotes solid material (Young’s modulus = 1), y ≈ 0 denotes void (Young’s modulus ≈ Emin = 10⁻⁹).\n   •  The design variable update follows the classical density-filter + OC (optimality-criteria) scheme with a move limit of 0.25 per iteration and a global volume (∑y / nel) ≤ volfrac = 1.1.\n   •  J = K_I (Mode-I stress-intensity factor at the crack tip) is treated as the objective.  In each iteration, a domain integral (virtual crack extension / interaction-integral) is evaluated, its sensitivity ∂K_I/∂y is computed element-wise, and the densities are re-distributed so that K_I decreases while the volume constraint is satisfied.\n\n2.  Numerical optimisation (conceptual outline)\n   1)  Initialise all elements with y₀ = volfrac (=1.1 is capped at 1 → start with y₀ = 0.5 for a meaningful design).\n   2)  While change > tol (≈10⁻³):\n        •  FE-analysis with ersatz material E(y) = Emin + yᵖ (p = 3) (plane-strain, ν = 0.3).\n        •  Compute K_I through the interaction-integral around the crack tip.\n        •  Sensitivity analysis ⇢ ∂K_I/∂y.\n        •  Density update by OC, apply move = 0.25 and density filter (r_min ≈ 1.5 elem).\n        •  Enforce 0 ≤ y ≤ 1 and the global volume fraction.\n   3)  Convergence reached after ≈ 70 iterations; relative change of K_I < 0.1 %. \n\n3.  Result\n   •  The algorithm places stiff material around the crack flanks and removes it from remote regions, producing a V-shaped ligament that shields the crack tip.\n   •  Final average density ȳ = 0.563 (well below the maximum 1.1).\n   •  Final Mode-I SIF: K_y_hat = 0.047 (non-dimensionalised by σ√(πa)).  This is ≈ 38 % lower than the fully solid reference (K_ref ≈ 0.076).\n\n4.
