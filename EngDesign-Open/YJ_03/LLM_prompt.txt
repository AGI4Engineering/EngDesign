## Task Description

This optimisation problem aims to minimise the Mode I stress-intensity factor (SIF) at the crack tip, thereby maximising fatigue-crack-propagation life and enhancing damage tolerance of the structural component. Material is selectively distributed within the design domain so that the resulting layout reduces the SIF while respecting a prescribed material-usage limit.

## Input Parameters

### Material properties
young       = 1        # Young’s modulus (normalised)
poisson     = 0.3      # Poisson’s ratio
ext_stiff   = 0.0      # Stiffness of surrounding “void” (external) material

### Constraints
Emin        = 1e-9     # Minimum ersatz stiffness for void elements
volfrac     = 1.1      # Maximum allowable volume fraction
move        = 0.25     # Maximum density change per iteration

### Mesh definition
nelx        = 10      # Number of finite-element columns (x-direction)
nely = int(np.round(nelx/1.25*1.2/2))
crack_length= 2       # Initial edge-crack length in elements

## Task
Use the input parameters to set up a topology optimization problem to minimize the stress-intensity factor. Your task is to:

- Simulate the optimization process.

- Ensure that the design adheres to the specified material properties, constraints, and mesh definitions.

- Output the final material distribution, y_hat, and report the minimal stress-intensity factor, named K_y_hat, obtained after convergence.

- y_hat must be a matrix where each element ranges from 0 to 1 inclusively.
