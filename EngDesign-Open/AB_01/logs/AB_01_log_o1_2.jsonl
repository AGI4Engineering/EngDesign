The sample variance (N−1 denominator) is 17.3333. The distribution is symmetric around the mean so skewness is 0.0000; the computed excess kurtosis (Fisher) is −1.0493.\n3) For the GLCM using horizontal adjacency on the interior, there are 12 pairs in total. Every pair of adjacent pixels differs by 3 in intensity, so the Contrast = 9.0000.\n', config=RadiomicsOutput(mean=37.5, variance=17.3333, skewness=0.0, kurtosis=-1.0493, contrast=9.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': 'Mean intensity value of the ROI is wrong.\nSample variance of intensity values in the ROI is wrong.\nSkewness of intensity distribution in the ROI is correct.\nExcess kurtosis of intensity distribution in the ROI is wrong.\nGLCM contrast feature computed from ROI pixels is correct.\n', 'score': 40}
