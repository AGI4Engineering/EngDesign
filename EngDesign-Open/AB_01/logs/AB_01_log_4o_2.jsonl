This forms a square with sides parallel to the axes.\n   - The interior pixels are those strictly inside this square, i.e., pixels with coordinates (r, c) where 3 <= r <= 6 and 3 <= c <= 6.\n\n2. **Extract Intensity Values:**\n   - From the given image patch, extract the intensity values of the identified interior pixels.\n\n3. **Calculate First-Order Statistics:**\n   - **Mean:** Average of the extracted intensity values.\n   - **Variance:** Sample variance of the intensity values.\n   - **Skewness:** Measure of asymmetry of the intensity distribution.\n   - **Kurtosis:** Measure of the "tailedness" of the intensity distribution, using excess kurtosis (subtract 3 from the result).\n\n4. **Construct GLCM:**\n   - Use horizontal adjacency (offset [0, 1]) to construct the GLCM for the interior pixels.\n   - Normalize the GLCM so that the sum of all its elements is 1.\n\n5. **Calculate GLCM Contrast:**\n   - Use the formula for contrast: $Contrast = \\sum_{i,j} |i-j|^2 p(i,j)$, where $p(i,j)$ is the normalized GLCM value.\n\nLet\'s perform these calculations step by step.', config=RadiomicsOutput(mean=36.0, variance=8.0, skewness=0.0, kurtosis=-1.2, contrast=8.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': 'Mean intensity value of the ROI is wrong.\nSample variance of intensity values in the ROI is wrong.\nSkewness of intensity distribution in the ROI is correct.\nExcess kurtosis of intensity distribution in the ROI is wrong.\nGLCM contrast feature computed from ROI pixels is wrong.\n', 'score': 20}
