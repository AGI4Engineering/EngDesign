{'completion_tokens': 5454, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Determine the strictly interior pixels of the polygon with vertices (2,2),(2,7),(7,7),(7,2). Since the polygon is a square from rows 2–7 and cols 2–7, the integer coordinates strictly inside satisfy 2<row<7 and 2<col<7, i.e. rows 3–6 and cols 3–6. That yields 4×4=16 pixels.\n\n2. Extract their intensity values from the provided 10×10 patch.  The 16 values are:\n   Row3 cols3–6: 30,33,36,39\n   Row4 cols3–6: 32,35,38,41\n   Row5 cols3–6: 34,37,40,43\n   Row6 cols3–6: 36,39,42,45\n   Combined list: [30,33,36,39,32,35,38,41,34,37,40,43,36,39,42,45]\n\n3. Compute first-order statistics:  \n   • Mean = (sum of values)/16 = 600/16 = 37.5  \n   • Sample variance = Σ(xᵢ–37.5)²/(16–1) = 260/15 ≈ 17.3333  \n   • Deviations are perfectly symmetric, so skewness = 0.0000  \n   • Fourth central moment = (1/16)Σ(xᵢ–37.5)⁴ = 586.0625, and σ⁴ = (17.3333)² ≈ 300.4444.  Excess kurtosis = 586.0625/300.4444 – 3 ≈ –1.0493\n\n4. Build the normalized GLCM for horizontal neighbor offset (0,1). Each of the 4 rows inside has 3 horizontal pairs, total 12 pairs: (30→33),(33→36),(36→39),(32→35),(35→38),(38→41),(34→37),(37→40),(40→43),(36→39),(39→42),(42→45).  All differences |i–j| are 3. The normalized GLCM sums to 1, so Contrast = Σ|i–j|²·p(i,j) = 9·1 = 9.0000.', config=RadiomicsOutput(mean=37.5, variance=17.3333, skewness=0.0, kurtosis=-1.0493, contrast=9.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': 'Mean intensity value of the ROI is wrong.\nSample variance of intensity values in the ROI is wrong.\nSkewness of intensity distribution in the ROI is correct.\nExcess kurtosis of intensity distribution in the ROI is wrong.\nGLCM contrast feature computed from ROI pixels is correct.\n', 'score': 40}
