{'completion_tokens': 237, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="Okay, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to identify the pixels inside the ROI. The ROI is a rectangle defined by vertices (2,2), (2,7), (7,7), (7,2). This means the row indices will range from 2 to 7 (inclusive), and column indices will also range from 2 to 7 (inclusive). Once I have the pixel locations, I extract the intensity values from the given image patch. Then I will compute the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of these values. Finally, I will calculate the GLCM contrast from horizontal adjacencies with distance of 1 inside the ROI. The GLCM will be normalized and contrast will be computed based on the normalized GLCM.", config=RadiomicsOutput(mean=37.5, variance=81.25, skewness=0.0, kurtosis=-1.3429, contrast=0.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': 'Mean intensity value of the ROI is wrong.\nSample variance of intensity values in the ROI is wrong.\nSkewness of intensity distribution in the ROI is correct.\nExcess kurtosis of intensity distribution in the ROI is wrong.\nGLCM contrast feature computed from ROI pixels is wrong.\n', 'score': 20}
