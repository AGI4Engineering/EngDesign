{'completion_tokens': 378, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Interior Pixels:**\n   - The given polygon is defined by vertices (2,2), (2,7), (7,7), (7,2). This forms a square. We need to find all integer pixel coordinates strictly inside this square.\n   - The interior pixels will have row and column indices ranging from 3 to 6 (inclusive) because the vertices themselves are not included.\n\n2. **Extract Intensity Values:**\n   - Using the identified interior pixel coordinates, extract the corresponding intensity values from the given 10x10 matrix.\n\n3. **Calculate First-Order Statistics:**\n   - **Mean:** Average of the extracted intensity values.\n   - **Variance:** Sample variance of the intensity values.\n   - **Skewness:** Measure of the asymmetry of the intensity distribution.\n   - **Kurtosis:** Measure of the "tailedness" of the intensity distribution, using Fisher\'s definition (excess kurtosis).\n\n4. **Construct GLCM:**\n   - Use horizontal adjacency (offset [0, 1]) to construct the GLCM for the interior pixels.\n   - Normalize the GLCM so that the sum of all its elements is 1.\n\n5. **Calculate GLCM Contrast:**\n   - Use the formula $Contrast = \\sum_{i,j} |i-j|^2 p(i,j)$ to calculate the contrast from the normalized GLCM.\n\nLet\'s perform these calculations step by step.', config=RadiomicsOutput(mean=39.0, variance=30.0, skewness=0.0, kurtosis=-1.2, contrast=0.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': 'Mean intensity value of the ROI is wrong.\nSample variance of intensity values in the ROI is wrong.\nSkewness of intensity distribution in the ROI is correct.\nExcess kurtosis of intensity distribution in the ROI is wrong.\nGLCM contrast feature computed from ROI pixels is wrong.\n', 'score': 20}
