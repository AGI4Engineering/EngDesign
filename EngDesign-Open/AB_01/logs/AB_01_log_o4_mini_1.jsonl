{'completion_tokens': 5673, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Step 1: Determine which pixels lie strictly inside the polygon\n\nThe polygon vertices are (2,2), (2,7), (7,7), (7,2), forming a 5×5 square from rows 2 to 7 and columns 2 to 7. "Strictly inside" excludes the boundary, so valid row indices are 3,4,5,6 and valid column indices are 3,4,5,6. That yields a 4×4 block of pixels (16 total).\n\nStep 2: Extract their intensities\n\nFrom the 10×10 image (0-based rows/cols), the values at (row,\u2009col):\nrows 3–6, cols 3–6 are:\n\nRow 3: 30, 33, 36, 39\nRow 4: 32, 35, 38, 41\nRow 5: 34, 37, 40, 43\nRow 6: 36, 39, 42, 45\n\nConcatenate: [30,33,36,39,32,35,38,41,34,37,40,43,36,39,42,45].\n\nStep 3: First-order statistics\n\n• Mean = sum/16 = 600/16 = 37.5\n• Sample variance = Σ(x–μ)²/(N–1) = 260/15 ≈ 17.3333\n• Skewness = Σ(x–μ)³ normalized. Because the deviations are symmetric around 0, Σ(x–μ)³=0 → skewness = 0.0000\n• Excess kurtosis (Fisher) using the unbiased formula yields ≈ –0.5994\n\nStep 4: GLCM with horizontal adjacency (offset [0,1])\n\nWithin the 4×4 block there are 3 horizontal neighbor pairs per row × 4 rows = 12 pairs:\n(30→33),(33→36),(36→39) in row 3;\n… similarly in rows 4–6.  All horizontal jumps are +3, so each |i–j|²=9.\n\nStep 5: Contrast = Σ|i–j|²\u2009p(i,j)\n\nEach of the 12 pairs has |i–j|²=9.  The normalized GLCM probability for each occurrence is count/12.  Hence Contrast = (12×9)/12 = 9.0000', config=RadiomicsOutput(mean=37.5, variance=17.3333, skewness=0.0, kurtosis=-0.5994, contrast=9.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': 'Mean intensity value of the ROI is wrong.\nSample variance of intensity values in the ROI is wrong.\nSkewness of intensity distribution in the ROI is correct.\nExcess kurtosis of intensity distribution in the ROI is correct.\nGLCM contrast feature computed from ROI pixels is correct.\n', 'score': 60}
