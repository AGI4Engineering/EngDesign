{'completion_tokens': 692, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The glider needs to travel 4000m horizontally while diving to 400m and returning to the surface, which means that it will dive for 2000m and climb for 2000m. Since the average glide speed is 1 m/s, the total dive/climb time is 2000 seconds for each direction. The total time must be less than 2 hours (7200 seconds), which means that we have 3200 seconds remaining for other operations. The total depth is 400m for the diving stage.  We need to find an angle, volume and mass that meet the requirement on distance, depth, time, energy and constraints on design parameters. Let's start by setting the volume to the middle of the range, 0.6 m³, and mass to 300kg. The angle will influence the depth and distance. Let's begin with a small angle, say 4 degrees, and iterate until a feasible value is obtained. Given that total distance is 2000 m and depth is 400m, sin(angle) = 400/2000 = 0.2 and hence angle is about 11.5 degree. If the angle is close to 11.5 the glider may not reach the final destination. So, let's pick a value, 5 degrees. Next, let's check energy consumption: P(z) = P₀ + l·m + k·z where P₀ = 100 W, l = 0.05 W/kg, k = 0.2 W/m. The depth changes linearly from 0 to 400 and then from 400 to 0 during the climb. We can consider the average power and average depth. The average depth is 200m, average mass is 300kg.  Average power P = 100 + 0.05 * 300 + 0.2 * 200 = 100 + 15 + 40 = 155 W. The total diving and climbing time is 4000s. The energy is given by E = P * t = 155 W * 4000 s = 620000 J = 620000/3600 Wh = 172.2 Wh. This is below 200Wh so the parameters we choose satisfy this constraint. The glider must float without water inside it. This is satisfied if rho_vehicle < rho_water or m/v < rho_water. With m = 300kg and V = 0.6 m^3, the density is 300/0.6 = 500 < 1025, which means the glider can float.  All constraints are satisfied so we can use the values of angle, volume and mass.", config=ConfigFile(angle=5.0, volume=0.6, mass=300.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'horizontal_distance_m': 9144.041842209073, 'time_seconds': 9178.970596535884, 'energy_required_Wh': 395.10368989977803, 'volume_m3': 0.6, 'density_kg_per_m3': 500.0, 'passed': False}, 'score': 60}
