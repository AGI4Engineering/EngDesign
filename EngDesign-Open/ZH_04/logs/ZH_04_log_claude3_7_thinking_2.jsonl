{'completion_tokens': 10098, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="I need to design an underwater glider that meets all the specified constraints.\n\n1. First, I'll determine the glide angle:\n   - The glider must follow a V-shape path diving to 400m depth and covering at least 4000m horizontally\n   - For a V-shape path with 400m depth each way, the minimum glide angle can be calculated as:\n     tan(θ) = 400m / (4000m/2) = 400m / 2000m = 0.2\n     θ = arctan(0.2) ≈ 11.3 degrees\n   - With this angle, the total path length would be: 2 × 400m / sin(11.3°) ≈ 4082m\n   - At a constant speed of 1 m/s, this would take 4082 seconds (68 minutes), well within the 2-hour limit\n\n2. For the vehicle volume, I'll choose V = 0.6 m³, which is within the specified range of 0.2-1 m³\n\n3. For the mass, I need to consider:\n   - The vehicle must float when empty (without ballast water), so its density must be less than water density (1025 kg/m³)\n   - For a volume of 0.6 m³, this means the vehicle mass should be less than 0.6 × 1025 = 615 kg\n   - I'll choose a mass of 300 kg to ensure good buoyancy control\n\n4. Energy calculation:\n   - Average depth over the path is approximately 133.33m (400m/3 for a triangular path)\n   - Power consumption: P(z) = P₀ + l·m + k·z = 100W + 0.05W/kg × 300kg + 0.2W/m × 133.33m = 141.67W\n   - Total energy: 141.67W × 4082s = 578,297 Ws = 160.64 Wh < 200 Wh battery capacity\n\nAll constraints are satisfied:\n- The V-shape path covers 4000m horizontally and 400m depth in 68 minutes (< 2 hours)\n- Energy consumption is 160.64 Wh (< 200 Wh)\n- Vehicle density is 300kg/0.6m³ = 500 kg/m³ (< 1025 kg/m³)\n- Volume is 0.6 m³ (within 0.2-1 m³)\n- Mass is 300 kg (> 200 kg minimum)", config=ConfigFile(angle=11.3, volume=0.6, mass=300.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'horizontal_distance_m': 4003.608899118445, 'time_seconds': 4082.7544889572296, 'energy_required_Wh': 175.73989878022564, 'volume_m3': 0.6, 'density_kg_per_m3': 500.0, 'passed': True}, 'score': 100}
