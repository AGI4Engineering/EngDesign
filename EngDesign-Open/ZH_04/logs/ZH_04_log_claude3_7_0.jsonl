Path constraint: V-shape path reaching 4000m horizontal distance, 400m depth, within 2 hours at 1 m/s\n\nFor a V-shaped path with maximum depth of 400m, we need to determine the glide angle that allows us to travel at least 4000m horizontally.\n\nFor a glide angle θ, the horizontal distance traveled to reach depth 400m is:\nHorizontal distance = 400m / tan(θ)\n\nSince we need a V-shaped path, the total horizontal distance is twice this value:\nTotal horizontal distance = 2 × 400m / tan(θ)\n\nThis must be at least 4000m:\n2 × 400m / tan(θ) ≥ 4000m\n800m / tan(θ) ≥ 4000m\ntan(θ) ≤ 800m / 4000m = 0.2\nθ ≤ arctan(0.2) ≈ 11.31 degrees\n\nThe time constraint states we must complete the journey in ≤ 2 hours = 7200 seconds.\n\nWith a constant glide speed of 1 m/s, the path length for a V-shaped path with depth 400m and glide angle θ is:\nPath length = 2 × 400m / sin(θ)\n\nThis path length divided by speed gives total time:\nTime = Path length / Speed = (2 × 400m / sin(θ)) / 1 m/s = 800m / sin(θ)\n\nFor the time constraint:\n800m / sin(θ) ≤ 7200s\nsin(θ) ≥ 800m / 7200s ≈ 0.111\nθ ≥ arcsin(0.111) ≈ 6.37 degrees\n\nSo our glide angle must be between 6.37° and 11.31°.\n\n2. Energy constraint: \nPower consumption is P(z) = P₀ + l·m + k·z = 100W + 0.05W/kg × m + 0.2W/m × z\n\nFor a V-shaped path, the average depth is 200m.\nAverage power = 100W + 0.05W/kg × m + 0.2W/m × 200m = 100W + 0.05W/kg × m + 40W\n\nTotal energy = Average power × Time\nTime = 800m / sin(θ) seconds\n\nSo energy = (100W + 0.05W/kg × m + 40W) × 800m / sin(θ)\n\nThis must not exceed battery capacity of 200Wh = 720,000 J.\n\n3. For the vehicle to float without water inside, its density must be less than water density:\nm/V < 1025 kg/m³\n\n4. Volume constraint: 0.2 m³ ≤ V ≤ 1 m³\n\n5. Mass constraint: m ≥ 200 kg\n\nLet's pick a reasonable glide angle in our allowed range, say θ = 10 degrees.\n\nFor θ = 10°:\n- Total horizontal distance = 2 × 400m / tan(10°) ≈ 4536m (meets 4000m requirement)\n- Time = 800m / sin(10°) ≈ 4596 seconds ≈ 1.28 hours (meets 2-hour limit)\n\nLet's choose V = 0.5 m³ (within the 0.2-1 m³ range).\n\nFor the mass, we need m ≥ 200 kg and m/V < 1025 kg/m³.\nWith V = 0.5 m³, the maximum mass would be m < 1025 × 0.5 = 512.5 kg.\nLet's choose m = 300 kg, which satisfies 200 kg ≤ m < 512.5 kg.\n\nNow, let's check the energy constraint:\nEnergy = (100W + 0.05W/kg × 300kg + 40W) × 4596s\n       = (100W + 15W + 40W) × 4596s\n       = 155W × 4596s\n       = 712,380 J = 197.9 Wh < 200 Wh\n\nAll constraints are satisfied with:\n- Glide angle θ = 10 degrees\n- Vehicle volume V = 0.5 m³\n- Vehicle mass m = 300 kg", config=ConfigFile(angle=10.0, volume=0.5, mass=300.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'horizontal_distance_m': 4537.025455694167, 'time_seconds': 4607.016386514907, 'energy_required_Wh': 198.3064609039861, 'volume_m3': 0.5, 'density_kg_per_m3': 600.0, 'passed': True}, 'score': 100}
