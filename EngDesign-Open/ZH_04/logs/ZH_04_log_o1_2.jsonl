{'completion_tokens': 4964, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='We first used the terrain (depth=400m) and time (up to 2 hours) requirements to constrain the glide angle. For a constant speed of 1 m/s and a V-shaped path (surface to 400m and back again), the total path distance is 2×400/sin(θ). Requiring that this distance take no more than 2 hours at 1 m/s imposes sin(θ) ≥ 0.1111 (θ ≥ 6.38°). Meanwhile, to achieve at least 4000m of horizontal range across the dive and ascent, tan(θ) ≤ 0.2 (θ ≤ 11.31°). A choice of θ=10° satisfies both constraints comfortably.\n\nTo verify the battery-limit constraint (must not exceed 200 Wh = 720000 J), we integrated the power function P(z) = P₀ + l·m + k·z from z=0 down to z=400 and back to z=0. This simplifies to a total energy E(total) = (1/sin(θ)) [112000 + 40m]. With θ=10° (sin(10°)≈0.17365), E(total) ≤ 720000 J implies m ≤ about 326kg. Together with the requirement that the vehicle mass be at least 200kg but not exceed ρV (for ρ=1025kg/m³ and volume V between 0.2m³ and 1m³), we chose V=0.3m³ and m=300kg. This yields E(total)≈714kJ (≈198.4Wh), which is under 200Wh capacity. The chosen volume and mass also satisfy the density requirement (300/0.3=1000kg/m³ ≤1025kg/m³).', config=ConfigFile(angle=10.0, volume=0.3, mass=300.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'horizontal_distance_m': 4537.025455694167, 'time_seconds': 4607.016386514907, 'energy_required_Wh': 198.3064609039861, 'volume_m3': 0.3, 'density_kg_per_m3': 1000.0, 'passed': True}, 'score': 100}
