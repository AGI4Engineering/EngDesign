{'completion_tokens': 798, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The problem requires selecting the values of angle, volume, and mass for an underwater glider subject to a number of constraints. First, I will choose an initial feasible glide angle, ensuring it's between 0 and 90 degrees. Then, I will derive mass of the glider to satisfy total distance, depth, and time constraints. Finally, I will derive vehicle volume to meet buoyancy and other constraints, using the chosen values. The goal is to meet mission goals within the specified performance constraints.\n\n1. **Glide Angle Selection:**  Given the constraints, I'll choose a shallow glide angle, for example, 10 degrees as a starting point. It should not be close to 0 to enable fast diving. It also should not be close to 90 to save energy during the process.\n\n2. **Total distance, depth, and time constraints**: I will choose mass to meet total distance, depth, and time constraints. The total diving depth is 400 m and the angle is 10 degrees.  The length of each diving/surfacing path is 400/sin(10*pi/180) = 2303 m. The total horizontal distance is 2*2303*cos(10*pi/180) = 4534 m. Since the speed is 1 m/s, the total traveling time is 4534 s, which is 1.26 hours. Then the time limit constraint is met.\n\n3. **Volume Selection:** The volume must satisfy buoyancy and size constraints. The volume must be at least m/rho, where rho is water density. In order for the vehicle to reach the required diving depth and be able to surface with buoyancy control, the mass cannot be too large. With the above constraints and volume limit, I will use 0.3 m^3 as the volume value. To determine the mass I need to use the mass equation.\n\n4. **Calculate the bouyancy:**\nBuoyancy is calculated as ρVg, where ρ = 1025 kg/m³ and g = 9.81 m/s².  So, Buoyancy = 1025 kg/m³ * 0.3 m³ * 9.81 m/s² = 3016 N.\n\n5. **Mass should meet floating condition requirement:** m < ρV = 1025*0.3 = 307.5 kg. Thus, I set the mass to 250 kg, which also meets mass lower bound constraint.\n\n6. **Energy consumption calculation**: The energy consumption constraints must be checked. The energy consumption is the time integral of power and the power consumption is depth related, P(z) = P₀ + l·m + k·z.\nThe average depth is 400 / 2 = 200 meters for each diving or surfacing path.\nP(z) = 100 + 0.05*250 + 0.2*200 = 100 + 12.5 + 40 = 152.5 W.\nThe total gliding time is 4534 seconds, or 1.26 hours.  The total energy consumption is 152.5 * 1.26 = 192.2 Wh. This meets the requirement.\n\nAll constraints are met.", config=ConfigFile(angle=10.0, volume=0.3, mass=250.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'horizontal_distance_m': 4537.025455694167, 'time_seconds': 4607.016386514907, 'energy_required_Wh': 195.10714396890629, 'volume_m3': 0.3, 'density_kg_per_m3': 833.3333333333334, 'passed': True}, 'score': 100}
