{'completion_tokens': 6294, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='First, using the requirement that the total horizontal distance must be at least 4000 m while diving to 400 m and returning to the surface in under 2 hours at an average speed of 1 m/s, we derive constraints on the allowable glide angle θ. For a single leg, if the vertical drop is 400 m, the horizontal distance per leg is 400/tan(θ), and the total horizontal distance over the round trip is 800/tan(θ). We require 800/tan(θ) ≥ 4000, giving tan(θ) ≤ 0.2, or θ ≤ about 11.3°. Also, the total path distance covered by the glider in both legs is 800/sin(θ); it must be traveled in under 2 hours at 1 m/s. Hence 800/sin(θ) ≤ 7200, or sin(θ) ≥ 1/9 (θ ≥ about 6.38°). A choice of θ = 10° is within these limits.\n\nNext, the power consumption is P(z) = 100 W + (0.05 W/kg)·m + (0.2 W/m)·z, where m is the total vehicle mass. Over the dive from z = 0 to z = 400 m (and similarly during ascent from 400 m back to the surface), we calculate the average power by taking the integral of P(z) from z = 0 to 400 and dividing by 400. For m = 300 kg, the constant term 0.05·m is 15 W, so P(z) = 100 + 15 + 0.2z = 115 + 0.2z. The average of 115 + 0.2z over z from 0 to 400 is 155 W. The total time for the full V-shape trip is 800/sin(10°) ≈ 4607 s (~1.28 hours). Thus the total energy is 155 W × 4607 s ≈ 715 kJ, or about 198.6 Wh, staying under the 200 Wh limit.\n\nTo satisfy the density constraint, m / V must be ≤ 1025 kg/m³. With m = 300 kg and V = 0.4 m³, the density is 300/0.4 = 750 kg/m³, which is under 1025 kg/m³. Also, V is within the 0.2–1 m³ range, and m ≥ 200 kg. These choices meet all requirements.\n', config=ConfigFile(angle=10.0, volume=0.4, mass=300.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'horizontal_distance_m': 4537.025455694167, 'time_seconds': 4607.016386514907, 'energy_required_Wh': 198.3064609039861, 'volume_m3': 0.4, 'density_kg_per_m3': 750.0, 'passed': True}, 'score': 100}
