## Rubric for Evaluating NPU Chip Design and Allocation
- Task 1 correct: 10
- Task 2:
    - If the answer is with +-10% of the reference answer: 10
    - Otherwise: 0
- Task 3:
    - Prefill score:
        - If the answer violates latency SLO or memory constraint or is an invalid allocation: 0
        - If the answer satisfies latency SLO: score = answer_throughput / ideal_throughput * 40
    - Decode score:
        - If the answer violates latency SLO or memory constraint or is an invalid allocation: 0
        - If the answer satisfies latency SLO: score = answer_throughput / ideal_throughput * 40
