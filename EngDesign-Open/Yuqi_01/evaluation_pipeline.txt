A utility script will automatically evaluate each task.

For Task 1, the answer will be directly compared with the solution.

For Task 2, the answer will be compared with the solution with a tolerance of +-10%.

For Task 3, the script will look up all possible NPU allocation plans from JSON files.
The script will first check if the answer is valid (i.e., if it satisfies the latency SLO and memory constraint, and do not exceed the number of chips).
Then, the script will compare the throughput of the answer with the ideal throughput.
If the answer is valid, the score will be calculated as answer_throughput / ideal_throughput * 40 for prefill/decode.
The total score will be the sum of the prefill score and decode score.
