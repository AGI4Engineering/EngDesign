These typically include the engine torque (EngNm), engine RPM (EngRpm), car mass (mcar), and the effective radius of the tire (reff).\n2. **Calculate Force**: The force exerted by the engine can be calculated using the formula: \n   \\[ F = \\frac{Torque \\times Gear Ratio}{Effective Radius} \\]\n   where Torque is the engine torque, Gear Ratio is the ratio of the gear in use, and Effective Radius is the radius of the tire.\n3. **Calculate Acceleration**: Using Newton's second law, the acceleration can be calculated as:\n   \\[ a = \\frac{F}{m} \\]\n   where F is the force calculated above and m is the mass of the car.\n\n### Task 2: Maximum Possible Deceleration\n1. **Identify Parameters**: For deceleration, we need to consider the braking force, which is influenced by the braking system's efficiency (mbrk) and the grip of the tires (gripx).\n2. **Calculate Braking Force**: The maximum braking force can be calculated using:\n   \\[ F_{brake} = mbrk \\times gripx \\times mcar \\times g \\]\n   where g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/sÂ²).\n3. **Calculate Deceleration**: The deceleration can be calculated as:\n   \\[ a_{dec} = \\frac{F_{brake}}{mcar} \\]\n\nBy following these steps, we can compute the maximum acceleration and deceleration of the car.", config=ConfigFile(max_acc=15.0, max_dec=9.81)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Max_acceleration_differnce': -3.214644388639334, 'Max_deceleration_difference': 21.786638164170874}, 'score': 0}
