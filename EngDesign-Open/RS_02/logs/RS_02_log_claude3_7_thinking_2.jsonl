Engine power limitation:\n   Wheel torque = Engine torque × Gear ratio × Drivetrain efficiency\n   Wheel torque = 430 Nm × 10.0 × 0.95 = 4,085 Nm\n   \n   Force at wheels = Wheel torque / Tire radius\n   Force at wheels = 4,085 Nm / 0.32 m = 12,765.6 N\n   \n   Maximum engine-limited acceleration = Force / Mass\n   Maximum engine-limited acceleration = 12,765.6 N / 728 kg = 17.53 m/s²\n\n2. Tire grip limitation:\n   Maximum grip force = Mass × Gravity × Grip coefficient\n   Maximum grip force = 728 kg × 9.81 m/s² × 1.15 = 8,214.7 N\n   \n   Maximum grip-limited acceleration = Grip force / Mass\n   Maximum grip-limited acceleration = 8,214.7 N / 728 kg = 11.28 m/s²\n\nSince the grip-limited acceleration (11.28 m/s²) is lower than the engine-limited acceleration (17.53 m/s²), the maximum acceleration is limited by tire grip to 11.28 m/s².\n\nFor deceleration under braking, assuming mbrk represents maximum braking torque:\n\nBraking force at wheels = Braking torque / Tire radius\nBraking force at wheels = 7000 Nm / 0.32 m = 21,875 N\n\nMaximum brake-limited deceleration = Braking force / Mass\nMaximum brake-limited deceleration = 21,875 N / 728 kg = 30.05 m/s²\n\nComparing with the grip limit (11.28 m/s²), the maximum deceleration is also limited by tire grip to 11.28 m/s². The brakes are powerful enough to lock the wheels, but the car can't decelerate faster than what the tire grip allows.\n\nTherefore, both the maximum acceleration and deceleration of the car are 11.28 m/s², limited by the tire grip coefficient of 1.15.", config=ConfigFile(max_acc=11.28, max_dec=11.28)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Max_acceleration_differnce': 0.5053556113606668, 'Max_deceleration_difference': 20.316638164170875}, 'score': 0}
