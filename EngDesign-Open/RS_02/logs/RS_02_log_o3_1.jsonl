The limiting force is therefore the tyre friction limit:\n      F_max = μ · m · g\n             = 1.15 · 728 kg · 9.81 m/s²\n             = 8 213 N (rounded)\n  Corresponding acceleration:\n      a_max = F_max / m\n             = (μ · m · g) / m = μ · g\n             = 1.15 · 9.81 ≈ 11.2815 m/s²\n\nStep-3  Maximum possible deceleration under braking\n  (a) Compute the theoretical brake-limited wheel force\n      F_brk = (M_brk · η) / r_tyre\n             = (7000 N·m · 0.95) / 0.32 m ≈ 20 780 N\n  (b) Compare with the friction limit calculated in Step-2 (8 213 N).  Because 20 780 N > 8 213 N, the tyres saturate first and the deceleration is again tyre-limited:\n      a_dec_max = μ · g ≈ 11.2815 m/s²\n\nStep-4  Summarise\n  • Maximum acceleration  ≈ 11.28 m/s²\n  • Maximum deceleration  ≈ 11.28 m/s²\n\n(Down-force, aerodynamic drag and weight-transfer effects are disregarded because they are either negligible at the instant of peak values or insufficiently defined by the given data.
