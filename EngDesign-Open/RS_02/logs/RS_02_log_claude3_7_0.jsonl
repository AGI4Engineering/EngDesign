From rGearRat [10.0,7.8,6.1,7.8,5.2,4.5,4.0], the highest ratio is 10.0 (first gear).\n\nMaximum tractive force = (Max torque × Gear ratio × Final drive ratio × Transmission efficiency) / Tire radius\nMaximum tractive force = (430 Nm × 10.0 × 1.0 × 0.95) / 0.32 m = 12,765.6 N\n\nStep 3: Calculate maximum acceleration\na_max = Maximum tractive force / Car mass\na_max = 12,765.6 N / 728 kg = 17.5 m/s²\n\n### Task 2: Maximum Possible Deceleration\n\nFor maximum deceleration, I need to consider the braking capability:\n\nGiven parameters:\n- Braking torque (mbrk) = 7000 Nm\n- Tire radius (rtyre) = 0.32 m\n- Car mass (mcar) = 728 kg\n\nStep 1: Calculate maximum braking force\nMaximum braking force = Braking torque / Tire radius\nMaximum braking force = 7000 Nm / 0.32 m = 21,875 N\n\nStep 2: Calculate maximum deceleration\na_dec = Maximum braking force / Car mass\na_dec = 21,875 N / 728 kg = 30.0 m/s²\n\nTherefore, the maximum acceleration is approximately 17.5 m/s² and the maximum deceleration is approximately 30.0 m/s².", config=ConfigFile(max_acc=17.5, max_dec=30.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Max_acceleration_differnce': -5.714644388639334, 'Max_deceleration_difference': 1.596638164170873}, 'score': 0}
