The centripetal force is given by the formula:\n\nF = m * a\n\nwhere:\n- F is the force (in Newtons)\n- m is the mass (in kilograms)\n- a is the centripetal acceleration (in meters per second squared)\n\nThe centripetal acceleration can be calculated using the formula:\n\na = v^2 / r\n\nwhere:\n- v is the velocity of the car (in meters per second)\n- r is the radius of the turn (in meters)\n\nHowever, the problem does not provide direct values for velocity or radius. Instead, we can use the lateral grip coefficient (gripx) to estimate the maximum lateral acceleration the car can achieve without losing traction. The lateral acceleration can be approximated as:\n\na = gripx * g\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2).\n\nThe total mass of the head and helmet is:\n\nm = 5 kg (head) + 2 kg (helmet) = 7 kg\n\nThus, the maximum force on the neck is:\n\nF = m * a = 7 kg * gripx * 9.81 m/s^2\n\nThis will give us the force in Newtons.", config=ConfigFile(force_on_neck=68.67)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'corner_acceleration_differnce': 150.3250524826334}, 'score': 0}
