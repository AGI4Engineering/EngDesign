First, I'll identify the relevant parameters from the SetupFile.json:\n   - `mcar` = 728 kg (mass of the car)\n   - `gripx` = 1.15 (longitudinal grip coefficient)\n   - `gripy` = 1.40 (lateral grip coefficient)\n\n2. Given information about the driver:\n   - Mass of the head = 5 kg\n   - Mass of the helmet = 2 kg\n   - Total mass of head + helmet = 7 kg\n\n3. The maximum lateral acceleration the car can achieve is limited by the lateral grip coefficient:\n   - Maximum lateral acceleration = gripy * g (where g is the gravitational acceleration, 9.81 m/s²)\n   - Maximum lateral acceleration = 1.40 * 9.81 = 13.734 m/s²\n\n4. The force on the neck is the product of the mass of the head+helmet and the maximum lateral acceleration:\n   - Force = mass * acceleration\n   - Force = 7 kg * 13.734 m/s² = 96.138 N\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible load on the neck of the driver when cornering is approximately 96.138 Newtons.", config=ConfigFile(force_on_neck=96.14)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'corner_acceleration_differnce': 122.85505248263341}, 'score': 0}
