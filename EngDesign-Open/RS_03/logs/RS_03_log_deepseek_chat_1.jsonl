This force is a result of the car's lateral acceleration.\n\n2. **Calculate the total mass of the head and helmet**: \n   - Mass of the head (m_head) = 5 kg\n   - Mass of the helmet (m_helmet) = 2 kg\n   - Total mass (m_total) = m_head + m_helmet = 5 + 2 = 7 kg\n\n3. **Determine the lateral acceleration (a_lat)**: \n   - The lateral acceleration can be derived from the car's grip in the y-direction (gripy), which is given as 1.40. This is a multiplier for the acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.81 m/s²).\n   - a_lat = gripy * g = 1.40 * 9.81 ≈ 13.734 m/s²\n\n4. **Compute the lateral force (F_lat)**: \n   - F_lat = m_total * a_lat = 7 * 13.734 ≈ 96.138 N\n\n5. **Result**: The maximum possible load on the neck is the lateral force, which is approximately 96.138 N.", config=ConfigFile(force_on_neck=96.138)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'corner_acceleration_differnce': 122.8570524826334}, 'score': 0}
