Without considering downforce, the maximum lateral acceleration would be:\n   a_lat = gripy × g = 1.40 × 9.81 = 13.734 m/s²\n\n2. However, at high speeds, the downforce increases the effective grip. The loadEff parameter (0.10) indicates how much the grip increases with additional load. For a race car at high speeds, we can reasonably assume that the downforce becomes significant compared to the car's weight.\n   Effective gripy = gripy × (1 + loadEff) = 1.40 × (1 + 0.10) = 1.54\n\n3. The maximum lateral acceleration with downforce effect is:\n   a_lat_max = Effective gripy × g = 1.54 × 9.81 = 15.11 m/s²\n\n4. The force on the neck is the product of mass and acceleration:\n   F_neck = (mass of head + mass of helmet) × a_lat_max\n   F_neck = (5 kg + 2 kg) × 15.11 m/s² = 7 kg × 15.11 m/s² = 105.77 N\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible load on the neck of the driver when cornering is approximately 105.77 N.", config=ConfigFile(force_on_neck=105.77)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'corner_acceleration_differnce': 113.22505248263342}, 'score': 0}
