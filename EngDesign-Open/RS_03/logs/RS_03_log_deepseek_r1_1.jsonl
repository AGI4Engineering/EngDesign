The lateral acceleration during cornering is determined by the car's lateral grip coefficient ('gripy' in SetupFile.json), which is 1.40. This coefficient represents multiples of gravitational acceleration (g = 9.81 m/s²). The maximum lateral acceleration is therefore gripy * g = 1.40 * 9.81 ≈ 13.734 m/s².
