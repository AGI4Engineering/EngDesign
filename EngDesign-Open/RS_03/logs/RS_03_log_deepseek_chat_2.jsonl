{'completion_tokens': 235, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To compute the maximum possible load on the neck of the driver when the car is cornering, we need to consider the lateral force acting on the head and helmet due to cornering. The lateral force (F) can be calculated using the formula F = m * a, where m is the mass of the head and helmet, and a is the lateral acceleration. The lateral acceleration can be derived from the gripy parameter, which represents the lateral grip capability of the car in g-forces. Since 1 g is approximately 9.81 m/s², the lateral acceleration (a) is gripy * 9.81 m/s². The total mass (m) is the sum of the head mass (5 kg) and helmet mass (2 kg), which is 7 kg. Therefore, the maximum force on the neck is F = 7 kg * (1.40 * 9.81 m/s²) = 7 * 13.734 = 96.138 N.', config=ConfigFile(force_on_neck=96.138)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'corner_acceleration_differnce': 122.8570524826334}, 'score': 0}
