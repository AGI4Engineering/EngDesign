{'completion_tokens': 1050, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. From SetupFile.json, the lateral grip coefficient (grippy) is 1.40.\n2. The maximum lateral acceleration a_lat that the car can generate is given by a_lat = μ ⋅ g, where μ = grippy and g = 9.81 m/s². Thus a_lat = 1.40 ⋅ 9.81 ≈ 13.734 m/s².\n3. The combined mass of the head and helmet is m = 5 kg + 2 kg = 7 kg.\n4. The lateral force on the neck is F = m ⋅ a_lat = 7 kg ⋅ 13.734 m/s² ≈ 96.14 N.  \n\nTherefore, the maximum load on the driver’s neck during cornering is approximately 96.14 N.', config=ConfigFile(force_on_neck=96.14)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'corner_acceleration_differnce': 122.85505248263341}, 'score': 0}
