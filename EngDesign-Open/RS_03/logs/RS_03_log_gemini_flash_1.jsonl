{'completion_tokens': 330, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. **Identify relevant parameters:**  The car setup file provides `gripx` (lateral grip) and `gripy` (longitudinal grip), which are crucial for determining the maximum possible acceleration. The task specifies the mass of the head (5 kg) and helmet (2 kg), which are needed to calculate the force on the neck. The total mass is head_mass + helmet_mass = 5kg + 2kg = 7kg\n\n2. **Calculate maximum lateral acceleration:** The lateral grip (`gripx`) represents the maximum lateral acceleration the car can achieve, expressed as a multiple of gravitational acceleration (g ≈ 9.81 m/s²). Therefore, the maximum lateral acceleration is `gripx * g = 1.15 * 9.81 = 11.2815 m/s²`.\n\n3. **Calculate the force on the neck:** The force on the neck is equal to the mass of the head and helmet multiplied by the lateral acceleration. Therefore, Force = `(head_mass + helmet_mass) * lateral_acceleration = 7kg * 11.2815 m/s² = 78.9705 N`\n\n4. **Rounding the answer:** The resulting force is rounded to two decimal places which leads to a final answer of 78.97 N.', config=ConfigFile(force_on_neck=78.97)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'corner_acceleration_differnce': 140.0250524826334}, 'score': 0}
