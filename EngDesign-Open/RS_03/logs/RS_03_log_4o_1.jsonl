{'completion_tokens': 326, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To compute the maximum possible load on the neck of the driver when the car is cornering, we need to determine the lateral acceleration experienced by the car during cornering. This lateral acceleration can be calculated using the formula for centripetal acceleration, which is a = v^2 / r, where v is the velocity of the car and r is the radius of the turn. However, since we don't have direct information about the velocity or the radius of the turn, we will use the grip coefficient (gripx) to estimate the lateral acceleration.\n\nThe grip coefficient (gripx) represents the maximum lateral force that can be exerted by the tires as a fraction of the car's weight. Therefore, the lateral acceleration (a_lat) can be approximated as:\n\na_lat = gripx * g\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2).\n\nOnce we have the lateral acceleration, the force on the neck can be calculated by considering the total mass of the head and helmet, which is 5 kg + 2 kg = 7 kg. The force (F_neck) is then given by:\n\nF_neck = mass_neck * a_lat\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nF_neck = 7 kg * gripx * 9.81 m/s^2\n\nThis will give us the force in Newtons (N) on the neck when the car is cornering.", config=ConfigFile(force_on_neck=68.67)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'corner_acceleration_differnce': 150.3250524826334}, 'score': 0}
