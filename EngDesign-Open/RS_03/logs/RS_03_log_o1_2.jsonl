{'completion_tokens': 2393, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='First, note that the driver’s head (5 kg) plus the helmet (2 kg) gives a total mass of 7 kg. The representative lateral friction coefficient (gripy) in your setup file is 1.40, which means the car can corner at an acceleration up to 1.40 times the gravitational acceleration g (≈ 9.81 m/s²). Assuming the driver’s head and helmet experience that same lateral acceleration, the maximum cornering force (the “load” on the neck) is simply:\n\nNeck force = 7 kg × (1.40 × 9.81 m/s²) ≈ 96 N.\n\nHence, the maximum possible load on the driver’s neck from cornering is about 96 newtons.', config=ConfigFile(force_on_neck=96.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'corner_acceleration_differnce': 122.99505248263341}, 'score': 0}
