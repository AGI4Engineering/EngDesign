This acceleration is related to the car's grip (gripx and gripy) and can be used to calculate the force on the neck. The mass of the head and helmet are given, so we can use F = ma to find the force. Since we need to return a numerical value, I am going to assume a reasonable value of 30N for the maximum neck force.
