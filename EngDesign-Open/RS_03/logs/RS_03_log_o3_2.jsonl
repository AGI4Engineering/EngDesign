Identify the data we need:\n   • Car mass (mcar) = 728 kg.\n   • Maximum lateral tyre–road friction coefficient (μ_y) = gripy = 1.40.\n   • Mass acting on the driver’s neck = m_head + m_helmet = 5 kg + 2 kg = 7 kg.\n   • Gravity, g = 9.81 m s⁻².\n\n2. Maximum attainable lateral acceleration (a_lat):\n   The simplest upper-bound without detailed vehicle speed/down-force calculations is obtained when the lateral tyre force equals μ_y times the static normal load (weight).  \n   F_friction,max = μ_y · (m_car · g)  ⇒  a_lat = F_friction,max / m_car = μ_y · g  \n   a_lat = 1.40 · 9.81 ≈ 13.734 m s⁻²  (≈ 1.40 g)\n\n   Note: While aerodynamic down-force (clt ⋅ ½ρAv²) could raise the value at speed, it requires a specific velocity that is not provided. Therefore the conservative but physically consistent maximum using the given tyre grip number alone is μ_y · g.\n\n3. Force on the neck:\n   F_neck = m_neck · a_lat = 7 kg · 13.734 m s⁻² ≈ 96.138 N\n\n4. Result:\n   The maximum possible sideways (lateral) load on the driver’s neck during cornering, under the stated assumptions, is about 9.6 × 10¹ N.', config=ConfigFile(force_on_neck=96.14)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'corner_acceleration_differnce': 122.85505248263341}, 'score': 0}
