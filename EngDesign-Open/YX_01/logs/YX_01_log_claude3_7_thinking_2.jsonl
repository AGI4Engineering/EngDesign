The Euclidean distance between start and goal positions is sqrt((32.5-(-15))² + (27.5-12)²) ≈ sqrt(2502.5) ≈ 50.02 meters\n2. This direct distance doesn't account for obstacles or nonholonomic constraints\n3. The vehicle needs to change orientation from π to π/2, requiring additional maneuvering\n4. With the minimum turning radius of 8 meters, the vehicle cannot make sharp turns\n\nConsidering the obstacle distribution in the costmap and the nonholonomic constraints, a reasonable path length would be approximately 85 meters. Based on the complexity of the path planning task, I estimate an absolute error of about 5 meters in this calculation.\n\n### Task 3: Hybrid A* Path Planning with New Start/Goal\nParameters:\n- Start pose: (30, -12, π)\n- Goal pose: (-26, 12, π/2)\n- Same motion constraints as Task 2\n\nTo estimate this path length:\n1. The Euclidean distance between start and goal positions is sqrt((30-(-26))² + (-12-12)²) ≈ sqrt(3712) ≈ 60.92 meters\n2. This path potentially encounters more obstacles, requiring more complex navigation\n3. The change in y-coordinate (from -12 to 12) is more significant than in Task 2, requiring additional maneuvers\n\nConsidering these factors, a reasonable path length would be approximately 115 meters. Due to the increased complexity, I estimate an absolute error of about 7 meters in this calculation.", config=ConfigFile(Bottom_left=(-80, -30), Bottom_right=(40, -30), Top_right=(40, 70), Top_left=(-80, 70), task2_length=85.0, tol2=5.0, task3_length=115.0, tol3=7.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'detailed information': 'The coordinates of the vertex in the bottom-left corner of the costmap is correct.\nThe coordinates of the vertex in the bottom-right corner of the costmap is correct.\nThe coordinates of the vertex in the top-right corner of the costmap is correct.\nThe coordinates of the vertex in the top-left corner of the costmap is correct.\nThe total path length for Task 2 is wrong.\nThe total path length for Task 3 is wrong.\n', 'total_score': 20}, 'score': 20}
