{'completion_tokens': 2002, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='We must deliver a JSON object that contains 1) our step-by-step reasoning and 2) a `config` object that in turn holds the source code implementing the required `read` operation.\n\nReasoning steps\n1. Understand schema: the top-level object needs keys `reasoning` (string) and `config` (object).  The `config` object must contain a single required field `read`, which itself is a string with the python implementation.\n2. Design the algorithm for read():\n   • Path resolution – split the supplied path on \'/\', ignore empty segments produced by leading \'/\' and traverse from the root inode (conventionally inode 1) through directory entries until we reach the final component.\n   • Existence checks – raise FileNotFoundError if any component is missing; raise IsADirectoryError if the resolved inode is a directory.\n   • Positional checks – raise ValueError if `pos` is negative or beyond the file size.\n   • Calculate end offset = min(size, pos+length).  Decide which data blocks are involved, using the superblock\'s block_size and inode.direct_blocks list.\n   • For every necessary block, extract the exact slice (taking care of the first and last blocks) and append to a bytearray.\n   • Decode the collected bytes as UTF-8 and return.\n3. Implementation details:\n   • Uses bytearray for efficient concatenation.\n   • Deals gracefully with missing blocks (treats None as empty block).\n   • Stops at EOF even if caller asked for more.\n4. Produce valid JSON: all line-breaks inside the code string are escaped with \\n; double quotes are escaped as \\" where needed.\n\nHaving planned this, the following JSON conforms to the requested schema.', config=ConfigFile(read='def read(fs_img: FileSystemImage, name: str, pos: int, length: int) -> str:\\n    """Read up to `length` bytes from the file `name` in `fs_img`, starting at offset `pos`.\\n\\n    Raises:\\n        FileNotFoundError: if the path does not exist.\\n        IsADirectoryError: if the path names a directory.\\n        ValueError: if `pos` is negative or beyond EOF.\\n    """\\n\\n    # 1.
