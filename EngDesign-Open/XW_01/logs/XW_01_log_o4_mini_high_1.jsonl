{'completion_tokens': 7460, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To implement the filesystem read operation, I first create a helper function to resolve a given absolute or relative path to its inode number. I start at the root directory inode (assumed to be 1), split the path on '/', and traverse the directory entries stored in fs_img.directories. If any path component is not found, I raise FileNotFoundError. After locating the inode, I check whether it exists and is not a directory. If it is a directory, I raise IsADirectoryError. Next, I validate that the read position is within the file bounds; if not, I raise ValueError. I then compute the actual number of bytes to read as the minimum of the requested length and the remaining file size. For reading, I calculate the block size, starting block index based on pos, and the offset within that block. I loop over the direct blocks from that starting point, extracting the relevant slice of each blockâ€™s content using the offset and the remaining bytes count, appending it to a bytearray until I have read the required number of bytes or no more blocks remain. Finally, I decode the accumulated bytes as UTF-8 and return the resulting string. This approach handles partial block reads, avoids reading past EOF, and maintains robust error handling.", config=ConfigFile(read="def read(fs_img: FileSystemImage, name: str, pos: int, length: int) -> str:\n    '''Read up to length bytes from the specified file starting at the given offset and return decoded UTF-8 string.'''\n    # Resolve path to inode\n    def find_inode_by_path(path):\n        # Start at root inode (1)\n        current_ino = 1\n        if path == '' or path == '/':\n            return fs_img.inodes.get(current_ino)\n        parts = [p for p in path.split('/') if p]\n        for part in parts:\n            if current_ino not in fs_img.directories:\n                raise FileNotFoundError(f'Path not found: {path}')\n            entries = fs_img.directories[current_ino]\n            for entry in entries:\n                if entry.name == part:\n                    current_ino = entry.inode\n                    break\n            else:\n                raise FileNotFoundError(f'Path not found: {path}')\n        return fs_img.inodes.get(current_ino)\n\n    inode = find_inode_by_path(name)\n    if inode is None:\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f'File not found: {name}')\n    if inode.is_dir:\n        raise IsADirectoryError(f'Is a directory: {name}')\n\n    # Validate position\n    if pos < 0 or pos > inode.size:\n        raise ValueError(f'Invalid read position: {pos}')\n    # Compute how many bytes to read\n    read_len = min(length, inode.size - pos)\n    if read_len <= 0:\n        return ''\n\n    block_size = fs_img.superblock.block_size\n    data = bytearray()\n    remaining = read_len\n    block_idx = pos // block_size\n    offset = pos % block_size\n    while remaining > 0 and block_idx < len(inode.direct_blocks):\n        blk_num = inode.direct_blocks[block_idx]\n        blk_data = fs_img.data_blocks[blk_num] or b''\n        start = offset\n        end = min(len(blk_data), offset + remaining)\n        chunk = blk_data[start:end]\n        data.extend(chunk)\n        read = len(chunk)\n        remaining -= read\n        block_idx += 1\n        offset = 0\n    return data.decode('utf-8')")), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'read_root_file': "Failed: expected b'Hello', got Hello", 'read_subdir_file': "Failed: expected b'Hello', got Hello", 'read': 'Failed', 'content correctness': 'Failed', 'read_invalid': 'Passed: exception raised as expected'}, 'score': 20}
