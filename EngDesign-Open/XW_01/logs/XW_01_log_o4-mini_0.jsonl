{"completion_tokens": 2111, "response": "reasoning='To implement the `read` operation we must:\\n\\n1. Resolve the path to locate the target inode:\\n   - Split the input path on \u201c/\u201d and traverse directory entries starting from the root inode (assumed to be 1).\\n   - At each component, look up the matching DirEntry in the current directory\u2019s list; if missing, raise FileNotFoundError.\\n\\n2. Once the final inode is found:\\n   - Verify it exists; if not, FileNotFoundError.\\n   - If it\u2019s a directory, raise IsADirectoryError.\\n   - Check that the requested start offset `pos` is in the valid range (0 \u2264 pos \u2264 file size); otherwise ValueError.\\n\\n3. Determine how many bytes to read:\\n   - Compute `end_pos = min(pos + length, inode.size)`, then `to_read = end_pos - pos`.\\n\\n4. Read data block by block:\\n   - Use the filesystem\u2019s `block_size` to compute which `direct_blocks` contain the desired data.\\n   - For the first block, start at the appropriate offset; thereafter read full blocks until the requested byte count is satisfied.\\n   - Append each chunk into a `bytearray`.\\n\\n5.
