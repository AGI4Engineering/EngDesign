I will use the provided information to iteratively estimate the radius and its impact on these parameters. The general approach involves estimating the peak heat flux and total heat load as a function of radius, and then finding a radius that keeps both below their limits. A larger radius will reduce peak heat flux but increase total heat load. Also, a larger radius reduces deceleration. A first estimate starts from 1m, and adjust the reliable radius iteratively.\n\n1. **Initial Radius Estimation:** Start with a reasonable initial guess for the radius, say 1 meter.\n2. **Peak Heat Flux Estimation:** For a spherical spacecraft, the peak heat flux is approximately inversely proportional to the square root of the radius. Given a starting velocity of 5500 m/s at 40km. If the radius is 1 m,  the peak heat flux could be estimated at a value that would exceed 1000 W/cm², or 10000000 W/m².  To bring it down, we can increase the radius. Let us assume that we need to decrease the heat flux by a factor of more than 10. Thus, we increase the radius.\n3. **Total Heat Load Estimation:** The total heat load is roughly proportional to the radius. Thus, it could exceed the limit. We must find a balance between peak heat flux and total heat load. We target 100 MJ/m² and iteratively modify our initial estimate.\n4. **Deceleration Estimation:** Deceleration is inversely proportional to the mass and proportional to the area. So, a larger radius reduces deceleration. We must verify that the deceleration doesn't exceed 30g.\n5. **Iterative Adjustment:** Based on the initial estimations, adjust the radius iteratively, calculating the approximate heat flux, heat load, and deceleration for each radius value. We aim to find a value that satisfies all constraints.
