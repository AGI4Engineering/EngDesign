{'completion_tokens': 1948, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To implement the `delete` function, we need to follow the specified steps carefully to ensure the filesystem\'s integrity is maintained. Here\'s the step-by-step reasoning:\\n\\n1. **Split the Path**: The path is split into the parent directory path and the target name to be deleted. For example, `/a/b/c` splits into parent `/a/b` and name `c`.\\n\\n2. **Look Up Parent Path**: We need to traverse the filesystem to find the parent directory. If the parent path doesn\'t exist, we raise `FileNotFoundError`. If it exists but isn\'t a directory, we raise `NotADirectoryError`.\\n\\n3. **Find Target Entry**: Within the parent directory\'s entries, we look for an entry matching the target name. If not found, raise `FileNotFoundError`.\\n\\n4. **Inspect Target Inode**:\\n   - If the target is a directory, we check if it\'s empty. If not, raise `OSError(\\"Directory not empty\\")`.\\n   - If it\'s a file or an empty directory, we proceed to free its resources. For files, we free all data blocks referenced in the inode\'s `direct_blocks`.\\n\\n5. **Remove Inode and Directory Entry**:\\n   - Remove the inode from `fs_img.inodes`.\\n   - Remove the directory entry from the parent\'s directory list.\\n\\n6. **Return Updated Filesystem**: The mutated `fs_img` is returned with the target entry and its resources freed.\\n\\nThis ensures that the filesystem remains consistent after the deletion operation.', config=ConfigFile(read='def read(fs_img: FileSystemImage, name: str, pos: int, length: int) -> str:\\n    """Read up to `length` bytes from file `name` starting at offset `pos`."""', write='def write(fs_img: FileSystemImage, name: str, pos: int, data: str) -> FileSystemImage:\\n    """Write UTFâ€‘8 bytes of `data` into file `name` at offset `pos` and return the updated image."""', create='def create(fs_img: FileSystemImage, path: str, is_dir: bool = False) -> FileSystemImage:\\n    """Create a new file or directory at `path`, returning the mutated image."""', delete='def delete(fs_img: FileSystemImage, path: str) -> FileSystemImage:\\n    """Delete the entry at `path` and return the updated image."""')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'delete': False, 'delete_nested': False, 'delete_parent': False, 'fnf_error': False, 'not_directory_error': False, 'dir_not_empty_error': False}, 'score': 0}
