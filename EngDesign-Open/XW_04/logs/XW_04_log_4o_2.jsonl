{'completion_tokens': 1610, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To implement the `delete` function for the `FileSystemImage`, we need to follow a series of steps to ensure the correct deletion of a file or directory while maintaining the integrity of the filesystem. Here\'s a detailed breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Path Parsing**: We need to split the given `path` into `parent_path` and `name`. This allows us to locate the parent directory and the specific file or directory to be deleted.\n\n2. **Parent Directory Lookup**: We must locate the `parent_path` in the filesystem:\n   - If the `parent_path` does not exist, we raise a `FileNotFoundError`.\n   - If the `parent_path` exists but is not a directory, we raise a `NotADirectoryError`.\n\n3. **Locate Directory Entry**: Within the parent directory, we search for an entry with a `name` that matches the one we want to delete:\n   - If no such entry is found, we raise a `FileNotFoundError`.\n   - We retrieve the `inode` number associated with this entry.\n\n4. **Inspect Target Inode**: We examine the inode to determine if it is a file or directory:\n   - If it is a directory and not empty, we raise an `OSError("Directory not empty")`.\n   - If it is a directory and empty, we remove its entry list from `fs_img.directories`.\n   - If it is a file, we proceed to free its data blocks by iterating over `inode.direct_blocks` and calling `fs_img.free_block(index)` for each block.\n\n5. **Remove Inode**: We remove the inode from `fs_img.inodes`.\n\n6. **Remove Directory Entry**: We remove the directory entry from the parent’s `fs_img.directories[parent_inode.ino]`.\n\n7. **Return Updated Filesystem**: Finally, we return the mutated `fs_img` to reflect the changes made by the deletion operation.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the deletion operation is performed correctly and that the filesystem\'s integrity is preserved.', config=ConfigFile(read='def read(fs_img: FileSystemImage, path: str) -> bytes:\n    """\n    Read the content of the file at the given path within the FileSystemImage.\n    Return the file content as bytes.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - fs_img: the FileSystemImage instance containing inodes, directories,\n              and data blocks.\n    - path:   an absolute or relative path to the file to read.\n\n    Returns:\n    - The content of the file as bytes.\n\n    Exceptions:\n    - `FileNotFoundError` if the path does not exist.\n    - `IsADirectoryError` if the path is a directory.\n    """\n    # Your implementation here…', write='def write(fs_img: FileSystemImage, path: str, content: bytes) -> FileSystemImage:\n    """\n    Write the given content to the file at the specified path within the FileSystemImage.\n    If the file does not exist, create it.
