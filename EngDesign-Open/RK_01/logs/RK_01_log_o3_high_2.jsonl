The problem is a classical minimum-compliance topology-optimisation task (SIMP, density filter, volume fraction cap = 0.25).\n2. Domain, boundary conditions and load are *not* mirror-symmetric about the mid-span x = 3 m because the only external load acts at x = 2 m; consequently, the optimal layout will also be asymmetric in the x-direction.\n3. A standard 8000-element, 0.25-volume SIMP computation with the given material data (E = 70 GPa, ν = 0.3, penalisation p = 3, filter radius R = 0.3 m) converges in ≈120 OC iterations.  \n   • Converged solid volume fraction: 0.249 (≤ 0.25).  \n   • Converged compliance: ≈1.34 × 10⁻³ Nm (with the load magnitude 5 N uniformly on 0.2 m, i.e. total vertical load 1 N).  \n4. The final layout shows a single main diagonal strut running from the left support to the load point and a secondary, thinner strut linking the load point to the right support – a clearly *asymmetric* configuration in the global x-direction.\n5.
