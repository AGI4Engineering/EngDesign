{'completion_tokens': 892, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I analyzed a topology optimization problem for a 2D rectangular domain (6×1) with a vertical load at (2,1) and supports at (0,0) and (6,0). The optimization objective is to minimize compliance with a volume fraction constraint of 0.25. After considering the problem setup with E=70000, ν=0.3, and a filter radius of 0.3, I determined that the optimal solution would be asymmetric due to the off-center load position. The load at x=2 is closer to the left support than the right support, which creates an uneven load distribution. The resulting minimum compliance (C_y_hat) would be approximately 2.85, while the volume fraction (VF) would reach the maximum allowed value of 0.25. The design would feature more material in the left portion of the domain compared to the right, making it asymmetric about the x-axis.', config=ConfigFile(C_y_hat=2.85, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Asymmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'compliance_error': 'Fail (CE=48.4724)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Pass'}, 'score': 50}
