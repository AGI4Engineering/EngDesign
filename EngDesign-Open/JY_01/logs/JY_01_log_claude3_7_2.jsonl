First linear polarizer at angle θ1 (angle12)\n2. Quarter wave plate (QWP) at angle θ2 (angle22)\n3. Second linear polarizer at angle θ3 (angle32)\n\nThe input Stokes vector [1, 0.6, 0.2, 0] represents partially linearly polarized light with:\n- S0 = 1 (total intensity)\n- S1 = 0.6 (horizontal/vertical polarization component)\n- S2 = 0.2 (45°/135° polarization component)\n- S3 = 0 (no circular polarization)\n\nThe desired output [0.3, -0.3, 0, 0] represents linearly polarized light with:\n- S0 = 0.3 (total intensity)\n- S1 = -0.3 (vertical polarization since S1 is negative and equal to -S0)\n- S2 = 0 (no 45°/135° polarization)\n- S3 = 0 (no circular polarization)\n\nSince S1 = -S0 in the output, the light must be fully linearly polarized along the vertical axis (90° or -90°). This immediately suggests our final polarizer should be at 90°.\n\nTo achieve the specific intensity reduction from 1 to 0.3 and conversion to vertical polarization, I need to set the first polarizer and quarter wave plate correctly.\n\nAfter analyzing the Mueller matrices for these components and calculating their combined effect, I've determined one solution is:\n\n- First linear polarizer (angle12): 45° - This will select the 45° component of the incoming light\n- Quarter wave plate (angle22): 0° - This will convert some of the linear polarization to circular\n- Second linear polarizer (angle32): 90° - This will select only the vertical component\n\nThis configuration will transform the input Stokes vector to the desired output with vertical polarization and the required intensity reduction.", config=ConfigFile(angle12=45.0, angle22=0.0, angle32=90.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'S0': {'predicted': 0.3, 'ground_truth': -0.3, 'diff': 0.6, 'within_tolerance': False}, 'S1': {'predicted': -0.3, 'ground_truth': 0.3, 'diff': 0.6, 'within_tolerance': False}, 'S2': {'predicted': 3.67394039744206e-17, 'ground_truth': 0.0, 'diff': 3.67394039744206e-17, 'within_tolerance': True}, 'S3': {'predicted': 0.0, 'ground_truth': 0.0, 'diff': 0.0, 'within_tolerance': True}}, 'score': 40}
