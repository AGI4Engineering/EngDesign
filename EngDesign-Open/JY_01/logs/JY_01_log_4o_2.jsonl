{'completion_tokens': 530, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To solve this problem, we need to determine the angles of the optical components (two linear polarizers and one quarter wave plate) such that the input Stokes vector [1, 0.6, 0.2, 0] is transformed into the output Stokes vector [0.3, -0.3, 0, 0].\n\n1. **Understanding the Components:**\n   - **Linear Polarizer:** A linear polarizer will transmit light that is polarized along its transmission axis. The effect of a linear polarizer on a Stokes vector can be represented by a Mueller matrix.\n   - **Quarter Wave Plate (QWP):** A QWP introduces a phase shift of 90 degrees (π/2 radians) between the orthogonal polarization components. The effect of a QWP is also represented by a Mueller matrix, which depends on its orientation angle.\n\n2. **Stokes Vector Transformation:**\n   - The transformation of the Stokes vector through these optical components can be described by the sequence of Mueller matrices corresponding to each component.\n   - The sequence is: Linear Polarizer 1 (angle θ1) -> Quarter Wave Plate (angle θ2) -> Linear Polarizer 2 (angle θ3).\n\n3. **Mathematical Formulation:**\n   - The output Stokes vector S_out is given by the product of the Mueller matrices and the input Stokes vector S_in:\n     \n     S_out = M_LP(θ3) * M_QWP(θ2) * M_LP(θ1) * S_in\n     \n   - Where M_LP(θ) is the Mueller matrix for a linear polarizer at angle θ, and M_QWP(θ) is the Mueller matrix for a quarter wave plate at angle θ.\n\n4. **Solving for Angles:**\n   - We need to solve the above equation to find the angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 that satisfy the condition S_out = [0.3, -0.3, 0, 0].\n   - This involves setting up the equations based on the Mueller matrices and solving for the angles.\n\n5. **Constraints:**\n   - The angles must be within the range of -180 to 180 degrees.\n\nBy solving these equations, we can determine the required angles for the polarizers and the quarter wave plate.', config=ConfigFile(angle12=30.0, angle22=45.0, angle32=60.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'S0': {'predicted': 0.04934301395927943, 'ground_truth': -0.3, 'diff': 0.3493430139592794, 'within_tolerance': False}, 'S1': {'predicted': -0.0246715069796397, 'ground_truth': 0.3, 'diff': 0.3246715069796397, 'within_tolerance': False}, 'S2': {'predicted': 0.04273230358802614, 'ground_truth': 0.0, 'diff': 0.04273230358802614, 'within_tolerance': True}, 'S3': {'predicted': 0.0, 'ground_truth': 0.0, 'diff': 0.0, 'within_tolerance': True}}, 'score': 40}
