First, I recognized that the output Stokes vector [0.3, -0.3, 0, 0] represents vertically polarized light with an intensity of 0.3. Since the output has a negative S1 component, I set angle32 = 90째 (vertical). With angle12 = 0째 (horizontal), I calculated how the Stokes vector would transform through each component. For angle22 = 30째, the Stokes vector after the QWP becomes [0.8, 0.2, 0.346, 0.693]. After passing through LP2 at 90째, this yields exactly [0.3, -0.3, 0, 0], confirming these angles work correctly. I verified this by manually calculating: S'''0 = 0.5 * (0.8 - 0.2) = 0.3 and S'''1 = -0.5 * (0.8 - 0.2) = -0.3, with S'''2 and S'''3 being 0 as required.", config=ConfigFile(angle12=0.0, angle22=30.0, angle32=90.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'S0': {'predicted': 0.1999999999999999, 'ground_truth': -0.3, 'diff': 0.4999999999999999, 'within_tolerance': False}, 'S1': {'predicted': -0.1999999999999999, 'ground_truth': 0.3, 'diff': 0.4999999999999999, 'within_tolerance': False}, 'S2': {'predicted': 2.4492935982947053e-17, 'ground_truth': 0.0, 'diff': 2.4492935982947053e-17, 'within_tolerance': True}, 'S3': {'predicted': 0.0, 'ground_truth': 0.0, 'diff': 0.0, 'within_tolerance': True}}, 'score': 40}
