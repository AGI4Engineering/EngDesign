{'completion_tokens': 432, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a PID controller for the mass-spring-damper system, we need to consider the system's transfer function and the desired performance criteria. The system is described by the differential equation: \\( m\\ddot{x} + b\\dot{x} + kx = F \\). Given the parameters, the transfer function is:\n\n\\[ G(s) = \\frac{1}{ms^2 + bs + k} = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 10s + 20} \\]\n\nThe PID controller has the form:\n\n\\[ C(s) = K_p + \\frac{K_i}{s} + K_d s \\]\n\nThe closed-loop transfer function is:\n\n\\[ T(s) = \\frac{C(s)G(s)}{1 + C(s)G(s)} \\]\n\nTo meet the performance requirements:\n1. **Settling Time \\( T_s < 0.2 \\) seconds**: This requires a fast response, which can be achieved by increasing the proportional gain \\( K_p \\) and possibly adding a derivative term \\( K_d \\) to improve the transient response.\n2. **Overshoot \\( M_p < 5\\% \\)**: This can be controlled by tuning \\( K_d \\) to dampen the response.\n3. **Steady-state error = 0**: This requires an integral term \\( K_i \\) to eliminate steady-state error.\n\nGiven these requirements, a PI controller might be sufficient, but a PID controller will provide more flexibility. Let's choose initial values and adjust as needed:\n- \\( K_p = 350 \\)\n- \\( K_i = 300 \\)\n- \\( K_d = 50 \\)\n\nThese values are chosen to provide a balance between fast response, minimal overshoot, and zero steady-state error. Further tuning may be required based on simulation results.", config=ConfigFile(Kp=350.0, Ki=300.0, Kd=50.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'Stability': True, 'Settling Time (s)': np.float64(0.8318170002599429), 'Overshoot (%)': 0}, 'score': 100}
