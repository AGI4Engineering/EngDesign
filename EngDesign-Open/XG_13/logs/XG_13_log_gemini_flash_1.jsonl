{"completion_tokens": 519, "response": "reasoning='The mass-spring-damper system has the following parameters: m = 1 kg, b = 10 N s/m, and k = 20 N/m. The transfer function of the open-loop system is G(s) = 1 / (ms^2 + bs + k) = 1 / (s^2 + 10s + 20). The desired performance requirements are Ts < 0.2 seconds and Mp < 5%. \\n\\nTo achieve zero steady-state error, an integral term (Ki) is required. To improve settling time and reduce overshoot, proportional (Kp) and derivative (Kd) terms are added. \\n\\nTo achieve a settling time less than 0.2 seconds, the closed-loop system must have a large enough bandwidth. The overshoot requirement can be met by ensuring a reasonable phase margin. A higher Kp value will generally decrease the settling time, but increase the overshoot if not carefully tuned with Kd. A higher Kd helps reduce the overshoot.\\n\\nAfter several iterations with different values, the following PID parameters were chosen. Kp = 100, Ki = 500, Kd = 10.\\n\\nWith Kp = 100, Ki = 500, Kd = 10, the PID controller is C(s) = 100 + 500/s + 10s = (10s^2 + 100s + 500) / s. The closed-loop transfer function is T(s) = C(s)G(s) / (1 + C(s)G(s)) = (10s^2 + 100s + 500) / (s(s^2 + 10s + 20) + 10s^2 + 100s + 500) = (10s^2 + 100s + 500) / (s^3 + 20s^2 + 120s + 500).' config=ConfigFile(Kp=100.0, Ki=500.0, Kd=10.0)", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"Stability": true, "Settling Time (s)": 1.1067193675889329, "Overshoot (%)": 13.67070445062446}, "score": 70}
