{'completion_tokens': 3397, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A practical way to arrive at a suitable PID design is to first treat the mass-spring-damper system as a second-order plant and choose P and D terms to meet the settling-time and overshoot targets (using a second-order approximation), then add a moderate integral term to drive the steady-state error to zero. \n\nThe nominal open-loop plant is G(s) = 1 / (s² + 10s + 20).  A convenient approach is to (1) specify a natural frequency and damping ratio that achieve Ts < 0.2 s and Mp < 5% and (2) match that to a PD controller, then (3) add a small integral gain to remove steady-state error. \n\nFor instance, aiming for a damped natural frequency of around 25–30 rad/s with ζ ≈ 0.8 yields an approximate second-order characteristic equation s² + 40s + 625.  Matching this with G(s) under PD control leads to roughly Kp ≈ 600 and Kd ≈ 30.  A modest integral term (e.g., Ki ≈ 300) then ensures zero steady-state error for a step input without significantly degrading transient performance.  Consequently, the gains:\n• Kp = 600\n• Ki = 300\n• Kd = 30\nshould satisfy the given performance requirements of Ts < 0.2 s, Mp < 5%, and zero steady-state error.  Final fine-tuning may be carried out numerically or in simulation if desired.', config=ConfigFile(Kp=600.0, Ki=300.0, Kd=30.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Stability': True, 'Settling Time (s)': np.float64(0.5454545454545454), 'Overshoot (%)': np.float64(6.228231712313681)}, 'score': 70}
