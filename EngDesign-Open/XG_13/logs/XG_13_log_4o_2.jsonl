{'completion_tokens': 430, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design a PID controller for the mass-spring-damper system, we need to consider the system's transfer function and the desired performance specifications. The system is described by the differential equation: \\( m\\ddot{x} + b\\dot{x} + kx = F \\). Given the parameters, the transfer function can be derived as:\n\n\\[ G(s) = \\frac{1}{ms^2 + bs + k} = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 10s + 20} \\]\n\nThe PID controller has the form:\n\n\\[ C(s) = K_p + \\frac{K_i}{s} + K_d s \\]\n\nThe closed-loop transfer function is:\n\n\\[ T(s) = \\frac{C(s)G(s)}{1 + C(s)G(s)} \\]\n\nTo meet the performance requirements:\n1. **Settling Time \\(T_s < 0.2\\) seconds**: This requires a fast response, which can be achieved by increasing the proportional gain \\(K_p\\) and possibly adding derivative action \\(K_d\\) to improve damping.\n2. **Overshoot \\(M_p < 5\\%\\)**: This can be controlled by adjusting \\(K_d\\) to increase damping and reduce overshoot.\n3. **Steady-state error = 0**: This requires integral action \\(K_i\\) to eliminate steady-state error.\n\nA reasonable starting point is to use a PD controller to meet the settling time and overshoot requirements, and then add a small integral action to eliminate steady-state error. Let's choose:\n- \\(K_p = 300\\)\n- \\(K_i = 10\\)\n- \\(K_d = 20\\)\n\nThese values are chosen to provide a balance between fast response, low overshoot, and zero steady-state error.", config=ConfigFile(Kp=300.0, Ki=10.0, Kd=20.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'Stability': True, 'Settling Time (s)': nan, 'Overshoot (%)': 0}, 'score': 100}
