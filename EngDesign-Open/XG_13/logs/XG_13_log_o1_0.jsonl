{'completion_tokens': 3463, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='A straightforward way to meet these relatively stringent time and overshoot requirements while still enforcing zero steady‐state error is to push the closed‐loop poles far to the left (giving a fast response) and include integral action to eliminate steady‐state error. One systematic way is to pick desired closed‐loop poles (for example, all real and large in magnitude to keep overshoot negligible and settling time short) and then match coefficients in the characteristic polynomial. \n\nSuppose we choose the closed‐loop poles to lie at −50, −50, and −60. That will ensure a very fast (sub‐0.2\xa0second) and overdamped response (and hence low overshoot) and provides zero steady‐state error because of the integral term. The closed‐loop characteristic polynomial then becomes\n\n  (s+50)(s+50)(s+60) = s^3 + 160 s^2 + 8500 s + 150000.\n\nOn the other hand, when the plant is 1 / (s^2 + 10 s + 20) and the controller is PID with transfer function Kp + Ki/s + Kd s, the resulting closed‐loop characteristic equation in expanded form is:\n\n  s^3 + (10 + Kd) s^2 + (20 + Kp) s + Ki = 0.\n\nBy matching the coefficients of these two polynomials, we find:\n\n  10 + Kd = 160   =>   Kd = 150,\n  20 + Kp = 8500  =>   Kp = 8480,\n  Ki = 150000.\n\nThese relatively large gains insert roots far to the left, giving a settling time under 0.2\xa0s, an overdamped response with minimal overshoot (well below 5%), and integral action to ensure zero steady‐state error.\n', config=ConfigFile(Kp=8480.0, Ki=150000.0, Kd=150.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Stability': True, 'Settling Time (s)': np.float64(0.062169007598434266), 'Overshoot (%)': np.float64(18.065633910857116)}, 'score': 70}
