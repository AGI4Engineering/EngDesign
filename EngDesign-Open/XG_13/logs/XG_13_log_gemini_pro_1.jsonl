{"completion_tokens": 1243, "response": "reasoning=\"1. **System Analysis**: The mass-spring-damper system is described by the equation `m*x'' + b*x' + k*x = F(t)`. Given `m=1 kg`, `b=10 Ns/m`, `k=20 N/m`. The Laplace transform gives the plant transfer function `P(s) = X(s)/U(s) = 1 / (m*s^2 + b*s + k) = 1 / (s^2 + 10s + 20)`.\\n\\n2. **Performance Requirements**:\\n   - Settling time: `Ts < 0.2 seconds` (using 2% criterion)\\n   - Overshoot: `Mp < 5%`\\n   - Steady-state error: `ess = 0` for a step input.\\n\\n3. **Controller Choice**: To achieve zero steady-state error for a step input with a type 0 plant (`P(0) = 1/20 != infinity`), an integral term is required in the controller. Thus, a PI or PID controller is necessary. We will design a PID controller of the form `C(s) = Kp + Ki/s + Kd*s = (Kd*s^2 + Kp*s + Ki) / s`.\\n\\n4. **Design Strategy: Pole-Zero Cancellation**: A common and effective strategy for PID design is to use the controller zeros to cancel the plant poles. The plant poles are the roots of the denominator `s^2 + 10s + 20 = 0`.\\n   We design the numerator of the PID controller, `Kd*s^2 + Kp*s + Ki`, to be proportional to the plant's characteristic polynomial: `Kd*s^2 + Kp*s + Ki = K_tune * (s^2 + 10s + 20)`.\\n   This implies:\\n   - `Kd = K_tune`\\n   - `Kp = 10 * K_tune`\\n   - `Ki = 20 * K_tune`\\n\\n5. **Closed-Loop Transfer Function**: With this cancellation, the open-loop transfer function `L(s) = C(s)P(s)` becomes:\\n   `L(s) = [K_tune * (s^2 + 10s + 20) / s] * [1 / (s^2 + 10s + 20)] = K_tune / s`.\\n   The closed-loop transfer function `T(s)` with unity feedback is:\\n   `T(s) = L(s) / (1 + L(s)) = (K_tune/s) / (1 + K_tune/s) = (K_tune/s) / ((s + K_tune)/s) = K_tune / (s + K_tune)`.\\n\\n6. **Performance Analysis of the Resulting System**:\\n   The closed-loop system `T(s) = K_tune / (s + K_tune)` is a first-order system.\\n   - **Steady-state error (`ess`)**: For a unit step input, `ess = 1 - T(0) = 1 - (K_tune / K_tune) = 1 - 1 = 0`. This meets the requirement.\\n   - **Overshoot (`Mp`)**: For a first-order system, the overshoot is `0%`. This meets the requirement (`Mp < 5%`).\\n   - **Settling time (`Ts`)**: For a first-order system, the 2% settling time is approximately `4 * tau`, where `tau = 1/K_tune` is the time constant. So, `Ts = 4 / K_tune`.\\n     We require `Ts < 0.2 s`:\\n     `4 / K_tune < 0.2`\\n     `K_tune > 4 / 0.2`\\n     `K_tune > 20`.\\n\\n7. **Selection of `K_tune` and PID Parameters**:\\n   Let's choose `K_tune = 25`. This value satisfies `K_tune > 20` and provides some margin. \\n   With `K_tune = 25`, the settling time will be `Ts = 4 / 25 = 0.16 s`, which is less than `0.2 s`.\\n   Now, we calculate the PID parameters:\\n   - `Kd = K_tune = 25`\\n   - `Kp = 10 * K_tune = 10 * 25 = 250`\\n   - `Ki = 20 * K_tune = 20 * 25 = 500`\\n\\n8. **Conclusion**: The PID controller with `Kp = 250`, `Ki = 500`, and `Kd = 25` results in a closed-loop system `T(s) = 25 / (s + 25)`. This system meets all specified performance requirements: `Ts = 0.16s < 0.2s`, `Mp = 0% < 5%`, and `ess = 0` for a step input.\" config=ConfigFile(Kp=250.0, Ki=500.0, Kd=25.0)", "passed": true, "evaluation_result": {"Stability": true, "Settling Time (s)": 0.1602209944751381, "Overshoot (%)": 6.661338147750939e-14}, "score": 100}
