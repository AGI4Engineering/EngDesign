The robot starts at (17, 2). The robot has a size of 2x2 and the speed limit is 2 in each axis.\n\n1.  **Represent the environment:** The environment consists of static obstacles (rectangles) and moving pedestrians (trajectories).\n2.  **Initial trajectory to A and B:** Generate an initial path for the robot to go from start to A, and then from A to B. \n3.  **Collision Check with static obstacles:** Check the initial path for collisions with static obstacles and modifies the path to avoid these.\n4.  **Collision Check with Pedestrians:** Check for any collisions between the robot's path and the pedestrians' paths. Modify the robot's path to avoid any pedestrian collisions.\n5.  **Enforce Speed Limit:** Check that the generated path follows the speed limit of 2 in both the x and y direction between each time step.\n6.  **Optimize Path:** Iteratively improve the path to reduce unnecessary movements and time steps.\n\nHere is a possible trajectory:\n", config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=15, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=13, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=11, y=8), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=9, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=7, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=5, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=5, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=5, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=5, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=7, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=9, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=11, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=13, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=15, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=17, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=19, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=21, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=23, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=25, y=24)])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Start position correct': True, 'Hit Goal A': True, 'Hit Goal B': True, 'Number of collisions with static obstacles': 8, 'Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'Over Speed limit': False}, 'score': 75}
