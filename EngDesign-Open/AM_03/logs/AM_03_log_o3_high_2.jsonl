Obstacle O3 occupies x 15–30 and y 5–10. The robot first steps two cells west so it is clear of O3 before climbing.\n2. While y < 15 the robot remains east of obstacle O1 (x 5–7). After y ≥ 16 it passes above O1, then moves left to reach Goal A.\n3. Goal A (5,20) is reached at t = 15.\n4. To reach Goal B, the robot travels east underneath obstacle O2 (which starts at y = 20) by staying at y = 18 until x > 20, then rises to y = 24.\n5. Goal B (25,24) is reached at t = 25.\n6. At every time step the 2×2 robot footprint was checked against the 2×2 footprints of ped1, ped2 and ped3 as well as against the three rectangular obstacles; no overlaps occur.\nTherefore the path satisfies all requirements: correct start, visits both goals, no collisions, and respects the speed limit.', config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=15, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=13, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=13, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=13, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=11, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=9, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=9, y=8), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=9, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=9, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=9, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=9, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=9, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=7, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=5, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=5, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=7, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=9, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=11, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=13, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=20, x=15, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=21, x=17, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=22, x=19, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=23, x=21, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=24, x=23, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=25, x=25, y=24)])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'Start position correct': True, 'Hit Goal A': True, 'Hit Goal B': True, 'Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'Over Speed limit': False}, 'score': 100}
