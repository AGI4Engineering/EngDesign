{'completion_tokens': 10095, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Static obstacles were mapped: \n   • O1 : x 5-7 , y 0-15  (vertical column)\n   • O2 : x 10-20 , y 20-30 (top–centre block)\n   • O3 : x 15-30 , y 5-10  (horizontal bar)\n   The 2 × 2 robot must keep its whole footprint outside these areas.\n\n2. Pedestrian footprints (also 2 × 2) were inspected for the whole 0-29 s horizon.  In particular, Ped-1 occupies y≈11 after t=14, Ped-2 approaches the left edge after t=22 and Ped-3 climbs the x≈8 column after t=23.  A path that stays mostly in the centre and right side early, and on the far right later, avoids them.\n\n3. Goal order chosen: first Goal-A (5, 20), then Goal-B (25, 24).  This lets the robot use the large free corridor above O3 and slip past O1 before pedestrians arrive there in force.  After touching A the robot drops two cells (to y=18) so it can travel under the bottom edge of O2, then turns east and finally climbs to B once clear of O2.\n\n4. Way-points were turned into 1-second steps, each obeying |Δx| ≤ 2 and |Δy| ≤ 2.  The full list 0-29 is given below.  Every position was checked:\n   • No overlap with O1/O2/O3 when the 2×2 footprint is expanded.\n   • No overlap with any pedestrian footprint at the same t.\n   • Grid limits respected (bottom-left + size ≤ 30).\n\n5. Verification summary:\n   • Start is (17, 2) at t=0.\n   • Robot footprint coincides with Goal-A at t=11.\n   • Robot footprint coincides with Goal-B at t=22 and then stays there.\n   • Speed limit never exceeded.\n   • All collisions (static & dynamic) avoided.\n\nThe trajectory therefore satisfies the specification.', config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=15, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=13, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=11, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=11, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=11, y=8), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=11, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=11, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=9, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=8, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=6, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=5, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=7, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=9, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=11, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=13, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=15, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=17, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=19, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=21, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=20, x=23, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=21, x=25, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=22, x=25, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=23, x=25, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=24, x=25, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=25, x=25, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=26, x=25, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=27, x=25, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=28, x=25, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=29, x=25, y=24)])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'Start position correct': True, 'Hit Goal A': True, 'Hit Goal B': True, 'Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'Over Speed limit': False}, 'score': 100}
