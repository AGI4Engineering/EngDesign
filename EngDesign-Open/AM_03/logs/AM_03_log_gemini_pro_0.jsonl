{'completion_tokens': 2469, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The problem requires navigating a 2x2 robot on a 30x30 grid from a starting position (17,2) to two goals, A (5,20) and B (25,24), in any order, while avoiding static obstacles and moving pedestrians. The robot has a speed limit of 2 units in x and 2 units in y per time step.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Environment and Constraints:**\n    *   Grid: 0-29 for x and y coordinates.\n    *   Robot: 2x2 size. Its position (rx,ry) refers to its bottom-left corner. It occupies cells [rx, rx+1] x [ry, ry+1]. Valid rx, ry are [0, 28].\n    *   Static Obstacles: Three rectangular obstacles. Their coordinates are inclusive.\n        *   Obs1: ((5,0), (7,15)) -> x in [5,7], y in [0,15]\n        *   Obs2: ((10,20), (20,30)) -> effectively x in [10,20], y in [20,29] (due to grid boundary y_max=29)\n        *   Obs3: ((15,5), (30,10)) -> effectively x in [15,29], y in [5,10] (due to grid boundary x_max=29)\n    *   Pedestrians: Three 2x2 pedestrians with given trajectories (t,x,y) from t=0 to t=29.\n    *   Goals: A (5,20), B (25,24).\n    *   Start: (17,2) at t=0.\n    *   Speed Limit: |dx| <= 2, |dy| <= 2 per time step.\n\n2.  **Collision Detection Rules:**\n    *   **Robot vs. Static Obstacle:** An obstacle ((ox1,oy1),(ox2,oy2)) occupies area [ox1,ox2]x[oy1,oy2]. A robot at (rx,ry) collides if its area [rx,rx+1]x[ry,ry+1] overlaps with the obstacle. This occurs if (`rx <= ox2` AND `rx+1 >= ox1`) AND (`ry <= oy2` AND `ry+1 >= oy1`).\n        This translates to forbidden (rx,ry) regions for the robot's bottom-left corner:\n        *   Obs1: `4 <= rx <= 7` AND `0 <= ry <= 15`.\n        *   Obs2: `9 <= rx <= 20` AND `19 <= ry <= 29` (using effective y_max=29 for obstacle).\n        *   Obs3: `14 <= rx <= 29` AND `4 <= ry <= 10` (using effective x_max=29 for obstacle).\n    *   **Robot vs. Pedestrian:** At time t, robot at (rx,ry) and pedestrian at (px,py). Both are 2x2. Collision if (`rx <= px+1` AND `rx+1 >= px`) AND (`ry <= py+1` AND `ry+1 >= py`).\n    *   **Robot vs. Grid Boundaries:** `0 <= rx <= 28` and `0 <= ry <= 28`.\n\n3.  **Path Planning Strategy:**\n    *   **Goal Order:** Decided to visit Goal A then Goal B. Start (17,2) -> A (5,20) -> B (25,24).\n    *   **Path Segment 1: Start (17,2) to Goal A (5,20):**\n        *   Initial position (0, 17, 2). Checked: clear of static obstacles and pedestrians at t=0.\n        *   Obs3 (forbidden for robot: [14,29]x[4,10]) blocks direct upward movement from (17,2) because (17,4) would be a collision. Must move left first until rx < 14.\n            *   (0,17,2) -> (1,15,2) -> (2,13,2). At (13,2), robot (rx=13) is clear of Obs3's x-range [14,29] to its right.\n        *   Now at (2,13,2), moving towards Goal A (5,20). The path generally uses (dx,dy) = (-2,2) per step where possible.\n            *   (2,13,2) -> (3,11,4) -> (4,9,6).\n        *   At (4,9,6), approaching Obs1 (forbidden for robot: [4,7]x[0,15]). Current (9,6) is to the right of Obs1. Goal A (5,20) is to the left of Obs1. Must maneuver around Obs1.\n        *   Strategy: Move upwards along x=9 until ry > 15 (clear of Obs1's y-range [0,15]).\n            *   (4,9,6) -> (5,9,8) -> (6,9,10) -> (7,9,12) -> (8,9,14) -> (9,9,16).\n        *   At (9,9,16), robot (ry=16) is above Obs1's y-extent. Now move towards Goal A (5,20).\n            *   (9,9,16) -> (10,7,18) -> (11,5,20). **Goal A reached at t=11.**\n    *   **Path Segment 2: Goal A (5,20) at t=11 to Goal B (25,24):**\n        *   Current position (11,5,20). Approaching Obs2 (forbidden for robot: [9,20]x[19,29]). Current ry=20 is within Obs2's y-range [19,29]. Cannot move right directly into Obs2's x-range [9,20] while ry=20.\n        *   Strategy: Move downwards along x=5 until ry < 19 (clear of Obs2's y-range [19,29]).\n            *   (11,5,20) -> (12,5,18).\n        *   At (12,5,18), robot (ry=18) is below Obs2's y-extent. Now move right along y=18 until rx > 20 (clear of Obs2's x-range [9,20]).\n            *   (12,5,18) -> (13,7,18) -> (14,9,18) -> (15,11,18) -> (16,13,18) -> (17,15,18) -> (18,17,18) -> (19,19,18) -> (20,21,18).\n        *   At (20,21,18), robot (rx=21) is to the right of Obs2's x-extent. Now move towards Goal B (25,24).\n            *   (20,21,18) -> (21,23,20) -> (22,25,22) -> (23,25,24). **Goal B reached at t=23.**\n    *   **Verification:** Each step in the generated path was manually checked against:\n        *   Static obstacle collision using the derived forbidden (rx,ry) zones.\n        *   Pedestrian collision at the specific time `t` using their given trajectories.\n        *   Speed limits (|dx|<=2, |dy|<=2).\n        *   Grid boundaries (0<=rx,ry<=28).\n    The path is collision-free and meets all requirements.\n\n4.  **Final Trajectory:** The resulting trajectory consists of 24 points (from t=0 to t=23), formatted as a list of objects {t, x, y}.", config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=15, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=13, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=11, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=9, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=9, y=8), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=9, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=9, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=9, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=9, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=7, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=5, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=5, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=7, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=9, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=11, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=13, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=15, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=17, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=19, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=20, x=21, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=21, x=23, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=22, x=25, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=23, x=25, y=24)])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'Start position correct': True, 'Hit Goal A': True, 'Hit Goal B': True, 'Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'Over Speed limit': False}, 'score': 100}
