{'completion_tokens': 1483, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="Okay, I need to generate a collision-free trajectory for a robot to visit two goals, A and B, while avoiding static obstacles and moving pedestrians. The robot starts at (17, 2), Goal A is at (5, 20), and Goal B is at (25, 24). The robot's speed is limited to 2 units per step in either x or y direction. I need to consider the positions of the three pedestrians at each time step and the locations of the static obstacles to plan a safe path. I will try to go to point A and then to point B.\n\nHere is the trajectory I will plan:\n1. t=0, start at (17, 2)\n2. t=1, move to (15, 4) - avoid obstacle 3 at (15,5), avoid ped3 at (24,2)\n3. t=2, move to (13, 6) - avoid ped3 at (23,2)\n4. t=3, move to (11, 8) - avoid ped3 at (22,2)\n5. t=4, move to (9, 10) - avoid ped3 at (21,2)\n6. t=5, move to (7, 12) - avoid ped3 at (20,2)\n7. t=6, move to (5, 14) - avoid obstacle 1 at (5,0), avoid ped3 at (19,2)\n8. t=7, move to (5, 16) - reach Goal A.
