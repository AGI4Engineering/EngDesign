{'completion_tokens': 762, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To navigate the robot from the starting position (17, 2) to the goals A (5, 20) and B (25, 24) without colliding with static obstacles or pedestrians, we need to carefully plan the trajectory. The robot can move up to 2 units in both x and y directions per time step.\n\n1. **Initial Position and Goals**: The robot starts at (17, 2). It needs to reach both goals A (5, 20) and B (25, 24). We can choose to go to A first, then B, or vice versa.\n\n2. **Static Obstacles**: The static obstacles are located at:\n   - ((5, 0), (7, 15))\n   - ((10, 20), (20, 30))\n   - ((15, 5), (30, 10))\n   The robot must avoid these areas.\n\n3. **Pedestrian Paths**: The robot must also avoid the paths of pedestrians 'ped1', 'ped2', and 'ped3'.\n\n4. **Path Planning**:\n   - **Step 1**: Move from (17, 2) to (5, 20) (Goal A).\n     - Avoid the obstacle at ((15, 5), (30, 10)) by moving upwards first.\n     - Avoid pedestrian paths by checking their positions at each time step.\n   - **Step 2**: Move from (5, 20) to (25, 24) (Goal B).\n     - Avoid the obstacle at ((10, 20), (20, 30)) by moving around it.\n     - Again, check pedestrian paths to avoid collisions.\n\n5. **Speed Limit**: Ensure the robot does not exceed the speed limit of 2 units per time step in either direction.\n\n6. **Collision Check**: At each time step, ensure the robot's position does not overlap with any pedestrian or static obstacle.\n\nBy following these steps, we can generate a collision-free trajectory for the robot.", config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=17, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=17, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=17, y=8), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=17, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=17, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=17, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=17, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=17, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=15, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=13, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=11, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=9, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=7, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=5, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=7, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=9, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=11, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=13, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=15, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=20, x=17, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=21, x=19, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=22, x=21, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=23, x=23, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=24, x=25, y=24)])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Start position correct': True, 'Hit Goal A': True, 'Hit Goal B': True, 'Number of collisions with static obstacles': 13, 'Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'Over Speed limit': False}, 'score': 75}
