The path is planned as follows:\n1. **Avoiding Obstacles**: The robot moves west to x=13 and north to y=6 to avoid the third obstacle. It then navigates east and north to reach Goal B by t=12.\n2. **Reaching Goal B**: The robot moves diagonally northeast to B, ensuring no overlap with obstacles or pedestrians.\n3. **Path to Goal A**: After B, the robot moves south and west, detouring around the second obstacle and avoiding pedestrians, finally reaching A by t=24.\n4. **Collision Checks**: Each step verifies no overlap with pedestrian trajectories (ped1, ped2, ped3) and static obstacles.
