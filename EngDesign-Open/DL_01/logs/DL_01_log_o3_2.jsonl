{'completion_tokens': 4012, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Step-by-step selection of the five most influential knobs\n1. Flash_Channel_Count – doubling the number of independent back-end channels linearly increases the number of outstanding NAND operations that can be served in parallel. With an 8-channel baseline the SSD is already host–bus limited only for extremely large transfers, therefore moving to 12–16 channels gives >20 % bandwidth gain for all throughput-oriented mixes, and also shortens average queueing time (latency) for highly parallel read streams.\n2. Channel_Transfer_Rate – internal ONFi/Toggle transfer rate governs how quickly data can be moved between the controller and each channel once the flash core finishes a read/program. Raising the rate from 800 MT/s to 1 600 MT/s halves this portion of the service time, giving ~25 % overall latency reduction on read-intensive, small-IO workloads when it is the dominant portion.\n3. Chip_No_Per_Channel – adding more chips per channel increases die-level interleaving; even when a single die is busy with a long program/erase, the channel can accept work for the other dies. Moving from 4 → 6 or 8 chips typically yields 30–60 % backend throughput gain in write-heavy analytic workloads and 20 % latency gain for mixed OLTP/OLAP traces where queue stalls are frequent.\n4. Page_Read_Latency_LSB – this is the intrinsic NAND cell access time. For latency-bound KV/Database/WebSearch traces, cutting the 5 µs baseline to ~4 µs (or below) directly reduces average read latency by 20 %. Achieving this may require migrating the hot data to faster word-line programming mode or even SLC-caching, but it can be done without touching other knobs.\n5. Overprovisioning_Ratio – increasing spare area reduces write-amplification and GC interference, which is the dominant source of long tail latency in write-heavy streams. Raising OP from 12.6 % to 20–25 % lowers average service time for update-heavy Cloud-storage/KV/DB traces by >20 %, even when no other parameter is changed.\n\nWhy other candidates were not selected: PCIe bandwidth is already ample (4 × 8 GB/s = 32 GB/s) relative to backend throughput, IO_Queue_Depth only helps when the host is not already issuing enough outstanding I/Os and can hurt latency-sensitive apps; DRAM/cache timing tweaks give only single-digit gains; GC policies affect the tail rather than mean.\n\nParameter-by-parameter feasibility analysis\n• Flash_Channel_Count – ASIC pin-count and PCB routing allow up to 16–18 channels for the given controller family. 20 % improvement is therefore feasible for every stream that can exploit parallelism; for tiny random reads (KV) the benefit is negligible → "impossible" for that case.\n• Channel_Transfer_Rate – next-gen Toggle-4/ONFi-5 parts at 1 600 MT/s already exist, so single-parameter upgrade is realistic.\n• Chip_No_Per_Channel – the thermal envelope allows doubling packages (8) if we keep 16 nm/128-layer parts.\n• Page_Read_Latency_LSB – using SLC-cache or a new fast-read command can drop 5 µs → 4 µs (or 3.5 µs). Where read latency dominates, this single change gives the required 20 %.\n• Overprovisioning_Ratio – reserving additional flash die space is purely a provisioning decision; moving to 0.20–0.25 is straightforward.\n\nMapping the knobs to each workload\nBig-Data and Maps are large-IO, throughput-bound → channel and chip parallelism dominate; tweaking read-latency alone will not reach +20 % BW.\nCloud-Storage and Advertisement are mixed; both parallelism and GC pressure matter.\nKey-Value Store is 4–16 kB random-read dominated; only intrinsic read-latency or higher SLC overprovisioning can give 20 % mean-latency improvement – other knobs are ineffective individually.\nDatabase (TPCC/TPCH) and WebSearch need both moderate throughput and low read latency; either channel/transfer upgrades or faster read cells individually hit the 20 % target.\n\nBelow are the per-workload single-parameter settings meeting the 20 % criterion; when one knob cannot achieve it alone, the value is marked "impossible".', config=ConfigFile(workloads=[workload_result(parameter_names=['Flash_Channel_Count', 'Channel_Transfer_Rate', 'Chip_No_Per_Channel', 'Page_Read_Latency_LSB', 'Overprovisioning_Ratio'], values=['16', '1600', '8', 'impossible', '0.20']), workload_result(parameter_names=['Flash_Channel_Count', 'Channel_Transfer_Rate', 'Chip_No_Per_Channel', 'Page_Read_Latency_LSB', 'Overprovisioning_Ratio'], values=['12', '1600', '6', 'impossible', '0.20']), workload_result(parameter_names=['Flash_Channel_Count', 'Channel_Transfer_Rate', 'Chip_No_Per_Channel', 'Page_Read_Latency_LSB', 'Overprovisioning_Ratio'], values=['impossible', 'impossible', 'impossible', '4000', '0.25']), workload_result(parameter_names=['Flash_Channel_Count', 'Channel_Transfer_Rate', 'Chip_No_Per_Channel', 'Page_Read_Latency_LSB', 'Overprovisioning_Ratio'], values=['16', '1600', '8', '3500', '0.20']), workload_result(parameter_names=['Flash_Channel_Count', 'Channel_Transfer_Rate', 'Chip_No_Per_Channel', 'Page_Read_Latency_LSB', 'Overprovisioning_Ratio'], values=['14', '1600', '7', '3500', '0.20']), workload_result(parameter_names=['Flash_Channel_Count', 'Channel_Transfer_Rate', 'Chip_No_Per_Channel', 'Page_Read_Latency_LSB', 'Overprovisioning_Ratio'], values=['16', '1600', '8', '4000', '0.20']), workload_result(parameter_names=['Flash_Channel_Count', 'Channel_Transfer_Rate', 'Chip_No_Per_Channel', 'Page_Read_Latency_LSB', 'Overprovisioning_Ratio'], values=['12', '1600', '6', 'impossible', '0.20'])], workload_names=['Big Data Analytics', 'Cloud Storage', 'Key-Value Store', 'Maps', 'Database', 'WebSearch', 'Advertisement'])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'Flash_Channel_Count': {'Tuning Result': 12.0, 'Direction': True, 'Value': 10, 'passed': True}, 'Chip_No_Per_Channel': {'Tuning Result': 6.0, 'Direction': True, 'Value': 8, 'passed': True}}, 'score': 40.0}
