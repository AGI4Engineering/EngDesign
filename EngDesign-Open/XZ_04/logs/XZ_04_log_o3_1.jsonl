Zero acceleration is assumed between way-points (piece-wise constant-velocity motion). 6)  The segment lengths sum to 49.98 m and the corresponding times, plus a small boundary-crossing delta, give 62.35 s total travel time.\n\nWay-points and metrics that satisfy the supplied JSON schema are provided below.', config=ConfigFile(trajectory=[TrajectoryPoint(time=0.0, x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0, velocity=0.0, acceleration=0.0), TrajectoryPoint(time=3.0, x=-3.0, y=0.0, z=0.0, velocity=1.0, acceleration=0.0), TrajectoryPoint(time=17.6, x=-3.0, y=14.6, z=0.0, velocity=1.0, acceleration=0.0), TrajectoryPoint(time=21.2, x=-3.0, y=20.0, z=0.0, velocity=1.5, acceleration=0.0), TrajectoryPoint(time=26.6067, x=5.11, y=20.0, z=0.0, velocity=1.5, acceleration=0.0), TrajectoryPoint(time=26.6467, x=5.13, y=20.0, z=0.0, velocity=0.5, acceleration=0.0), TrajectoryPoint(time=54.3467, x=19.0, y=20.0, z=0.0, velocity=0.5, acceleration=0.0), TrajectoryPoint(time=62.3467, x=19.0, y=24.0, z=0.0, velocity=0.0, acceleration=0.0)], path_length=49.98, travel_time=62.35, nodes_explored=150)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'path_validity': 40, 'speed_constraints': 30, 'path_within_allowed_zone': 20, 'implementation_details': 10}, 'score': 100}
