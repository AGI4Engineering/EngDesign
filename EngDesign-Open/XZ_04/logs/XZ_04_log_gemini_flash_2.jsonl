A path planning algorithm like A* or RRT can be employed. The zones are defined as follows:\n- WHITE_ZONE: (0.11, 7.12, 0), size (10, 15, 0.1), max speed 1 m/s\n- RED_ZONE: (0.11, 22.11, 0), size (10, 15, 0.1), max speed 2 m/s\n- GREEN_ZONE: (12.63, 24.61, 0), size (10, 15, 0.1), max speed 0.5 m/s, rotated by -1.57 radians around the Z axis\n\nObstacles are present at:\n- OBSTACLE_2: (-0.41, 4.78, 0.5), size (1, 1, 1)\n- OBSTACLE_3: (1.58, 11.04, 0.5), size (1, 1, 1)\n- OBSTACLE_1: (3.24, 21.69, 0.5), size (1, 1, 1)\n- OBSTACLE_4: (-1.76, 18.4, 0.5), size (1, 1, 1)\n- OBSTACLE_5: (13.45, 24.52, 0.5), size (1, 1, 1)\n\nA reasonable path might be: Start in WHITE_ZONE, move to RED_ZONE, and finally move to GREEN_ZONE to reach the goal. The path must avoid the obstacles. The time taken in each zone will depend on the path length within that zone and the speed limit.  The acceleration can be assumed constant between trajectory points.\n\nGiven the above analysis, I'll construct a sample trajectory.
