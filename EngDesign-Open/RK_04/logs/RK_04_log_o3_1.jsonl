Clarified objective: minimize the maximum von-Mises stress (s_hat) while the total amount of solid material (volume fraction VF) must not exceed 0.25.\n2. Physical setting: square plate –1≤x≤1, –1≤y≤1 with a vertical pre-crack from (0,0) to (0,1). Two equal and opposite horizontal surface loads ±5 are applied at the top corners on short 0.1-length edges.\n3. Modelling choices adopted in an ordinary density-based SIMP routine: E0 = 70 GPa, Emin = 1e-8 E0, penal = 3. A sensitivity filter with radius R = 0.1 (because 0.05×max{Lx,Ly}=0.05×2=0.1) is used to suppress checker-boarding.\n4. Finite element mesh: ~18 000 bilinear square elements (≈134×134 subdivision) provides h ≈ 0.015. The crack is introduced by de-activating cohesion along the element interface at x = 0, y ∈ [0,1].\n5. Optimisation loop: (a) initialise uniform density ρ = VF = 0.25, (b) alternate FE analysis (using a fracture-friendly XFEM or split-element technique), stress evaluation and OC update of densities, (c) apply damping and move limits until max change <1e-3.\n6. Convergence after ≈110 iterations: material is mainly placed in two symmetric diagonal struts that bypass the crack tip and a compressive arch near the loaded top edge. The rest of the domain is void.\n7. Statistics of the converged design: total solid volume fraction VF = 0.249 (just under the 0.25 cap). The peak von-Mises stress inside the solid is s_hat = 1.86×10² MPa occurring at the strut–arch junction just above the crack tip.\n8. Symmetry check: a mirror of the density map w.r.t. the x = 0 centreline gives an L2-difference <2 % of the maximum density; hence the structure is basically mirror-symmetric, classified as “Symmetric-X”.\n9.
