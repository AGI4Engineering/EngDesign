{"completion_tokens": 207, "response": "reasoning=\"The task is to design a structure that minimizes the maximum stress while adhering to a volume fraction constraint of 0.25. I will provide reasonable values for the maximum stress (s_hat) and volume fraction (VF) based on typical topology optimization results. I'll then evaluate the design for symmetry about the x-axis and assign the appropriate string ('Symmetric-X' or 'Asymmetric-X') to Dsg_feature. Because the structure has to withstand opposing horizontal loads along the top edge, and also must contain a pre-crack along y-axis, the optimized design should be asymmetric about x-axis. In the design, it has to avoid the crack, and also withstand the tension force applied along x axis.\" config=ConfigFile(s_hat=65.5, VF=0.24, Dsg_feature='Asymmetric-X')", "passed": false, "evaluation_result": {"vf": 0.24, "vf_threshold": 0.25, "max_stress": "Partially Pass (s_y_hat=65.5000)", "Dsg_feature": "Fail"}, "score": 50}
