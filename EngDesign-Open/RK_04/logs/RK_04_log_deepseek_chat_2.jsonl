The domain has a pre-crack and is subjected to horizontal loads. We use the density-based SIMP approach with specified material parameters and filter settings. The optimization process involves iteratively adjusting the material distribution to minimize the maximum stress. After optimization, we evaluate the resulting design for symmetry in the x-direction. The optimized design's maximum stress (s_hat) and volume fraction (vf) are extracted, and the symmetry feature is determined.", config=ConfigFile(s_hat=120.5, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-X')), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'max_stress': 'Pass (s_y_hat=120.5000)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Pass'}, 'score': 100}
