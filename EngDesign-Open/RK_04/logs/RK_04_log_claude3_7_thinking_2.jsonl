The design domain is a 2×2 square with vertices at (-1,-1), (1,-1), (1,1), and (-1,1). It contains a vertical pre-crack from (0,0) to (0,1). Horizontal loads of magnitude 5 are applied at the top corners, pulling outward. The material properties are E=70000 and ν=0.3, with SIMP approach using 1e-8 as the void stiffness factor.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the maximum stress with a volume fraction constraint of 0.25. For such problems, the optimization would typically utilize the full permitted volume fraction to achieve minimum stress, so VF would be 0.25. \n\nRegarding the design symmetry, I need to assess if the optimized structure will be symmetric in the x-direction. Since both the domain geometry (including the crack) and the loading conditions are symmetric about the y-axis, the resulting optimal design should preserve this symmetry. Therefore, the design feature would be 'Symmetric-X'.\n\nFor the maximum stress (s_hat) in the optimized design, this would normally be determined through the actual optimization solution. Given the presence of a crack which creates stress concentration, combined with the volume fraction constraint of 0.25, and considering the loading pattern, a reasonable optimization outcome would yield a maximum stress value around 25.0.", config=ConfigFile(s_hat=25.0, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'max_stress': 'Partially Pass (s_y_hat=25.0000)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Pass'}, 'score': 70}
