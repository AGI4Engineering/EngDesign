We need to optimize a structure that minimizes the maximum stress while keeping the volume fraction below 0.25.\n\n2) Given the problem description:\n   - Domain is a 2×2 square centered at origin\n   - There's a vertical crack from (0,0) to (0,1)\n   - Horizontal loads of magnitude 5 are applied at the top corners\n   - Material properties: E = 70000, ν = 0.3\n   - SIMP approach with void stiffness factor 1e-8\n   - Filter radius R = 0.05×2 = 0.1\n\n3) For this type of topology optimization problem (especially with a crack and stress constraints), the optimizer would typically create a structure that:\n   - Distributes material to avoid stress concentration around the crack tip\n   - Creates load paths that transfer the forces while avoiding the crack\n   - Maintains symmetry if the loading and boundary conditions are symmetric\n\n4) Analyzing the symmetry of the problem:\n   - The domain is symmetric about the y-axis\n   - The crack is along the y-axis, so it's symmetric about the y-axis\n   - The loads are equal and opposite, which is antisymmetric about the y-axis\n\n5) Due to the antisymmetric loading but symmetric geometry and crack, the optimized structure would likely be symmetric about the x-axis. This is because the crack introduces a stress singularity that must be addressed in the same way on both sides, and the optimal way to carry the antisymmetric loads would maintain symmetry about the x-axis.\n\n6) Based on similar problems in topology optimization with stress constraints, the maximum stress (s_hat) for this kind of problem would likely be approximately 120-150 units. The volume fraction (VF) would be at or near the constraint of 0.25 since using more material generally helps reduce stress.\n\n7) For the design feature, since we have antisymmetric loading about the y-axis but a symmetric crack and domain, the optimal design would be 'Asymmetric-X' - meaning it's not symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I can provide the values for s_hat, VF, and Dsg_feature:", config=ConfigFile(s_hat=140.5, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Asymmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'max_stress': 'Partially Pass (s_y_hat=140.5000)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Fail'}, 'score': 50}
