The design domain is a square with a pre-existing crack, and loads are applied horizontally at the top corners. The material properties and SIMP method parameters are provided, which will guide the optimization process.\n\n1. **Domain and Boundary Conditions**: The domain is a square with vertices at (-1,-1), (1,-1), (1,1), and (-1,1). A crack is present from (0,0) to (0,1). Loads are applied at (-1,1) and (1,1) in the horizontal direction.\n\n2. **Material and Method**: The material has a Young's modulus of 70000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The SIMP method with a void stiffness factor of 1e-8 is used for optimization.\n\n3. **Optimization Constraints**: The volume fraction (VF) must not exceed 0.25. The filter radius and exponent are given, which will affect the material distribution.\n\n4. **Objective**: Minimize the maximum stress (s_hat) in the structure.\n\n5. **Design Feature**: After optimization, check if the design is symmetric or asymmetric in the x-direction.\n\nGiven these steps, the optimization process will yield the maximum stress, volume fraction, and design symmetry feature.", config=ConfigFile(s_hat=150.0, VF=0.25, Dsg_feature='Symmetric-X')), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'vf': 0.25, 'vf_threshold': 0.25, 'max_stress': 'Partially Pass (s_y_hat=150.0000)', 'Dsg_feature': 'Pass'}, 'score': 70}
