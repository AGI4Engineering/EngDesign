{'completion_tokens': 7239, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To solve for the joint angles θ that achieve the desired tool pose T_1in0, we use the Product of Exponentials (PoE) formula. The forward kinematics equation is T = e^{[S1]θ1} * e^{[S2]θ2} * ... * e^{[S6]θ6} * M. Given T and M, we compute T_target = T * inv(M). However, solving the inverse kinematics for a 6-DOF robot analytically is complex. Using numerical methods (e.g., Newton-Raphson) with the spatial screw axes S and initial guesses, we iteratively adjust θ to minimize the error between the current and target poses.
