This is a typical inverse kinematics problem.\n\n1. **Understand the Given Data:**\n   - We have the transformation matrix M_1in0 which represents the initial pose of the tool with respect to the base frame.\n   - The matrix of spatial screw axes S provides the screw axes for each joint in the space frame.\n   - The goal pose T_1in0 is the desired pose of the tool with respect to the base frame.\n\n2. **Inverse Kinematics Approach:**\n   - The task is to find the joint angles that will transform the initial pose M_1in0 to the desired pose T_1in0 using the given screw axes.\n   - We can use the product of exponentials formula for forward kinematics, which is given by:\n     \\[ T(\\theta) = e^{[S_1] \\theta_1} e^{[S_2] \\theta_2} \\cdots e^{[S_6] \\theta_6} M \\]\n   - The inverse kinematics problem involves solving for θ such that:\n     \\[ T(\\theta) = T_{1in0} \\]\n\n3. **Numerical Solution:**\n   - Since this is a non-linear equation, we typically use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or optimization techniques to solve for θ.\n   - These methods iteratively adjust the joint angles to minimize the error between the current pose and the desired pose.\n\n4. **Implementation:**\n   - Implementing this requires setting up the equations and using a numerical solver to find the joint angles.\n   - The solution will provide a set of joint angles that achieve the desired pose.\n\n5. **Result:**\n   - The result will be a list of joint angles θ = [θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, θ5, θ6] that achieve the desired pose T_1in0.', config=ConfigFile(theta=[0.5, 1.2, -0.7, 0.3, 1.1, -0.4])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'score': 0.0, 'T_1in0': matlab.double([[-0.49365096535004666,-0.7189195401003687,0.48934999670056345,-9.266784979615476],[0.857773042386533,-0.3097902675363898,0.41018946585045696,0.5813539625771593],[-0.14329735574642732,0.6222416612551802,0.7695980657684084,-2.8588882722855145],[0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0]])}, 'score': 0.0}
