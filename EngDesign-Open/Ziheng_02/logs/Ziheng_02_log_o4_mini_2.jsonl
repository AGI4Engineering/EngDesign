The steps are as follows:\n\n1.  Parse the data:\n    •  Home configuration M =\n       [ 0   0   1  −8;\n         1   0   0   2;\n         0   1   0   0;\n         0   0   0   1 ]\n    •  Goal pose T_goal =\n       [ −0.5429   0.5940   0.5937  −9.3919;\n          0.6499  −0.1506   0.7449  −1.8656;\n          0.5319   0.7903  −0.3043   0.6739;\n          0        0        0        1      ]\n    •  Spatial screw axes S1…S6 are the columns of\n       S = [\n         0   1    0   0  −1   0;\n         0   0    0   1   0   1;\n         0   0   −1   0   0   0;\n         0   0    2   0   0   0;\n         1   0   −4   0   0   0;\n         0   0    0  −6   0  −8\n       ]\n       so that each Si = [ω_i; v_i].  Note joints with ω=0 are prismatic, others are revolute.\n\n2.  Set up the inverse kinematics problem:\n    Define the end-effector configuration error function\n\n       E(θ) = logm(T(θ)^{-1} T_goal)\n\n    where logm is the matrix logarithm mapping an element of SE(3) to its se(3) twist vector.\n\n3.  Use an iterative solver (e.g. Newton–Raphson or Levenberg–Marquardt) with Jacobian\n\n       J(θ) = [Ad_{e^{−[S6]θ6}…e^{−[S2]θ2}} S1, …, S6]\n\n    to update θ ← θ + J(θ)^+ error, until ∥error∥ is below a small tolerance (e.g. 1e−6).\n\n4.  Initialize θ^(0) with a reasonable guess (e.g. zeros), iterate 10–20 times until convergence.\n\n5.
