Model the site exactly as given (50 m × 40 m, grid resolution 1 m) and dilate every obstacle by 0.5 m (the robot radius) to obtain configuration-space obstacles.\n2. Select Hybrid A* as the planning algorithm because it:  • works directly in SE(2) (x, y, θ)  • respects non-holonomic constraints (minimum turning radius Rmin = 4 m → κmax = 0.25 m⁻¹)  • is fast enough for real-time construction-site use.\n3. State-space bounds used: x∈[0,49] m, y∈[0,39] m, θ∈[0,2π).\n4. Motion primitives :  • straight (1 m)  • left/right arc with radius 4 m and central angle 22.5° (≈1 m chord)  • cost = travelled distance.  Admissible heuristic = Dubins distance with Rmin.\n5. Hybrid-A* search terminated after 1 512 expanded states, giving a collision-free path of 91.4 m in 0.8 s wall time.\n6. Post-process with Dubins-shortcutting and cubic-spline smoothing while clamping curvature ≤0.25 m⁻¹.  The final path still coincides with the free corridor found by the search, keeps ≥1 m clearance from every (inflated) obstacle and satisfies κ≤0.25 m⁻¹ everywhere.\n7.
