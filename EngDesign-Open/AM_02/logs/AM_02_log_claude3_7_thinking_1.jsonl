Let me approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, let me understand the constraints:\n- Two robots of size 2x2\n- Three static rectangular obstacles\n- Three moving pedestrians of size 2x2\n- Max speed of 2 units per time step in either direction\n- Need to plan from t=0 to t=19\n\nRobot 1 needs to move from (17, 2) to (5, 24), and Robot 2 from (5, 25) to (25, 25).\n\nFor collision detection, I'll consider that a robot at position (rx, ry) occupies a 2x2 square from (rx, ry) to (rx+1, ry+1). A collision occurs if this overlaps with any obstacle or pedestrian.\n\nFor Robot 1, I need to move northwest while avoiding the obstacles. The main challenge is navigating around obstacle 3 ((15, 5), (30, 10)) which is directly in the path. I'll first move west staying below this obstacle, then move north, and finally approach the destination from the east.\n\nFor Robot 2, I need to move east while avoiding obstacle 2 ((10, 20), (20, 30)). I'll move south first to go under this obstacle, then east, and finally north to reach the destination.\n\nI'll verify each position to ensure there are no collisions with static obstacles or pedestrians at each time step, and that the robots don't move more than 2 units in any direction per time step.", config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory1=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=15, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=13, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=11, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=9, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=9, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=9, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=9, y=8), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=9, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=9, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=9, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=9, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=9, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=9, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=9, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=8, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=7, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=6, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=5, y=24)], robot_trajectory2=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=5, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=7, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=9, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=9, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=9, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=9, y=19), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=9, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=11, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=13, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=15, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=17, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=19, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=21, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=21, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=21, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=21, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=21, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=23, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=25, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=25, y=25)])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'robot1: Start position correct': True, 'robot1: End position correct': True, 'robot1: Number of collisions with static obstacles': 2, 'robot1: Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'robot1: Over Speed limit': False, 'robot2: Start position correct': True, 'robot2: End position correct': True, 'robot2: Number of collisions with static obstacles': 4, 'robot2: Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'robot2: Over Speed limit': False}, 'score': 75.0}
