{'completion_tokens': 7557, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Step-by-step design\n1. Static obstacles:\n   • Obs1  (5–7, 0–15)\n   • Obs2  (10–20, 20–30)\n   • Obs3  (15–30, 5–10)\n   Obstacles are treated as closed rectangles that occupy every 1×1 grid cell inside the range.  Robots and pedestrians all occupy two consecutive cells in x and y, i.e. the square [x , x+2) × [y , y+2).\n2. Pedestrians (all 2×2) are given for every second t = 0 … 19.\n3. Kinematic limit: |Δx| ≤ 2 and |Δy| ≤ 2 per second for each robot.\n4. Path planning philosophy\n   • Robot-1 must go from (17,2) to (5,24).  The safest corridor is: slide left under Obs-3, climb in the free gap between Obs-1 and Obs-3, cross above Obs-1 (y ≥ 16), then reach the goal column x = 5 and climb to the final height.\n   • Robot-2 must go from (5,25) to (25,25).  Because Obs-2 blocks the direct top path, it first descends below y = 18, goes right under Obs-2, then climbs back to y = 25 once x > 20.\n5. Collision checks (done for every t):\n   • Robots never step inside any obstacle rectangles (their 2×2 footprints are always outside obstacles).\n   • Distances to all pedestrians were compared time-step-wise; the 2×2 squares never overlap.\n   • Inter-robot interference was also tested – their squares are always disjoint.\n6. Speed check: every consecutive tuple satisfies |Δx| ≤ 2 and |Δy| ≤ 2.\n7. The resulting trajectories therefore meet every requirement (start/goal, 20 samples, dynamic/static safety, speed limit).\n', config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory1=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=15, y=3), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=13, y=5), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=12, y=7), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=11, y=9), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=10, y=11), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=9, y=13), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=8, y=15), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=7, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=5, y=19), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=5, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=5, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=5, y=24)], robot_trajectory2=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=5, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=5, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=5, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=5, y=19), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=5, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=7, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=9, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=11, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=13, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=15, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=17, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=19, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=21, y=17), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=23, y=19), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=25, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=25, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=25, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=25, y=25)])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'robot1: Start position correct': True, 'robot1: End position correct': True, 'robot1: Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'robot1: Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'robot1: Over Speed limit': False, 'robot2: Start position correct': True, 'robot2: End position correct': True, 'robot2: Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'robot2: Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'robot2: Over Speed limit': False}, 'score': 100.0}
