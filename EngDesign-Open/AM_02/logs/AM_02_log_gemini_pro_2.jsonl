{'completion_tokens': 2633, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="The task is to navigate two robots in a 30x30 grid with static obstacles and moving pedestrians while respecting speed limits. Robots and pedestrians are 2x2 units.\n\n1. Environment and Constraints:\n   - Grid: 30x30, origin (0,0) bottom-left.\n   - Static Obstacles (SO, defined by [x1,x2) x [y1,y2)):\n     - SO1: [5,7) x [0,15)\n     - SO2: [10,20) x [20,30)\n     - SO3: [15,30) x [5,10)\n   - Pedestrians: 3 pedestrians with trajectories for t=0 to t=19.\n   - Robots: 2x2 size. Speed limit: |dx| <= 2, |dy| <= 2 per time step (1 second).\n     - Robot 1 (R1): Start (17,2), End (5,24).\n     - Robot 2 (R2): Start (5,25), End (25,25).\n   - Collision: A robot at (rx,ry) occupies [rx,rx+2)x[ry,ry+2). Collision with another object (pedestrian or obstacle) if their occupied regions overlap. This is equivalent to |rx-ox| < 2 AND |ry-oy| < 2 for an object of the same size at (ox,oy).\n   - Grid boundaries: Robot's (rx,ry) must be 0 <= rx <= 28 and 0 <= ry <= 28, as they are 2x2, so rx+1 and ry+1 must be <= 29.\n\n2. Pathfinding Strategy:\n   Paths were manually planned to avoid obstacles and pedestrians, then verified. The paths consist of 20 points from t=0 to t=19.\n\n   Robot 1 Trajectory: (17,2) -> (5,24)\n   - Initial state: (17,2) at t=0.\n   - Strategy: Move left to get west of SO3's x-range. Then move up to pass SO1's y-range. Then move left to get west of SO1 and SO2's x-ranges. Finally, move up to the target y-coordinate.\n   - Path Details (coordinates are (x,y)):\n     t=0: (17,2)\n     t=1: (15,2) (Move left, dx=-2. Clear of SO3 which is y in [5,10)).\n     t=2: (13,2) (Move left, dx=-2. Now west of SO3's x-range [15,30)).\n     t=3-9: Sequentially move up to (13,16). (e.g., (13,4), (13,6)...(13,16)). At (13,16), robot occupies [13,15)x[16,18), which is above SO1's y-range [0,15).\n     t=10-13: Sequentially move left to (5,16). (e.g., (11,16), (9,16)...(5,16)). At (5,16), robot occupies [5,7)x[16,18). This x-range matches SO1 but y-range is above. It is west of SO2's x-range [10,20).\n     t=14-17: Sequentially move up to (5,24). (e.g., (5,18), (5,20)...(5,24)). Reached destination (5,24).\n     t=18-19: Stay at (5,24).\n\n   Robot 2 Trajectory: (5,25) -> (25,25)\n   - Initial state: (5,25) at t=0.\n   - Strategy: Move right until just west of SO2. Then move down to pass below SO2's y-range. Then move right until east of SO2's x-range. Then move up to target y-coordinate. Finally, move right to destination.\n   - Path Details (coordinates are (x,y)):\n     t=0: (5,25)\n     t=1: (7,25) (Move right, dx=2).\n     t=2: (8,25) (Move right, dx=1). Robot at [8,10)x[25,27) is west of SO2's x-range [10,20).\n     t=3-6: Sequentially move down to (8,18). (e.g., (8,23), (8,21)...(8,18)). At (8,18), robot occupies [8,10)x[18,20), which is below SO2's y-range [20,30).\n     t=7-12: Sequentially move right to (20,18). (e.g., (10,18), (12,18)...(20,18)). At (20,18), robot occupies [20,22)x[18,20), which is east of SO2's x-range [10,20).\n     t=13-16: Sequentially move up to (20,25). (e.g., (20,20), (20,22)...(20,25)). Reached target y-level.\n     t=17-19: Sequentially move right to (25,25). (e.g., (22,25), (24,25), (25,25)). Reached destination (25,25).\n\n3. Collision Checking:\n   - Static Obstacles: Each point in R1 and R2 trajectories was checked against SO1, SO2, SO3. The chosen paths ensure no overlap between robot bounding boxes and obstacle bounding boxes.\n   - Pedestrians: Each robot's position [rx,rx+2)x[ry,ry+2) at time t was checked against all three pedestrians' positions [px,px+2)x[py,py+2) at time t. No collisions were found (i.e., for all checks, not (|rx-px|<2 AND |ry-py|<2)).\n   - Inter-robot: R1(t) vs R2(t) was checked for all t. No collisions found.\n\n4. Verification of Constraints:\n   - Start/End positions: R1 starts at (17,2) at t=0 and ends at (5,24) at t=19. R2 starts at (5,25) at t=0 and ends at (25,25) at t=19. All correct.\n   - Speed limit: All moves (xt - x(t-1), yt - y(t-1)) have |dx| <= 2 and |dy| <= 2. Verified.\n   - Boundaries: All robot coordinates (x,y) are within [0,28], ensuring the 2x2 robot remains within the 30x30 grid. Verified.\n\nThe generated trajectories satisfy all specified conditions.", config=ConfigFile(robot_trajectory1=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=17, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=15, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=13, y=2), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=13, y=4), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=13, y=6), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=13, y=8), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=13, y=10), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=13, y=12), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=13, y=14), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=13, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=11, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=9, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=7, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=5, y=16), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=5, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=5, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=5, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=5, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=5, y=24)], robot_trajectory2=[Tuple3Int(t=0, x=5, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=1, x=7, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=2, x=8, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=3, x=8, y=23), Tuple3Int(t=4, x=8, y=21), Tuple3Int(t=5, x=8, y=19), Tuple3Int(t=6, x=8, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=7, x=10, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=8, x=12, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=9, x=14, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=10, x=16, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=11, x=18, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=12, x=20, y=18), Tuple3Int(t=13, x=20, y=20), Tuple3Int(t=14, x=20, y=22), Tuple3Int(t=15, x=20, y=24), Tuple3Int(t=16, x=20, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=17, x=22, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=18, x=24, y=25), Tuple3Int(t=19, x=25, y=25)])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'robot1: Start position correct': True, 'robot1: End position correct': True, 'robot1: Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'robot1: Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'robot1: Over Speed limit': False, 'robot2: Start position correct': True, 'robot2: End position correct': True, 'robot2: Number of collisions with static obstacles': 0, 'robot2: Number of collisions with walking pedestrians': 0, 'robot2: Over Speed limit': False}, 'score': 100.0}
