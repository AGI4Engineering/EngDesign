A Gray code sequence has the property that adjacent values differ by only one bit, which makes it useful in applications where glitches from multiple bits changing simultaneously must be avoided.\n\nThe implementation approach I'll use is:\n1. Maintain a binary counter that increments on each clock cycle\n2. Convert the binary count to Gray code using the standard formula: Gray = Binary XOR (Binary shifted right by 1)\n\nThe module needs to handle:\n- A parameterizable width (DATA_WIDTH)\n- Synchronous, active-low reset\n- Output that follows the Gray code sequence\n\nThe binary-to-Gray code conversion is done using the formula G = B ^ (B >> 1), where ^ represents the XOR operation. This ensures that consecutive Gray code values differ by exactly one bit.\n\nWhen reset is active (low), the counter resets to 0, which gives a Gray code output of 0. On each rising clock edge when not in reset, the binary counter increments, and the corresponding Gray code value is output.", code="module fifo2 #(parameter\n  DATA_WIDTH = 4\n) (\n  input clk,\n  input resetn,\n  output logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] out\n);\n  \n  // Binary counter\n  logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] binary_counter;\n  \n  always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n    if (!resetn) begin\n      // Reset counter to 0\n      binary_counter <= '0;\n    end else begin\n      // Increment counter\n      binary_counter <= binary_counter + 1'b1;\n    end\n  end\n  \n  // Convert binary to Gray code (G = B ^ (B >> 1))\n  assign out = binary_counter ^ (binary_counter >> 1);\n  \nendmodule"), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'compile_error': 'tb.sv:10: error: Unknown module type: model\n2 error(s) during elaboration.\n*** These modules were missing:\n        model referenced 1 times.\n***'}, 'score': 0}
