The evaluation is fairly straightforward. Take the response of llm as V[refresh rate, acceleration, max speed, look ahead distance] and call:
#run_simulation(v[0], v[1], v[2], v[3])
If the design met the choices, a true will be return. Otherwise, the function will return false. Hence, the evaluation is based on code and deterministic.
