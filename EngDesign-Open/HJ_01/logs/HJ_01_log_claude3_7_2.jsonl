Stay within 1 meter of the track\n3. Keep the total cost under $300\n\nLet's first understand the costs:\n- Refresh rate: $5/Hz\n- Acceleration: $10/(m/s²)\n- Max velocity: $8/(m/s)\n- Lookahead distance: $1/meter\n\nFor completing the track in under 10 seconds, I need to ensure the car can achieve sufficient speed. Let's consider the basic kinematics:\n\nTo travel 56 meters in 10 seconds, the average velocity must be at least 56/10 = 5.6 m/s. However, the car starts from zero, so the max velocity should be higher to achieve this average.\n\nIf we assume constant acceleration to a max velocity and then maintaining that velocity:\ns = 0.5 * a * t₁² + v_max * (t_total - t₁)\nwhere t₁ is the time to reach max velocity (t₁ = v_max/a)\n\nLet's choose reasonable values:\n- Acceleration: 3 m/s² (cost: $30)\n- Max velocity: 8 m/s (cost: $64)\n\nWith these values, the car would reach max velocity in t₁ = 8/3 = 2.67 seconds, and cover s₁ = 0.5 * 3 * 2.67² = 10.67 meters during acceleration. The remaining distance (56 - 10.67 = 45.33 meters) would be covered at max velocity, taking t₂ = 45.33/8 = 5.67 seconds. Total time: 2.67 + 5.67 = 8.34 seconds, which is under 10 seconds.\n\nFor staying within 1 meter of the track, a good lookahead distance and refresh rate are important:\n- Lookahead distance: 5 meters (cost: $5) - A moderate lookahead helps anticipate turns\n- Refresh rate: 40 Hz (cost: $200) - A high refresh rate ensures rapid corrections\n\nTotal cost: $30 + $64 + $5 + $200 = $299, which is under the $300 budget.\n\nThese values should allow the car to complete the track in under 10 seconds while staying within 1 meter of the track path.", config=ConfigFile(refresh_rate=40, acceleration=3.0, max_velocity=8.0, lookahead_distance=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'total_cost': None, 'total_time': None, 'off_track_error': 1.074165501246348, 'cost': 299.0}, 'score': 0}
