{'completion_tokens': 568, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To solve this task, we need to configure the car's parameters such that it meets the constraints of runtime, off-track error, and budget. Let's break down the requirements and constraints:\n\n1. **Total Runtime < 10 sec**: The car needs to complete a 56-meter track in less than 10 seconds. This implies that the average speed should be at least 5.6 m/s (since 56 meters / 10 seconds = 5.6 m/s).\n\n2. **Max Off-Track Error < 1 meter**: This requires precise control, which can be influenced by the refresh rate and lookahead distance. A higher refresh rate and appropriate lookahead distance can help maintain the car on track.\n\n3. **Budget Cost < 300 dollars**: The costs are as follows:\n   - Refresh rate: 5 dollars per Hz\n   - Acceleration: 10 dollars per m/s²\n   - Max velocity: 8 dollars per m/s\n   - Lookahead distance: 1 dollar per meter\n\nTo meet these constraints, we need to balance the parameters. Let's start with a reasonable configuration:\n\n- **Max Velocity**: Set to 6 m/s. This is slightly above the average speed needed (5.6 m/s) to ensure the car can complete the track in time, allowing for acceleration and deceleration phases.\n\n- **Acceleration**: Set to 2 m/s². This allows the car to reach its max velocity quickly without excessive cost.\n\n- **Refresh Rate**: Set to 20 Hz. A higher refresh rate allows for better control and precision, reducing the off-track error.\n\n- **Lookahead Distance**: Set to 5 meters. This is a moderate distance that allows the car to anticipate the track ahead without excessive cost.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost:\n- Refresh rate cost: 20 Hz * 5 dollars/Hz = 100 dollars\n- Acceleration cost: 2 m/s² * 10 dollars/m/s² = 20 dollars\n- Max velocity cost: 6 m/s * 8 dollars/m/s = 48 dollars\n- Lookahead distance cost: 5 meters * 1 dollar/meter = 5 dollars\n\nTotal cost = 100 + 20 + 48 + 5 = 173 dollars, which is within the budget.\n\nThis configuration should allow the car to complete the track in under 10 seconds, maintain a max off-track error of less than 1 meter, and stay within the budget of 300 dollars.", config=ConfigFile(refresh_rate=20, acceleration=2.0, max_velocity=6.0, lookahead_distance=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'total_cost': None, 'total_time': None, 'off_track_error': 1.1148661529272055, 'cost': 173.0}, 'score': 0}
