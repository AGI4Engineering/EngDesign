To provide some margin, we target a total time around 8.4 s (leaving 1.6 s buffer).  \n2. We choose a max velocity v_max of 7.5 m/s.  \n   - Time to cruise distance at 7.5 m/s if reached instantly: 56 m ÷ 7.5 m/s ≈ 7.47 s (well under 10 s).  \n3. To reach 7.5 m/s quickly, pick acceleration a = 4 m/s².  \n   - Time to accelerate to 7.5 m/s: t₁ = v_max / a = 7.5 / 4 = 1.875 s.  \n   - Distance covered during acceleration: d₁ = 0.5·a·t₁² = 0.5·4·(1.875)² ≈ 7.03 m.  \n   - Remaining distance: 56 − 7.03 = 48.97 m at constant speed.  \n   - Time to cover remaining distance at 7.5 m/s: t₂ = 48.97 / 7.5 ≈ 6.53 s.  \n   - Total time: t₁ + t₂ ≈ 1.875 + 6.53 = 8.405 s (<10 s target).  \n4. To keep the max off‐track error under 1 m, we need sufficiently frequent control updates and a short look‐ahead:  \n   - Refresh rate: 25 Hz provides 40 ms update intervals, balancing cost and responsiveness.  \n   - Lookahead distance: 2 m gives the controller modest preview without over-smoothing.  \n5. Cost calculation:  \n   - Refresh rate: 25 Hz × 5 $/Hz = 125 $  \n   - Acceleration: 4 m/s² × 10 $/ (m/s²) = 40 $  \n   - Max velocity: 7.5 m/s × 8 $/ (m/s) = 60 $  \n   - Lookahead: 2 m × 1 $/m = 2 $  \n   - Total cost = 125 + 40 + 60 + 2 = 227 $, which is under the 300 $ budget.  \n6.
