{'completion_tokens': 490, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To design the car setup within the given constraints, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Required Average Velocity**: The path length is 56 meters, and the car must finish in 10 seconds. Therefore, the average velocity should be at least 5.6 m/s (56m / 10s).\n\n2. **Determine Max Velocity**: To ensure the car can achieve the average velocity, the max velocity should be higher than 5.6 m/s. Let's choose 7 m/s to allow for acceleration and deceleration phases.\n   - Cost: 7 m/s * $8/m/s = $56\n\n3. **Determine Acceleration**: The car needs to reach the max velocity quickly. Assuming it takes 2 seconds to reach 7 m/s, the acceleration would be 3.5 m/s² (7 m/s / 2 s).\n   - Cost: 3.5 m/s² * $10/m/s² = $35\n\n4. **Determine Refresh Rate**: A higher refresh rate ensures better tracking. Let's choose 20 Hz to balance cost and performance.\n   - Cost: 20 Hz * $5/Hz = $100\n\n5. **Determine Lookahead Distance**: A reasonable lookahead distance is needed to avoid overshooting. Let's choose 5 meters.\n   - Cost: 5 m * $1/m = $5\n\n6. **Check Total Cost**: $56 (max velocity) + $35 (acceleration) + $100 (refresh rate) + $5 (lookahead) = $196, which is under the $300 budget.\n\n7. **Verify Constraints**:\n   - **Runtime**: With the chosen parameters, the car can achieve the required average velocity and finish within 10 seconds.\n   - **Off-track Error**: A lookahead distance of 5 meters and a refresh rate of 20 Hz should keep the off-track error under 1 meter.\n   - **Budget**: $196 is well under $300.", config=ConfigFile(refresh_rate=20, acceleration=3.5, max_velocity=7.0, lookahead_distance=5.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'total_cost': None, 'total_time': None, 'off_track_error': 1.157839827611886, 'cost': 196.0}, 'score': 0}
