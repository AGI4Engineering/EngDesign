{'completion_tokens': 458, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To solve this task, we need to configure the car's parameters such that it meets the constraints of runtime, off-track error, and budget. Let's break down the requirements and constraints:\n\n1. **Total Runtime < 10 sec**: The car needs to complete a 56-meter track in less than 10 seconds. This means the average speed must be greater than 5.6 m/s.\n\n2. **Max Off-Track Error < 1 meter**: This requires precise control, which can be influenced by the refresh rate and lookahead distance.\n\n3. **Budget Cost < 300 dollars**: We need to calculate the cost based on the given rates:\n   - Refresh rate: 5 dollars/Hz\n   - Acceleration: 10 dollars/m/s²\n   - Max velocity: 8 dollars/m/s\n   - Lookahead distance: 1 dollar/meter\n\n### Configuration:\n- **Refresh Rate**: A higher refresh rate allows for more frequent updates, improving control precision. However, it increases cost. A reasonable starting point is 20 Hz, costing 100 dollars.\n\n- **Acceleration**: To reach the required speed quickly, a moderate acceleration of 5 m/s² is chosen, costing 50 dollars.\n\n- **Max Velocity**: To ensure the car can maintain a high speed, a max velocity of 8 m/s is chosen, costing 64 dollars.\n\n- **Lookahead Distance**: A lookahead distance of 10 meters is chosen to balance between control precision and cost, costing 10 dollars.\n\n### Cost Calculation:\n- Total cost = (20 Hz * 5 dollars/Hz) + (5 m/s² * 10 dollars/m/s²) + (8 m/s * 8 dollars/m/s) + (10 meters * 1 dollar/meter)\n- Total cost = 100 + 50 + 64 + 10 = 224 dollars\n\nThis configuration meets the budget constraint and is expected to satisfy the runtime and off-track error requirements.", config=ConfigFile(refresh_rate=20, acceleration=5.0, max_velocity=8.0, lookahead_distance=10.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'total_cost': None, 'total_time': None, 'off_track_error': 1.069503627902081, 'cost': 224.0}, 'score': 0}
