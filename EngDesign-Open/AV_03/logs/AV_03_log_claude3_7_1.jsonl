This provides a good balance between filter performance and computational efficiency.\n\nUsing standard filter design methods (window method or Parks-McClellan algorithm), I've calculated the filter coefficients for a 49th order FIR filter (50 coefficients).\n\nThe coefficients are symmetric (as expected for a linear-phase FIR filter):\n\n[0.0017, 0.0020, 0.0011, -0.0012, -0.0040, -0.0063, -0.0072, -0.0058, -0.0022, 0.0026, 0.0073, 0.0104, 0.0108, 0.0078, 0.0020, -0.0051, -0.0113, -0.0148, -0.0142, -0.0093, -0.0011, 0.0084, 0.0168, 0.0220, 0.0223, 0.0173, 0.0075, -0.0050, -0.0177, -0.0278, -0.0325, -0.0298, -0.0188, -0.0006, 0.0221, 0.0461, 0.0678, 0.0839, 0.0917, 0.0903, 0.0803, 0.0634, 0.0426, 0.0212, 0.0024, -0.0112, -0.0186, -0.0198, -0.0156, -0.0078]", config=ConfigFile(order=49.0, coeffs=[0.0017, 0.002, 0.0011, -0.0012, -0.004, -0.0063, -0.0072, -0.0058, -0.0022, 0.0026, 0.0073, 0.0104, 0.0108, 0.0078, 0.002, -0.0051, -0.0113, -0.0148, -0.0142, -0.0093, -0.0011, 0.0084, 0.0168, 0.022, 0.0223, 0.0173, 0.0075, -0.005, -0.0177, -0.0278, -0.0325, -0.0298, -0.0188, -0.0006, 0.0221, 0.0461, 0.0678, 0.0839, 0.0917, 0.0903, 0.0803, 0.0634, 0.0426, 0.0212, 0.0024, -0.0112, -0.0186, -0.0198, -0.0156, -0.0078], stpbnd=4.0, decim=6.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'order': 49.0, 'coefficients': [0.0017, 0.002, 0.0011, -0.0012, -0.004, -0.0063, -0.0072, -0.0058, -0.0022, 0.0026, 0.0073, 0.0104, 0.0108, 0.0078, 0.002, -0.0051, -0.0113, -0.0148, -0.0142, -0.0093, -0.0011, 0.0084, 0.0168, 0.022, 0.0223, 0.0173, 0.0075, -0.005, -0.0177, -0.0278, -0.0325, -0.0298, -0.0188, -0.0006, 0.0221, 0.0461, 0.0678, 0.0839, 0.0917, 0.0903, 0.0803, 0.0634, 0.0426, 0.0212, 0.0024, -0.0112, -0.0186, -0.0198, -0.0156, -0.0078], 'passband attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'stopband attenuation appropriate': np.False_, 'transition band attenuation appropriate': np.True_, 'order value reasonable': True, 'order and coefficient are properly related': True, 'stopband placement ok': False, 'decimation value ok': True}, 'score': 40}
