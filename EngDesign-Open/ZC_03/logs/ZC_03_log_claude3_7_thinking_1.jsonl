{'completion_tokens': 38886, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='I analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the objective function J = E[√R_T] · E[Δ̂_T] that balances regret and ATE estimation error. First, I examined the regret, which has contributions from both the exploration phase (≈ K^α L^β) and the exploitation phase (≈ √(K^2L - K^(α+1)L^β)). The ATE estimation error is approximately K^(-α/2+1/2)L^(-β/2), based on the uniform pulls during exploration.\n\nI identified two regimes: when exploitation dominates (K^α L^β << K·L^(1/2)), J ≈ K^(1-α/2)·L^(1/4-β/2); and when exploration dominates (K^α L^β >> K·L^(1/2)), J ≈ K^(1/2). The transition between these regimes occurs along the boundary where K^α L^β = K·L^(1/2).\n\nThe partial derivatives of J with respect to α and β in the exploitation-dominated regime are negative, indicating J decreases as α and β increase. In the exploration-dominated regime, J is constant. Therefore, J is minimized along the boundary where the two regimes meet, which gives us β = 1/2 + (1-α)/(log L/log K).\n\nSolving for the optimal values along this boundary, I found that when α = 1, β = 1/2; and when β = 1/2, α = 1. These specific values represent the unique point where J achieves its minimum value among all possible combinations in the feasible set S.', config=ConfigFile(bar_alpha=1.0, under_linealpha=1.0, bar_beta=0.5, under_linebeta=0.5)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'bar_alpha': 1.0, 'bar_beta': 0.5, 'underline_alpha': 1.0, 'underline_beta': 0.5}, 'score': 75.0}
