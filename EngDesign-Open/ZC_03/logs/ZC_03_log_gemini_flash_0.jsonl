{"completion_tokens": 1154, "response": "reasoning='The objective function to be minimized is \\\\(J = \\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\sqrt{R_T}] \\\\cdot \\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\hat{\\\\Delta}_T]\\\\). The regret \\\\(R_T\\\\) is bounded by \\\\(T\\\\) during the exploration phase and grows at a rate dependent on the gap between optimal and suboptimal arms during the exploitation phase. The ATE estimation error \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\Delta}_T\\\\) decreases as \\\\(O(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\log(T)}{n}})\\\\), where \\\\(n\\\\) is the number of pulls of each arm during the exploration phase.  The exploration phase duration is \\\\(K^{\\\\alpha} L^{\\\\beta}\\\\). \\n\\nDuring the exploration phase, each arm is pulled approximately \\\\(K^{\\\\alpha-1}L^{\\\\beta}\\\\) times. Thus, the ATE estimation error can be approximated as \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\Delta}_T \\\\approx O(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{K^{\\\\alpha-1}L^{\\\\beta}}}) = O(K^{(1-\\\\alpha)/2}L^{-\\\\beta/2})\\\\).  The regret during the exploration phase is bounded by \\\\(K^{\\\\alpha} L^{\\\\beta}\\\\). The regret during the exploitation phase is optimized when the exploration phase is appropriately chosen, which often leads to a polylogarithmic regret.  Therefore, \\\\(\\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\sqrt{R_T}] \\\\approx O(\\\\sqrt{K^{\\\\alpha} L^{\\\\beta}}) = O(K^{\\\\alpha/2}L^{\\\\beta/2})\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, to minimize \\\\(J\\\\), we want to minimize \\\\(J \\\\approx O(K^{\\\\alpha/2}L^{\\\\beta/2}) \\\\cdot O(K^{(1-\\\\alpha)/2}L^{-\\\\beta/2}) = O(K^{\\\\alpha/2 + (1-\\\\alpha)/2}L^{\\\\beta/2 - \\\\beta/2}) = O(K^{1/2})\\\\).  This suggests that the objective function \\\\(J\\\\) is independent of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\).\\nSince \\\\( 1 \\\\le K^{\\\\alpha}L^{\\\\beta} \\\\le T = LK \\\\), we have \\\\( K^{\\\\alpha}L^{\\\\beta} = LK \\\\), which gives \\\\( \\\\alpha = 1, \\\\beta = 1 \\\\).\\n\\nThe condition \\\\( 1 \\\\le K^{\\\\alpha}L^{\\\\beta} \\\\le T \\\\) implies that \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) can vary, but the minimum \\\\(J(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)\\\\) is constant, as shown above.\\n\\nTherefore, \\\\( \\\\bar{\\\\alpha} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\underline{\\\\alpha} \\\\) can be 1 and 0 respectively, and \\\\( \\\\bar{\\\\beta} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\underline{\\\\beta} \\\\) can be 1 and 0 respectively under the assumption that the constraint \\\\( K^{\\\\alpha}L^{\\\\beta} <= T \\\\) holds.\\nGiven the condition \\\\(1 \\\\le K^{\\\\alpha}L^{\\\\beta} \\\\le T = LK\\\\), we need to determine the feasible ranges for \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\). Taking the logarithm base K, we have\\n\\\\[\\n0 \\\\le \\\\alpha + \\\\beta \\\\frac{\\\\log L}{\\\\log K} \\\\le 1 + \\\\frac{\\\\log L}{\\\\log K}\\n\\\\]\\nIf \\\\(L > 1, K > 1 \\\\), then \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\log L}{\\\\log K} > 0 \\\\).
