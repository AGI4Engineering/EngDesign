Whenever a conflict occurred the F value was moved to the nearest boundary that still belongs to its own stratum, so the LHS property was preserved while satisfying the constraint.\n   The resulting (N,F) pairs are listed below; they all respect F≤−0.0625·N+300 when N≤2000.\n\nTask 3:  For N = 1900 rpm the normalised factor is\n   f = (1900−1600)/(2200−1600) = 300/600 = 0.5.\n   Interpolated limits:\n   • P_range = (1−0.5)[90,120] + 0.5[110,160] = [100,140] MPa\n   • G_range = (1−0.5)[0.2,0.4] + 0.5[0.6,0.9] = [0.4,0.65] ratio\n\nTask 4:  With global point (N,F) = (1900,110) and the bounds above, 30 local LHS samples were generated for the four local inputs:\n   • S ∈ [−9, 3] deg\u2003(step 0.4 deg)\n   • P ∈ [100, 140] MPa\u2003(step 1.333 MPa)\n   • G ∈ [0.4, 0.65]\u2003\u2003(step 0.00833)\n   • E ∈ [0.5, 5] mm\u2003(step 0.15 mm)\n   Independent random permutations of the 30 strata for every variable guarantee the Latin-hypercube property while every point complies with its respective bounds.\n\nAll requested objects are reported below in the required JSON structure.', config=ConfigFile(constraint_parameters=[-0.0625, 300.0], global_design_points=[[1620.0, 110.0], [1660.0, 26.0], [1700.0, 170.0], [1740.0, 50.0], [1780.0, 188.0], [1820.0, 62.0], [1860.0, 134.0], [1900.0, 146.0], [1940.0, 74.0], [1980.0, 176.0], [2020.0, 38.0], [2060.0, 158.0], [2100.0, 122.0], [2140.0, 86.0], [2180.0, 98.0]], normalized_speed_factor=0.5, P_range=[100.0, 140.0], G_range=[0.4, 0.65], local_design_points=[[-2.8, 106.0, 0.4958, 2.525], [-7.6, 123.3333, 0.4375, 0.725], [0.8, 100.6667, 0.6042, 4.475], [-4.8, 132.6667, 0.4625, 3.425], [2.8, 139.3333, 0.6458, 1.325], [-5.6, 108.6667, 0.4542, 2.675], [-8.8, 115.3333, 0.4125, 3.725], [-1.2, 138.0, 0.5708, 1.775], [-4.0, 102.0, 0.5208, 4.925], [2.0, 131.3333, 0.4208, 0.875], [-6.8, 119.3333, 0.4792, 4.175], [-0.4, 103.3333, 0.5292, 2.225], [-2.0, 112.6667, 0.5792, 2.975], [-8.4, 134.0, 0.6375, 2.375], [1.2, 114.0, 0.4042, 3.125], [-6.4, 135.3333, 0.5458, 0.575], [-1.6, 107.3333, 0.4458, 4.775], [-3.6, 128.6667, 0.5875, 1.625], [-5.2, 110.0, 0.6208, 1.025], [-7.2, 124.6667, 0.5042, 4.025], [0.4, 118.0, 0.4292, 1.475], [-4.4, 104.6667, 0.4875, 4.325], [-3.2, 127.3333, 0.5542, 3.575], [-2.4, 120.6667, 0.6125, 1.925], [2.4, 116.6667, 0.5125, 2.075], [-6.0, 130.0, 0.5625, 3.875], [0.0, 136.6667, 0.4708, 1.175], [-0.8, 122.0, 0.5958, 3.275], [1.6, 126.0, 0.6292, 4.625], [-8.0, 111.3333, 0.5375, 2.825]])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'detailed information': "Global input constraints in Task 1 are calculated correctly.\nSampling of global inputs gained from Task 2 satisfies constraints.\nThe sampling points of the global inputs gained from Task 2 satisfy the LHS sampling principle (LHS divides each variable's range into N intervals and ensures each sample uses a unique interval per dimension for uniform coverage).\nnormalized_speed_factor in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nP_range in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nG_range in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nThe sampling points of the local inputs gained from Task 4 satisfy the LHS sampling principle (LHS divides each variable's range into N intervals and ensures each sample uses a unique interval per dimension for uniform coverage).", 'total_score': 100}, 'score': 100}
