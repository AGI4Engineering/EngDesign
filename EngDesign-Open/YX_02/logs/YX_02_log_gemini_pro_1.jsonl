I will address each task to derive the required values and then structure them into the specified JSON format.\n\nTask 1: Determine the linear relationship F_max = a * N + b.\nGiven points: (N1, F1) = (1600, 200) and (N2, F2) = (2000, 175).\nSlope 'a' = (F2 - F1) / (N2 - N1) = (175 - 200) / (2000 - 1600) = -25 / 400 = -0.0625.\nIntercept 'b': Using F_max = a * N + b and (1600, 200):\n200 = -0.0625 * 1600 + b\n200 = -100 + b\nb = 300.\nSo, F_max = -0.0625 * N + 300. The constraint parameters are [a, b].\n\nTask 2: Generate 15 LHS global design points [N, F].\nN range: [1600, 2200]. F range: [20, 200].\nConstraint: If 1600 <= N <= 2000, F <= -0.0625 * N + 300. Otherwise (N > 2000), F <= 200 (general F limit).\nLHS requires sampling such that each variable's range is divided into strata, and one sample is drawn from each stratum. For N, 15 strata are formed over [1600, 2200]. For F, 15 strata are formed over its valid range for each N.\nN values are chosen as midpoints of these strata: [1620, 1660, ..., 2180].\nFor F values, normalized LHS coefficients ( (idx+0.5)/15 for idx in 0..14 ) are generated. These coefficients are shuffled (e.g., reversed order for reproducibility) and then used to scale F within its valid dynamic range [20, F_max_constraint_for_N] for each corresponding N value.\nF_max_constraint_for_N is min(200, -0.0625*N+300) if N in [1600,2000], else 200.\n\nTask 3: Calculate normalized speed factor 'f' and interpolated P_range, G_range.\nGiven N = 1900 rpm.\n'f' = (N - 1600) / (2200 - 1600) = (1900 - 1600) / 600 = 300 / 600 = 0.5.\nP_range = (1-f)*[90,120] + f*[110,160] = 0.5*[90,120] + 0.5*[110,160] = [45,60] + [55,80] = [100,140].\nG_range = (1-f)*[0.2,0.4] + f*[0.6,0.9] = 0.5*[0.2,0.4] + 0.5*[0.6,0.9] = [0.1,0.2] + [0.3,0.45] = [0.4,0.65].\n\nTask 4: Generate 30 local LHS design points [S, P, G, E].\nRanges:\nS: [-9, 3]\nP: [100, 140] (from Task 3)\nG: [0.4, 0.65] (from Task 3)\nE: [0.5, 5]\n30 LHS samples are generated. For each dimension (S, P, G, E), normalized LHS coefficients ( (idx+0.5)/30 for idx in 0..29 ) are generated. Four distinct permutations of these coefficients (achieved by cyclic shifts for reproducibility) are assigned to S, P, G, and E respectively. Each point (S_i, P_i, G_i, E_i) is then calculated by scaling the assigned coefficient within the variable's range.\n\nAll calculations are performed, and values are rounded to a reasonable number of decimal places (2 for F in global points, 4 for local points, 2 for P/G ranges).", config=ConfigFile(constraint_parameters=[-0.0625, 300.0], global_design_points=[[1620.0, 192.81], [1660.0, 170.87], [1700.0, 162.19], [1740.0, 140.26], [1780.0, 131.58], [1820.0, 109.65], [1860.0, 100.97], [1900.0, 79.04], [1940.0, 70.36], [1980.0, 48.43], [2020.0, 146.0], [2060.0, 98.0], [2100.0, 80.0], [2140.0, 44.0], [2180.0, 26.0]], normalized_speed_factor=0.5, P_range=[100.0, 140.0], G_range=[0.4, 0.65], local_design_points=[[-8.8, 110.0, 0.5208, 3.725], [-8.4, 111.3333, 0.5292, 3.875], [-8.0, 112.6667, 0.5375, 4.025], [-7.6, 114.0, 0.5458, 4.175], [-7.2, 115.3333, 0.5542, 4.325], [-6.8, 116.6667, 0.5625, 4.475], [-6.4, 118.0, 0.5708, 4.625], [-6.0, 100.6667, 0.5792, 4.775], [-5.6, 102.0, 0.5875, 4.925], [-5.2, 103.3333, 0.5958, 0.6125], [-4.8, 104.6667, 0.6042, 0.7625], [-4.4, 106.0, 0.6125, 0.9125], [-4.0, 107.3333, 0.6208, 1.0625], [-3.6, 108.6667, 0.6292, 1.2125], [-3.2, 100.0, 0.6375, 1.3625], [-2.8, 101.3333, 0.4042, 1.5125], [-2.4, 102.6667, 0.4125, 1.6625], [-2.0, 104.0, 0.4208, 1.8125], [-1.6, 105.3333, 0.4292, 1.9625], [-1.2, 106.6667, 0.4375, 2.1125], [-0.8, 108.0, 0.4458, 2.2625], [-0.4, 131.3333, 0.4542, 2.4125], [0.0, 132.6667, 0.4625, 2.5625], [0.4, 134.0, 0.4708, 2.7125], [0.8, 135.3333, 0.4792, 2.8625], [1.2, 136.6667, 0.4875, 3.0125], [1.6, 138.0, 0.4958, 3.1625], [2.0, 139.3333, 0.5042, 3.3125], [2.4, 109.3333, 0.5125, 3.4625], [2.8, 108.6667, 0.5125, 3.575]])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'detailed information': "Global input constraints in Task 1 are calculated correctly.\nSampling of global inputs gained from Task 2 satisfies constraints.\nThe sampling points of the global inputs gained from Task 2 don't satisfy the LHS sampling principle (LHS divides each variable's range into N intervals and ensures each sample uses a unique interval per dimension for uniform coverage).\nnormalized_speed_factor in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nP_range in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nG_range in Task 3 are calculated correctly.\nThe sampling points of the local inputs gained from Task 4 don't satisfy the LHS sampling principle (LHS divides each variable's range into N intervals and ensures each sample uses a unique interval per dimension for uniform coverage).", 'total_score': 40}, 'score': 40}
