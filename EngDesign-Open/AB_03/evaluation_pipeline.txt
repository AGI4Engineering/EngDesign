Exact code evaluation.
1. Extract solution_code from LLM response.
2. Write solution_code to a temporary python file.
3. Import the get_simplified_contours function from the temporary file.
4. Execute the function get_simplified_contours().
5. Compare the returned approximate polygon vertices and convex hull vertices against pre-calculated ground truth vertices.
6. Calculate a score based on matching the number of vertices and the IoU of the bounding boxes for both approx polygon and convex hull. Average these two comparison scores.
7. Determine pass/fail based on the final score exceeding a threshold (e.g., 95).
