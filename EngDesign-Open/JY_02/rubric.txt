There are three values that are taken into count for this multivariant loss. 
the first is Total variation loss, this loss encourages local smoothness by penalizing the sharp transitions 
the second is entropy loss, this loss is used to encourage edge probability to be confident 
the thrid loss is density loss, this encourages sparsity over the average number of pixels 
In the end the losses are weighted together, using a defined weight to combine to a loss term. 
The final score is a linear relationship as the lower the loss the higher the score
