First, let me analyze the image data to understand what I'm working with:\n   - The image is a grayscale image with 80 rows and 100 columns\n   - The intensity values range from approximately 60 to 230\n   - There are visible structures and patterns in the image, including some apparent edges\n\n2. For Gaussian smoothing, I need to choose an appropriate kernel size and sigma value:\n   - Looking at the image data, there are both fine and large-scale details\n   - I'll choose a 5x5 Gaussian kernel with sigma=1.0 as a good balance between noise reduction and edge preservation\n   - A larger kernel would blur more but might remove important edge details\n\n3. For edge detection kernels, I'll use Sobel operators which are effective for detecting edges:\n   - For X direction (horizontal edges): 3x3 kernel\n   - For Y direction (vertical edges): 3x3 kernel\n   - These are standard sizes that work well for most edge detection tasks\n\n4. For thresholds, I need to determine appropriate values to keep meaningful edges while removing noise:\n   - After examining the image data range (approximately 60-230), I'll set:\n   - Minimum threshold: 15 (edges with magnitude less than this are considered noise)\n   - Maximum threshold: 255 (this allows all strong edges to pass)\n\nThe Sobel kernels I'll use are standard 3x3 operators:\n- X direction: [[-1, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]\n- Y direction: [[-1, -2, -1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 1]]\n\nThese are chosen because they're effective at detecting edges while providing some smoothing. The Gaussian blur with sigma=1.0 will help remove high-frequency noise before edge detection, making the edges cleaner and more continuous.", config=ConfigFile(gaussian=1.0, edge_x=[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]], edge_y=[[-1.0, -2.0, -1.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0, 1.0]], maximum=255.0, minimum=15.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'edge_density': np.float64(0.0), 'num_features': 0, 'entropy': np.float64(0.0), 'total_loss': np.float64(113.48973652318165)}, 'score': np.float64(11.510263476818352)}
