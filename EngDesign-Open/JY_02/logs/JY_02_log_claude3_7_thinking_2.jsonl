{'completion_tokens': 4758, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To create an effective edge detection system, I'll follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. First, I analyzed the input image data (48x100 pixels) to understand its characteristics. The pixel values range from approximately 60 to 230, with areas of both smooth transitions and more detailed regions.\n\n2. For the Gaussian blur, I need to balance noise reduction with detail preservation:\n   - Too small a sigma would retain noise that could lead to false edges\n   - Too large a sigma would blur important features\n   - Given the moderate variations in the image and the goal of optimizing edge density/connectivity, a sigma of 1.0 is appropriate\n\n3. For edge detection kernels, I selected the standard Sobel operators:\n   - The x-direction kernel [[-1,0,1],[-2,0,2],[-1,0,1]] detects vertical edges\n   - The y-direction kernel [[-1,-2,-1],[0,0,0],[1,2,1]] detects horizontal edges\n   - These 3Ã—3 kernels provide good directional sensitivity while being computationally efficient\n\n4. For threshold values:\n   - After applying Gaussian blur and Sobel operators, edge magnitudes typically span a wide range\n   - A minimum threshold of 20 will filter out weak edges that likely represent noise\n   - A maximum threshold of 130 will exclude extremely strong edges that might be artifacts\n   - This range optimizes edge density and connectivity while maintaining high information entropy\n\nThese parameters are specifically tailored to the input image's characteristics to produce a clean edge map with well-connected, meaningful edges.", config=ConfigFile(gaussian=1.0, edge_x=[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]], edge_y=[[-1.0, -2.0, -1.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0, 1.0]], maximum=130.0, minimum=20.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'edge_density': np.float64(0.0), 'num_features': 0, 'entropy': np.float64(0.0), 'total_loss': np.float64(113.48973652318165)}, 'score': np.float64(11.510263476818352)}
