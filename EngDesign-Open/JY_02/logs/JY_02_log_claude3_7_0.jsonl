{'completion_tokens': 636, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To develop a real kernel that detects edges in the image, I need to analyze the input image, apply a Gaussian blur, design edge detection kernels, and set appropriate threshold values.\n\n1. First, let me analyze the input image to understand its characteristics:\n   - The image is a 50x100 grayscale image with pixel values ranging from approximately 60 to 230.\n   - There appear to be various structures with distinct boundaries, suggesting meaningful edges to detect.\n   - There's some natural noise and variation in the pixel values.\n\n2. For Gaussian blur:\n   - I need to choose an appropriate size for the Gaussian kernel that smooths the image without losing important edge details.\n   - A 5x5 Gaussian kernel with sigma=1.0 would be appropriate for this size of image - large enough to reduce noise but not so large that it blurs important edges.\n\n3. For edge detection kernels:\n   - I'll use Sobel-like operators which are commonly used for edge detection.\n   - For the x-direction (horizontal edges), I'll use a 3x3 kernel that detects horizontal gradients.\n   - For the y-direction (vertical edges), I'll use a 3x3 kernel that detects vertical gradients.\n   - The 3x3 size provides a good balance between sensitivity and noise-resistance for this image.\n\n4. For thresholding:\n   - Based on the pixel value range in the image, I need to set appropriate minimum and maximum values.\n   - Values that are too small will include noise, while values that are too large will miss subtle edges.\n   - After examining the image and considering typical edge strength distributions after Sobel filtering, I'll set the minimum threshold at 20 to filter out weak edges likely caused by noise.\n   - I'll set the maximum threshold at 100 to capture significant edges while excluding extreme values that might be artifacts.\n\nHere are my choices:\n- Gaussian kernel with sigma=1.0 for smoothing\n- 3x3 Sobel-like kernels for edge detection in x and y directions\n- Minimum threshold of 20 and maximum of 100 for edge filtering", config=ConfigFile(gaussian=1.0, edge_x=[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]], edge_y=[[-1.0, -2.0, -1.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0, 1.0]], maximum=100.0, minimum=20.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'edge_density': np.float64(0.0), 'num_features': 0, 'entropy': np.float64(0.0), 'total_loss': np.float64(113.48973652318165)}, 'score': np.float64(11.510263476818352)}
