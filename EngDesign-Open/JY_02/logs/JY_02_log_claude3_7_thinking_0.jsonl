{'completion_tokens': 3077, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="I need to develop an edge detection kernel for the given image. Let me analyze the image and determine the best parameters:\n\n1. First, I'll examine the image dimensions: it's a 57x100 array of grayscale values ranging roughly from 60 to 230.\n\n2. For Gaussian blur, I need a parameter that will smooth noise without losing important edge details. Looking at the image data, there are some areas with subtle transitions and others with stronger edges. A sigma value of 1.0 provides a good balance - enough smoothing to reduce noise but not so much that it blurs meaningful edges.\n\n3. For edge detection kernels, I'll use Sobel operators which are effective for detecting edges in x and y directions:\n   - For x-direction (horizontal edges): a 3x3 kernel with values [[-1,0,1],[-2,0,2],[-1,0,1]]\n   - For y-direction (vertical edges): a 3x3 kernel with values [[-1,-2,-1],[0,0,0],[1,2,1]]\n   These kernels are well-established for gradient-based edge detection and will highlight changes in intensity in both directions.\n\n4. For threshold values:\n   - Minimum threshold: 25 - This will filter out weak edges that are likely noise\n   - Maximum threshold: 180 - This will filter out extremely strong edges that might be outliers\n   These values are chosen based on analyzing the range of pixel values in the image and typical gradient magnitudes after Sobel operations.\n\nThis configuration should effectively detect meaningful edges while filtering out noise.", config=ConfigFile(gaussian=1.0, edge_x=[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]], edge_y=[[-1.0, -2.0, -1.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0, 1.0]], maximum=180.0, minimum=25.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'edge_density': np.float64(0.0), 'num_features': 0, 'entropy': np.float64(0.0), 'total_loss': np.float64(113.48973652318165)}, 'score': np.float64(11.510263476818352)}
