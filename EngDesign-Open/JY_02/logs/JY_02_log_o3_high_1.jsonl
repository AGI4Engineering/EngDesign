{'completion_tokens': 1234, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Image dimensions – the provided array corresponds to a roughly 100 × 100 single–channel (grayscale) image.  \n2. Smoothing – to reduce the visible pixel–scale noise without blurring genuine high–frequency structures too aggressively, a modest 5 × 5 Gaussian is sufficient.  (A smaller 3 × 3 filter would leave too much noise; a 7 × 7 would unnecessarily smear the comparatively small-scale edges seen in the first 30–40 rows.)  \n3. Edge detection – a pair of 3 × 3 Sobel operators delivers strong directional derivatives while keeping the kernel small enough to preserve spatial accuracy.  The kernels are square, identical in size and shape, and capture horizontal (Gx) and vertical (Gy) gradients respectively.  \n4. Expected gradient range – the Sobel Gx/Gy output can reach |1020| ( (255 + 2·255 + 255) − 0 ).  Empirically, in the given image (whose pixel values span roughly 60–235) the strongest gradients will be near 800–900, while texture / noise sits below ≈100.  \n5. Thresholds – choose a minimum gradient magnitude of 100 to discard background texture and quantisation noise, and a maximum of 1020 (theoretical Sobel peak) to keep every real edge that exists in the image data.  These two values can be used directly or inside a hysteresis scheme (high = max, low = min).', config=ConfigFile(gaussian=5.0, edge_x=[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]], edge_y=[[-1.0, -2.0, -1.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0, 1.0]], maximum=1020.0, minimum=100.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'edge_density': np.float64(0.0), 'num_features': 0, 'entropy': np.float64(0.0), 'total_loss': np.float64(68.06050498271534)}, 'score': np.float64(56.939495017284656)}
