{'completion_tokens': 359, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To detect edges in an image, we need to follow a series of steps that involve smoothing the image, applying edge detection filters, and then thresholding the results to remove noise. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Gaussian Blur**: The first step is to apply a Gaussian blur to the image. This helps in reducing noise and detail, which is essential for better edge detection. The size of the Gaussian kernel should be chosen based on the image size and the level of noise. A typical choice is a 3x3 or 5x5 kernel.\n\n2. **Edge Detection Kernels**: We need to design two kernels for detecting edges, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction. Common choices are the Sobel or Prewitt operators, which are 3x3 kernels. These kernels help in highlighting the intensity changes in the respective directions.\n\n3. **Thresholding**: After applying the edge detection filters, the resulting image will have a range of values. We need to set a minimum and maximum threshold to filter out the less significant edges (noise) and keep only the significant ones. The thresholds can be determined based on the histogram of the edge-detected image.\n\nFor this task, I will use a 3x3 Gaussian kernel for smoothing, Sobel operators for edge detection, and set thresholds based on typical values for edge detection tasks.", config=ConfigFile(gaussian=3.0, edge_x=[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]], edge_y=[[1.0, 2.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [-1.0, -2.0, -1.0]], maximum=255.0, minimum=50.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'edge_density': np.float64(0.0), 'num_features': 0, 'entropy': np.float64(0.0), 'total_loss': np.float64(84.04746922929009)}, 'score': np.float64(40.95253077070991)}
