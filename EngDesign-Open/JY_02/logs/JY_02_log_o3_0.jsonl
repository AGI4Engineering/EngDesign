Examine the image matrix – values range roughly 60-235 (low-contrast in some zones, but plenty of strong gradients around the centre and borders). 2. A light smoothing is required so that genuine step–changes remain but pixel-level noise is reduced.  A 5×5 Gaussian kernel (σ≈1.0) is a common compromise – large enough to remove single-pixel fluctuations while still preserving the width of most edges found in a <10-pixel neighbourhood.\n3. For edge extraction the classic Sobel operator (3×3) is adequate.  Its small window is sufficient after the pre-blur, and it gives strong directional response while keeping computation cheap.  The x-mask detects vertical edges whereas the y-mask detects horizontal ones; they share identical size/shape as required.\n4. Thresholds:  After Gaussian blur and Sobel filtering, gradient magnitudes |G| normally concentrate below 800 in an 8-bit image (max theoretical ≈ 1020).  Empirically, weak texture/noise gives |G| < 80, prominent edges usually exceed 150.  To pass only ‘significant’ edges while still allowing head-room for very strong ones we pick minimum = 120 and maximum = 900.\n5. These parameters are general-purpose, but tuned to the observed dynamic range and noise level of the supplied frame, meeting the requested balance between edge density, connectivity and entropy.', config=ConfigFile(gaussian=5.0, edge_x=[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]], edge_y=[[-1.0, -2.0, -1.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0, 1.0]], maximum=900.0, minimum=120.0)), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'edge_density': np.float64(0.0), 'num_features': 0, 'entropy': np.float64(0.0), 'total_loss': np.float64(68.06050498271534)}, 'score': np.float64(56.939495017284656)}
