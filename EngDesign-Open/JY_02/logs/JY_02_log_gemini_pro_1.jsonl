{'completion_tokens': 982, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The task is to define a configuration for an edge detection process. This process involves Gaussian blurring, applying directional edge filtering kernels, and thresholding the resulting edge magnitudes.\n\n1.  **Gaussian Blurring (`gaussian`)**: \n    *   Purpose: To smooth the input image and reduce noise before edge detection. This helps in obtaining cleaner and more coherent edges.\n    *   Choice: The `gaussian` parameter is interpreted as the standard deviation (sigma) of the Gaussian kernel. A sigma of `1.4` is chosen. This typically corresponds to a 5x5 kernel, providing a good balance between noise suppression and preservation of significant edge details for an image of this size (100x100) and content (a face with varying feature sharpness).\n\n2.  **Edge Filtering Kernels (`edge_x`, `edge_y`)**: \n    *   Purpose: To approximate the image gradient in the x and y directions. The magnitude of this gradient indicates edge strength.\n    *   Choice: Standard 3x3 Sobel operators are selected. These are widely used, computationally efficient, and provide good edge detection with some inherent smoothing. \n        *   `edge_x` (for vertical edges): `[[-1, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]`\n        *   `edge_y` (for horizontal edges): `[[-1, -2, -1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 1]]`\n    *   These kernels are of the same size and shape (3x3) as required.\n\n3.  **Thresholding (`minimum`, `maximum`)**: \n    *   Purpose: To distinguish significant edges from noise and non-significant details based on their computed magnitudes (G = sqrt(Gx^2 + Gy^2)).\n    *   Interpretation: The `minimum` and `maximum` values are interpreted as low and high thresholds, respectively, for a hysteresis thresholding procedure (similar to that used in the Canny edge detector). This approach is effective for producing well-defined, connected edges and is superior to simple single thresholding for balancing edge density, connectivity, and reducing isolated noisy pixels.\n        *   Edges with magnitude greater than `maximum` (high threshold) are considered strong edges.\n        *   Edges with magnitude between `minimum` (low threshold) and `maximum` are considered weak edges. Weak edges are kept only if they are connected to strong edges.\n        *   Edges with magnitude less than `minimum` are discarded as noise.\n    *   Choice for `minimum` (low_threshold): `50.0`. This value is chosen to filter out minor noise and very weak textures that are not part of the main structural features of the face. After Gaussian smoothing (sigma=1.4) and Sobel filtering, true edge gradients are expected to be above this level.\n    *   Choice for `maximum` (high_threshold): `150.0`. This value is selected to identify confidently detected edges. The ratio of high_threshold to low_threshold (150:50 = 3:1) is a common and effective choice in Canny-like algorithms. Given the input image pixel range (approx. 50-230), significant local intensity differences (e.g., 30-50 intensity units) would result in gradient magnitudes in the range of 120-200. A high threshold of 150 should capture these.\n\nThese parameters are chosen to optimize for common edge quality metrics like density (not too sparse, not too cluttered), connectivity (continuous lines for features), and entropy (meaningful edge information).', config=ConfigFile(gaussian=1.4, edge_x=[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0], [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]], edge_y=[[-1.0, -2.0, -1.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0, 1.0]], maximum=150.0, minimum=50.0)), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'edge_density': np.float64(0.0), 'num_features': 0, 'entropy': np.float64(0.0), 'total_loss': np.float64(113.48973652318165)}, 'score': np.float64(11.510263476818352)}
