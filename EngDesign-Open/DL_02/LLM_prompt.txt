# Solid-State Drive Design Task - Parmeter Set with Constraints

In this problem, you will finalize a set of Solid-State Drive (SSD) designs that meet the performance requirements for a specific workload type. In this problem, you need to identify an optimized parameter set that satisfy the given performance criteria under given constraints (e.g., the capacity constriants need the multiple of several parameters to stay in a given range).

## Background

![fig_ssd_arch](./images/ssdhardware.png)

The internal architecture of a typical SSD is presented in the above Figure. An SSD consists of five major components: a set of flash memory packages, an SSD controller having embedded processors like ARM, off-chip DRAM (SSD DRAM), flash controllers, and the I/O interface that includes SATA and NVMe protocols. The flash packages are organized in a hierarchical manner. Each SSD has multiple channels, and each channel can process read/write commands independently. Each channel is shared by multiple flash packages. Each package has multiple flash chips. Within each chip, there are multiple planes. Each plane includes multiple flash blocks, and each block has multiple flash pages. The page size varies in different SSDs. When a free flash page is written once, that page is no longer available for future writes until that page is erased. However, erase operation is expensive and performed at block granularity. As each flash block has limited endurance, it is important for blocks to age uniformly (i.e., wear leveling). Modern SSD controllers employ out-of-place write, GC, and wear leveling to overcome these shortcomings and maintain indirections for the address translation in their flash translation layer (FTL).

In this problem, our aim is to design SSDs that allow developers to customize SSD hardware according to the application needs.

## Task Description

SSD customers typically evaluate SSD performance using key metrics including I/O throughput, average latency and tail latency. In this section, you should optimize the given SSD configuration by tuning only the layout related parameters ("Overprovisioning_Ratio", "Flash_Channel_Count", "Chip_No_Per_Channel", "Die_No_Per_Chip", "Plane_No_Per_Die",
 "Block_No_Per_Plane", "Page_No_Per_Block"). You should identify a set of these parameter that satisfy the capacity constraint (The total usable capacity, not considering the over provisioning, should be around 2TB, specifically, 1.7TB - 2.1TB) and reach the performance requirements. If the requirement cannot be reached, please answer "impossible" instead of the final parameter value. Please always provide your reasoning.

### Formal Problem Definition

Given a parameter set $S$ and a workload set $W$, tune the parameters ("Overprovisioning_Ratio", "Flash_Channel_Count", "Chip_No_Per_Channel", "Die_No_Per_Chip", "Plane_No_Per_Die",
 "Block_No_Per_Plane", "Page_No_Per_Block") $s \in S$ that affects the I/O throughput, average latency or both of them for each workload $w \in W$. Specifically, address the following question:

If we want to get 20\% performance improvement on I/O throughput or on average latency comparing to the baseline configuration (see next section), while also satisfy the capacity constraint (The total capacity, not considering the over provisioning, should be around 2TB, specifically, 1.7TB - 2.1TB) how should we tune these parameters? If this is impossible, please answer "impossible" instead of providing the number and explain why. Note that the correlation between performance and parameter values are usurally not linear.

### Configuration Set

Please provide answer for each parameter listed in the table below. The third column of this table listed the baseline configuration (Samsung 983 DCT 1.92TB SSD). We provide typical values for each parameter, the tuned parameter should follow the general trend in the listed parameters (e.g., number of channels should be descrete numbers). 

For convenience of reasoning, we provide all the parameters for the baseline. Please only tune the speciftied parameters ("Overprovisioning_Ratio", "Flash_Channel_Count", "Chip_No_Per_Channel", "Die_No_Per_Chip", "Plane_No_Per_Die",
 "Block_No_Per_Plane", "Page_No_Per_Block") and the tuning range is specified in the listed parameters.
