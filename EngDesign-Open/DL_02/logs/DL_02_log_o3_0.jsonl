{'completion_tokens': 7552, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='We need to produce, for every target workload class, a configuration that (1) keeps the raw capacity – i.e. before the over-provisioning reserve is removed – inside 1.7 TB-2.1 TB, and (2) can realistically give ≈20 % better effective performance than the baseline either by higher parallelism (more channels / dies) or by markedly larger over-provisioning, which is known to cut write-amplification and therefore average / tail latency.\n\nCapacity calculation reminder (baseline):\n 8 channels × 4 chips × 8 dies × 2 planes × 1 364 blocks × 768 pages × 4 KiB ≈ 2 047 GiB ≈ 2 TB.\n\n• Raising the over-provisioning ratio alone improves latency (less GC pressure) but does not change the ‘raw’ capacity, so the geometry may stay unchanged for mainly-latency-bound workloads.\n• For throughput-bound workloads we raise the number of channels and keep the overall page-count roughly constant by cutting back dies-per-chip and/or blocks-per-plane.  Two practical geometries that satisfy the capacity window are:\n  – G1: 12 ch × 4 chip × 6 die × 2 pl × 1 024 blk × 768 pg  ⇒ 0.844 × baseline capacity ≈ 1.728 TB (inside window).  Parallel resources: 12 × 4 × 6 × 2 = 576 (≈13 % more than 512 baseline).\n  – G2: 10 ch × 4 chip × 6 die × 2 pl × 1 364 blk × 768 pg  ⇒ 0.937 × baseline ≈ 1.918 TB.  Parallel resources: 480 (very close to baseline but with 25 % more channels, therefore higher host-visible BW).\n\nMapping these to workload needs:\n• Big-Data Analytics & Advertisement – heavy sequential/throughput: choose G1.\n• Maps & Database – mixed read/write, need a bit more BW but still decent latency: choose G2 with moderate extra over-provisioning.\n• Cloud-Storage, Key-Value Store, WebSearch – very latency-sensitive; keep baseline geometry but push over-provisioning to 0.3-0.5 so that GC pressure and write-amp drop ≥20 %, yielding >20 % latency improvement while capacity stays the same.\n\nAll resulting raw capacities are in the 1.7-2.1 TB band; only the reserved (over-provisioned) space changes.
