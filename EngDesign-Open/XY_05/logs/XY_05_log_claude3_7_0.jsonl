For arithmetic/logic instructions (ADD, AND, NOT, SWAP):\n   - They need to load a result into a register (ld_reg=1)\n   - They update condition codes (ld_cc=1)\n   - They use the ALU and need to gate its result to the bus (gateALU=1)\n   - They don't access memory (mem_en=0, mem_we=0)\n   - They don't load the instruction register or PC during execution (ld_ir=0, ld_pc=0)\n\n2. For memory access instructions:\n   - LDR needs to read from memory (mem_en=1, mem_we=0) and load a register (ld_reg=1)\n   - LDR gates MDR to the bus (gateMDR=1) and updates condition codes (ld_cc=1)\n   - STR writes to memory (mem_en=1, mem_we=1) but doesn't load registers or update condition codes\n\n3. For control flow instructions:\n   - BR and JMP update the PC (ld_pc=1) and use the ALU for address calculation (gateALU=1)\n   - JSR saves return address to R7 (ld_reg=1) and then updates PC (ld_pc=1)\n   - None of these access memory or update condition codes during execution\n\nFor state transitions, I'm following the state machine structure provided:\n- Single-cycle instructions (ADD, AND, NOT, JMP, SWAP) move directly from their execution state to s_18 (fetch)\n- Multi-cycle instructions have sequences (LDR, STR, JSR)\n- BR has conditional paths depending on whether the branch is taken or not\n\nThe state transitions follow the specified CPU states, ensuring all execution paths eventually return to the fetch cycle (s_18).
