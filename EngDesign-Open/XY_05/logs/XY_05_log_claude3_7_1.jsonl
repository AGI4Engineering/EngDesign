For each instruction, I determined the appropriate control signal settings during execution:\n\n1. For arithmetic/logic instructions (ADD, AND, NOT), I set ld_reg=1 and ld_cc=1 to store results and update condition codes, with gateALU=1 to drive the bus.\n\n2. For branch instructions (BR), I determined that we need ld_pc=1 when taken, but no other register updates.\n\n3. For jump instructions (JMP), we only need ld_pc=1 to update the program counter.\n\n4. For JSR, I ensured it saves the return address to R7 (ld_reg=1) before jumping (ld_pc=1).\n\n5. For memory instructions (LDR, STR), I set appropriate memory signals (mem_en=1 with mem_we=0 for read, mem_we=1 for write) and ensured data paths were correct (gateMDR=1 for LDR).\n\nFor the state transitions, I mapped each instruction to its correct states:\n- Simple instructions (ADD, AND, NOT, JMP) transition directly from their execution state to s_18 (fetch).\n- BR conditionally goes to s_22 if taken, then to s_18, or directly to s_18 if not taken.\n- JSR passes through s_21 (linkage) before s_4 (execution) and back to s_18.\n- LDR follows a sequence through address calculation (s_6), memory access (s_25_1,2,3), and data ready (s_27) states.\n- STR goes through address calculation (s_7), preparation (s_23), and memory write (s_16_1,2,3) states.\n\nFor the custom SWAP instruction, I treated it similarly to ADD but noted that it affects two registers.\n\nI made sure to follow all critical design constraints, ensuring that hardware safety is maintained (no multiple components driving the bus), control accuracy is preserved (PC updates only during branch/jump), and all paths properly return to the fetch cycle."), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'ports_assignment': '59/60', 'state_transitions': '17/25', 'formatting': '9/15'}, 'score': 86}
