During execution, the ALU computes the sum, gates it to the bus, loads the result into the destination register, and updates condition codes to reflect the result (negative, zero, or positive). After execution, the CPU returns to the fetch cycle.', 'AND': 'The AND instruction performs bitwise logical AND between source registers or a register and immediate value. The ALU computes the result, gates it to the bus, loads it into the destination register, and updates condition codes based on the result. This operation is crucial for bit manipulation tasks and can be used to mask specific bits in a value.', 'NOT': "The NOT instruction computes the bitwise complement (one's complement) of the source register. The ALU performs the inversion of all bits, gates the result to the bus, loads it into the destination register, and updates condition codes. This instruction is fundamental for logical operations and can be combined with AND to create NAND operations.", 'LDR': 'The LDR instruction loads data from memory into a register. It first calculates the effective address by adding a base register value and an offset. Then it initiates a memory read sequence through states s_25_1, s_25_2, and s_25_3, waits for the data to become available in MDR, gates this data to the bus, loads it into the destination register, and updates condition codes based on the loaded value.', 'STR': "The STR instruction stores a register's contents into memory. It calculates the effective address by adding a base register value and an offset. Then it prepares for memory write in state s_23 by loading the source register value into MDR, and performs the memory write sequence through states s_16_1, s_16_2, and s_16_3. This instruction does not update any registers or condition codes.", 'BR': 'The BR instruction performs conditional branching based on condition codes. If the branch condition is met (matching the status of N, Z, or P bits), the CPU enters the branch taken state (s_22), calculates the branch target address by adding the PC and the sign-extended offset, and updates the PC. If the condition is not met, it simply returns to the fetch cycle without changing the PC.', 'JMP': 'The JMP instruction performs an unconditional jump to an address stored in a base register. During execution, the base register value is gated through the ALU to the bus and loaded into the PC. This instruction is used for implementing function returns (when the base register is R7) and for computed jumps to dynamic addresses.', 'JSR': 'The JSR instruction jumps to a subroutine after saving the return address. First, it saves the current PC value (the return address) to register R7 in state s_4. Then, in state s_21, it calculates the subroutine address and loads it into the PC. This instruction handles call linkage for subroutines, allowing proper returns using the JMP instruction with R7.', 'SWAP': "The SWAP instruction exchanges the contents of two registers. It reads values from both source registers, temporarily stores them, and writes them back to the opposite registers. This custom instruction simplifies register content exchange which would otherwise require three operations (using a temporary register). Being a data movement operation, it doesn't update condition codes."}, state_transitions={'ADD': {'current': 's_1', 'next': 's_18'}, 'AND': {'current': 's_5', 'next': 's_18'}, 'NOT': {'current': 's_9', 'next': 's_18'}, 'BR': {'current': 's_0', 'next_taken': 's_22', 'next_not_taken': 's_18', 'sequence_taken': 's_22,s_18'}, 'JMP': {'current': 's_12', 'next': 's_18'}, 'JSR': {'current': 's_4', 'next': 's_21', 'sequence': 's_4,s_21,s_18'}, 'LDR': {'current': 's_6', 'next': 's_25_1', 'sequence': 's_6,s_25_1,s_25_2,s_25_3,s_27,s_18'}, 'STR': {'current': 's_7', 'next': 's_23', 'sequence': 's_7,s_23,s_16_1,s_16_2,s_16_3,s_18'}, 'SWAP': {'current': 's_30', 'next': 's_18'}}), reasoning='I analyzed each SLC-3 CPU instruction to determine the proper control signals and state transitions. For basic operations like ADD, AND, and NOT, the execution is straightforward: the ALU performs the operation, results are gated to the bus, and loaded into a destination register while updating condition codes. Memory operations (LDR, STR) require multi-cycle sequences to calculate addresses and perform memory access. Branch instructions (BR) have conditional paths depending on whether the branch is taken. Jump operations (JMP, JSR) update the PC with a new target address, with JSR additionally saving the return address in R7. For the custom SWAP instruction, I designed signals that enable register exchange without memory operations. All execution paths correctly return to the fetch state (s_18) to ensure proper CPU cycling, and I carefully avoided setting multiple bus-driving signals simultaneously to prevent hardware conflicts.'), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'ports_assignment': '58/60', 'state_transitions': '20/25', 'formatting': '9/15'}, 'score': 87}
