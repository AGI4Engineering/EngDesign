# SLC-3 CPU Advanced Design Evaluation Rubric

## Control Signal Assignment (54 points)
- Each instruction's control signals are worth up to 6 points
- Points are awarded based on correctness of each signal:
  - Full credit (1 point) for signals that exactly match the reference solution
  - Partial credit (0.75 points) for acceptable alternative values
  - Minimal credit (0.5 points) for "don't care" (X) values that should be explicit
  - No credit for completely incorrect signal values

### Critical Signal Requirements:
- LDR must update condition codes (ld_cc=1)
- JSR must save return address (ld_reg=1)
- No bus conflicts allowed (only one of gateALU or gateMDR can be 1)
- Memory write requires memory enable (if mem_we=1, then mem_en must be 1)

## Technical Explanations (22 points)
- Each instruction's explanation is evaluated on:
  - Basic completeness (1 point)
  - Technical precision and terminology (1 point)
  - Functional accuracy (0.5 points)
  - Explanation of inactive signals (0.5 points)

### Explanation Requirements:
- Must reference specific hardware components (ALU, PC, registers, etc.)
- Must explain datapath traversal (how data flows)
- Must justify both active AND inactive signals
- Must describe condition code handling

## State Transition Mapping (15 points)
- Each instruction's state transition is evaluated on:
  - Correct current state identification (1 point)
  - Correct next state identification (1 point) 
  - Complete sequence for multi-cycle instructions (1 point)

### State Transition Requirements:
- Single-cycle instructions: Current state and next state
- Multi-cycle instructions: Complete state sequence
- BR instruction: Both taken and not-taken paths
- Correctly identify the fetch cycle return state (s_18)

## Format and Completeness (9 points)
- Complete coverage of all instructions (3 points)
- Complete coverage of all control signals (3 points)
- Complete explanations for all instructions (3 points)

## Critical Error Penalties (-20 points)
Any of the following will result in significant point deduction:
- Bus contention (multiple components driving bus)
- Invalid memory operations
- Other hardware safety violations

## Passing Requirements
- Minimum total score: 85/100 points
- No critical errors
- Demonstrated understanding of both control signals and state machine

This rubric evaluates comprehensive understanding of CPU design principles, including control signal assignments, state machine implementation, and hardware safety considerations.
