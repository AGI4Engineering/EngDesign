{'completion_tokens': 381, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='To implement a parameterized Gray-to-binary converter in SystemVerilog, we need to follow the given specification closely. The module should be parameterized by WIDTH, which defaults to 8, allowing the module to handle Gray code inputs of varying bit widths. The conversion from Gray code to binary is a combinational process, meaning it does not involve any clock or reset signals.\n\nThe conversion logic is straightforward:\n1. The most significant bit (MSB) of the binary output is the same as the MSB of the Gray code input.\n2. For each subsequent bit, the binary output bit is the XOR of the next higher binary output bit and the corresponding Gray code input bit.\n\nThis can be efficiently implemented using a generate-for loop, which iterates over the bit positions from WIDTH-2 down to 0, applying the XOR operation as specified.\n\nThe resulting SystemVerilog code will be clean, well-commented, and synthesizable, ensuring it meets the requirements for zero-latency combinational logic.', code='module gray_to_binary_converter #(\n    parameter WIDTH = 8\n) (\n    input  logic [WIDTH-1:0] gray,  // N-bit Gray code input\n    output logic [WIDTH-1:0] bin    // N-bit binary index output\n);\n\n    // Assign the most significant bit directly\n    assign bin[WIDTH-1] = gray[WIDTH-1];\n\n    // Generate loop for the rest of the bits\n    genvar i;\n    generate\n        for (i = WIDTH-2; i >= 0; i = i - 1) begin : gray_to_bin\n            assign bin[i] = bin[i+1] ^ gray[i];\n        end\n    endgenerate\n\nendmodule'), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'compile_error': 'tb.sv:12: error: Unknown module type: model\n2 error(s) during elaboration.\n*** These modules were missing:\n        model referenced 1 times.\n***'}, 'score': 0}
