This is a combinational logic module that takes a Gray code input and produces a binary output.\n2. The module needs to be parameterized with WIDTH (default 8 bits).\n3. The conversion algorithm is defined as:\n   - The MSB of binary equals the MSB of Gray code\n   - For all other bits, bin[i] = bin[i+1] ^ gray[i]\n\nThe conversion works by XORing each Gray code bit with the previously calculated binary bit, starting from the MSB.\n\nThere are two main approaches:\n1. Use a generate-for loop to create the XOR cascade.\n2. Use a bitwise reduction operation.\n\nI'll implement the generate-for loop approach as it's more explicit and readable. The implementation will be purely combinational with no clock or reset, as specified.\n\nI notice that the requested module name should be 'fifo2' based on the task description, so I'll use that name for the module.", code='module fifo2 #(\n    parameter WIDTH = 8\n) (\n    input  logic [WIDTH-1:0] gray,  // Gray code input\n    output logic [WIDTH-1:0] bin    // Binary output\n);\n\n    // Gray to binary conversion\n    // MSB of binary equals MSB of Gray code\n    assign bin[WIDTH-1] = gray[WIDTH-1];\n    \n    // For all other bits, bin[i] = bin[i+1] ^ gray[i]\n    genvar i;\n    generate\n        for (i = WIDTH-2; i >= 0; i--) begin : gray_to_bin_conversion\n            assign bin[i] = bin[i+1] ^ gray[i];\n        end\n    endgenerate\n\nendmodule'), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'compile_error': 'tb.sv:12: error: Unknown module type: model\n2 error(s) during elaboration.\n*** These modules were missing:\n        model referenced 1 times.\n***'}, 'score': 0}
