{'completion_tokens': 2526, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='The task is to design a synthesizable SystemVerilog module `model` for a target sequence detector. The module needs to be parameterized by `TARGET_WIDTH`, and have specified input/output ports.\n\n1.  **Module Definition and Ports**:\n    The module `model` is defined with a parameter `TARGET_WIDTH` (defaulting to 5). The ports are:\n    -   `clk` (input logic): Clock signal.\n    -   `resetn` (input logic): Synchronous, active-low reset signal.\n    -   `init` (input logic `[TARGET_WIDTH-1:0]`): The target sequence to be detected. It\'s loaded on reset.\n    -   `din` (input logic): Serial input bit.\n    -   `seen` (output logic): Pulses high for one cycle when the target sequence is detected.\n\n2.  **Internal Registers**:\n    Two main internal registers are needed:\n    -   `target_reg`: A `TARGET_WIDTH`-bit register to store the `init` value. This register is loaded when `resetn` is low and holds its value otherwise.\n    -   `shift_reg`: A `TARGET_WIDTH`-bit shift register to store the most recent `TARGET_WIDTH` bits from `din`.\n\n3.  **Behavioral Implementation**:\n\n    a.  **Target Loading** (`target_reg`):\n        -   An `always_ff @(posedge clk)` block is used for `target_reg`.\n        -   On synchronous reset (`if (!resetn)`), `target_reg` is loaded with `init`.\n        -   Otherwise (`resetn` is high), `target_reg` retains its previous value. This is implicitly handled by not assigning to it in an `else` branch for the `resetn` condition.\n\n    b.  **Shift Register** (`shift_reg`):\n        -   An `always_ff @(posedge clk)` block is used for `shift_reg`.\n        -   On synchronous reset (`if (!resetn)`), `shift_reg` is cleared to all zeros (`{TARGET_WIDTH{1\'b0}}`).\n        -   Otherwise (`resetn` is high), `shift_reg` shifts in the new `din` bit. The chosen convention is `shift_reg <= {shift_reg[TARGET_WIDTH-2:0], din};`. This means `din` becomes the new LSB (`shift_reg[0]`), and previous bits shift towards the MSB. `shift_reg[TARGET_WIDTH-1]` is the oldest bit.\n\n    c.  **Detection and `seen` Output Logic**:\n        -   The core detection logic is a comparison: `shift_reg == target_reg`.\n        -   The `seen` output must be asserted for one cycle upon a match and adhere to "fully synchronous logic". This is best achieved by making `seen` a registered output.\n        -   An `always_ff @(posedge clk)` block is used for `seen`.\n        -   On synchronous reset (`if (!resetn)`), `seen` is set to `1\'b0`.\n        -   Otherwise (`resetn` is high), `seen` is assigned the result of `(shift_reg == target_reg)`. This means `seen` will be updated at the same clock edge that `shift_reg` is updated. If a match occurs due to the new state of `shift_reg`, `seen` becomes high in that clock cycle and remains high until the next clock edge.\n\n    d.  **Padding Note**: The specification mentions "Treat shorter init values as zero-padded on the high side". Since the `init` port is already defined as `logic [TARGET_WIDTH-1:0]`, it implies that the user of this module is responsible for performing any necessary padding *before* providing the value to the `init` port. The module itself will take the `TARGET_WIDTH`-bit `init` value as is.\n\n4.  **Compliance with Implementation Notes**:\n\n    a.  **Fully Synchronous Logic**: All registers (`target_reg`, `shift_reg`) and the output `seen` are updated on the positive edge of `clk`. Resets are synchronous, meaning `resetn` is sampled at the clock edge.\n\n    b.  **Comparator (Generate/Loop)**: The specification mentions using a `generate` or `loop` for the comparator if desired. However, for a simple equality comparison `(shift_reg == target_reg)`, SystemVerilog\'s `==` operator is concise, readable, and synthesizes efficiently to the appropriate logic (typically a tree of XNOR gates followed by an AND reduction). An explicit `generate` block would add verbosity without significant benefit for this common operation. Therefore, the direct `==` is used.\n\n    c.  **`seen` Pulse and Overlapping Matches**: The registered `seen` output ensures it changes synchronously with the clock. If a match condition `(shift_reg == target_reg)` is true after a clock edge, `seen` will be `1` for that entire clock cycle. If the match condition remains true for `N` consecutive cycles (which can happen with overlapping patterns like detecting `111` in `011110`), `seen` will remain high for `N` cycles. This behavior is consistent with allowing overlapping matches.\n\n5.  **Edge Case Consideration (`TARGET_WIDTH = 1`)**:\n    If `TARGET_WIDTH = 1`, the shift register update `shift_reg <= {shift_reg[TARGET_WIDTH-2:0], din};` becomes `shift_reg <= {shift_reg[-1:0], din};`. The slice `shift_reg[-1:0]` is a null slice in SystemVerilog. Concatenation with a null slice `{null_slice, din}` effectively results in `{din}`. Since `din` is a single bit, `shift_reg <= din;` is the correct behavior for `TARGET_WIDTH = 1`. The logic holds.\n\n6.  **Code Style and Comments**:\n    The SystemVerilog code is written with comments explaining the module\'s purpose, parameters, ports, and the functionality of internal logic blocks, aiming for clarity and maintainability, suitable for synthesis.', code="// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 \n// (Replace with your chosen license or remove if not applicable)\n//\n// Description:\n// This module implements a target sequence detector.
