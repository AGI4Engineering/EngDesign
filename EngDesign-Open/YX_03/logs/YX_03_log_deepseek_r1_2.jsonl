For Task 1, the radar range equation yielded an SNR of 18.33 dB. Subsequent tasks applied Albersheim's approximation, Swerling models, integration and loss formulas. For example, Task 5's integration gain (8.20 dB) reduced the required SNR, while Task 6's fluctuation loss (6.40 dB) increased it. Effective detectability (Task 14) summed gains and losses, resulting in 24.12 dB.
