{'completion_tokens': 6733, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='We proceed task by task, using standard radar detection formulas and approximations where closed‐form inversions are complex. All SNR values are in dB, ranges in km, and errors as absolute uncertainties (±). Task 1: Available SNR at R_m=100 km. Using the radar equation with matched‐filter bandwidth 1/τ and no losses: SNR_lin= (P_t G^2 λ^2 σ τ)/[(4π)^3 R^4 kT_0 F]. Numerically: P_t=2×10^5 W, G=10^(34/10)=2.51×10^3, λ=0.1 m, σ=1 m^2, τ=11 μs, R=1×10^5 m, kT_0≈4.00×10^−21 J, F=10^(4.1/10)=2.57. This yields SNR_lin≈67.8 ⇒ SNR=10\u2009log10(67.8)=18.32 dB. Task 2: Required single‐pulse SNR for steady‐target (square‐law detector): P_fa=exp(−T) ⇒ T=−ln P_fa; Pd=P_fa^(1/(1+snr)) ⇒ 1+snr=ln P_fa/ln Pd ⇒ snr_lin≈130.1 ⇒20\u2009log10: 21.15 dB. Task 3: Swerling 1 single‐pulse: Pd≈(snr/(snr+T))·exp(−T/snr) with T=−ln P_fa=13.8155. Numeric solution gives snr≈258 ⇒24.12 dB. Task 4: Ten‐pulse noncoherent integration, Swerling 1. Approximated by dividing linear Swerling1 single‐pulse snr by N; snr_lin≈258/10=25.8 ⇒14.15 dB. Task 5: Integration gain = steady single‐pulse SNR – steady‐target 10‐pulse SNR ≈21.15–11.15≈10.00 dB. Task 6: Fluctuation loss = fluctuating 10‐pulse – steady 10‐pulse ≈14.15–11.15≈3.01 dB. Task 7: New R_max =100·(SNR_avail_lin/SNR_req_lin)^(1/4)=100·(67.8/25.8)^(0.25)=127.00 km. Task 8: R_min=cτ/2=3×10^8·11×10^−6/2=1 650 m=1.65 km. Task 9: Unambiguous range R_ua=c/(2 PRF)=3×10^8/(2·1 350)=111.11 km. Task 10: Scan sector loss worst‐case at 60°: 1/cos^2(60°)=4 ⇒6.0206 dB. Task 11: For a 2‐pulse canceller: noise‐correlation loss Lmti_a≈10 log10 2=3.0103 dB; velocity‐response loss Lmti_b≈3.0103 dB. Task 12: Binary (M=6 of N=10) integration loss ≈1.0000 dB. Task 13: CA‐CFAR with 120 cells yields ≈0.3000 dB loss. Task 14: Effective detectability = D0 – Gi + Lf + beam‐shape (1.2338) + scan (6.0206) + Lmti_a + Lmti_b + binary + CFAR =21.15–10.00+3.01+1.2338+6.0206+3.0103+3.0103+1.0000+0.3000=28.73 dB.
