The required SNRs for steady and fluctuating targets (Tasks 2-4) were derived using detection theory and integration effects. Integration gain (Task 5) and fluctuation loss (Task 6) were computed by comparing steady and fluctuating target SNRs. Maximum range (Task 7) was adjusted based on required SNR. Eclipsing ranges (Tasks 8-9) used pulse timing and PRF. Scan sector loss (Task 10) accounted for phased array beam broadening. MTI losses (Task 11) included noise correlation and velocity suppression. Binary integration and CFAR losses (Tasks 12-13) were approximated from literature.
