Each task's output is calculated based on standard radar equations, approximations, or typical values derived from radar engineering literature and charts. Errors are estimated based on the method of calculation (direct formula vs. chart/table lookup) and rounding.\n\nTask 1: Calculate available SNR (SNRatRm).\nUsing the radar range equation for energy: SNR = (P_t * tau * G^2 * lambda^2 * sigma) / ((4*pi)^3 * R^4 * k * T_0 * F * L).\nPt = 0.2 MW = 2e5 W, tau = 11e-6 s, G = 34 dB = 2511.886, lambda = c/f = 3e8 / 3e9 = 0.1 m, sigma = 1 m^2, R = 100 km = 1e5 m, k = 1.380649e-23 J/K, T0 = 290 K, F = 4.1 dB = 2.570396, L = 0 dB = 1.\nE_pulse = Pt * tau = 2.2 J.\nNumerator = 2.2 * (2511.886)^2 * (0.1)^2 * 1 = 138810.6157.\nDenominator_N0_part = k * T0 * F = 1.380649e-23 * 290 * 2.570396 = 1.03015e-20 W/Hz (or J).\nDenominator = (4*pi)^3 * R^4 * Denominator_N0_part * L = 1984.4368 * (1e5)^4 * 1.03015e-20 * 1 = 2044.27.\nSNR_lin = 138810.6157 / 2044.27 = 67.900.\nSNRatRm_dB = 10*log10(67.900) = 18.3185 dB. Rounded to 18.32 dB.\n\nTask 2: Required SNR for steady target (D0).\nFor Pd = 0.9, Pfa = 1e-6, N=1 pulse, steady target. From standard radar charts (e.g., Blake's), D0 is approximately 13.1 dB. Rounded to 13.10 dB.\n\nTask 3: Required SNR for Swerling 1 target (D1).\nFor Pd = 0.9, Pfa = 1e-6, N=1 pulse, Swerling 1 target.\nFormula: Pd = Pfa^(1 / (1 + SNR_lin)).\nln(Pd) = (1 / (1 + SNR_lin)) * ln(Pfa).\n1 + SNR_lin = ln(Pfa) / ln(Pd) = -ln(1e-6) / -ln(0.9) = 13.81551056 / 0.105360516 = 131.1266.\nSNR_lin = 130.1266.\nD1_dB = 10*log10(130.1266) = 21.1436 dB. Rounded to 21.14 dB.\n\nTask 4: Required SNR for N=10, Swerling 1 (DN).\nFor Pd = 0.9, Pfa = 1e-6, N=10 pulses, Swerling 1 target. From standard radar charts (e.g., Blake's), DN is approximately 8.6 dB. Rounded to 8.60 dB.\n\nTask 5: Integration gain (Gi).\nGi = D0 - SNR_req(steady, N=10).\nSNR_req(steady, N=10) for Pd=0.9, Pfa=1e-6 from charts is approx. 6.0 dB.\nGi = 13.10 dB - 6.00 dB = 7.10 dB.\n\nTask 6: Fluctuation loss (Lf).\nLf = DN - SNR_req(steady, N=10) = 8.60 dB - 6.00 dB = 2.60 dB.\n\nTask 7: Actual maximum range (actual_Rm).\nSNR_req = DN = 8.60 dB = 10^(8.60/10) = 7.24436.\nFrom Task 1, SNR_lin = C / R^4, so C = SNR_lin_at_100km * (100km)^4 = 67.900 * (1e5 m)^4.\nR_actual^4 = C / SNR_req = (67.900 * 1e20 m^4) / 7.24436 = 9.37279e20 m^4.\nR_actual = (9.37279e20)^(1/4) m = 1.749709 * 1e5 m = 174.9709 km. Rounded to 174.97 km.\n\nTask 8: Minimum range (Rmin).\nRmin = c * tau / 2 = (3e8 m/s * 11e-6 s) / 2 = 1650 m = 1.65 km.\n\nTask 9: Unambiguous range (Rua).\nRua = c / (2 * PRF) = (3e8 m/s) / (2 * 1350 Hz) = 111111.11 m = 111.11 km.\n\nTask 10: Scan sector loss.\nLoss due to scanning to theta_max = 60 degrees. Assuming G(theta) ~ cos(theta) for both effects combined for one-way, so G_eff_2way(theta) ~ cos^2(theta). Loss = 1/cos^2(60 deg) = 1/(0.5)^2 = 4.\nLoss_dB = 10*log10(4) = 6.0206 dB.\n\nTask 11: MTI losses.\nLmti_a (noise correlation loss for 2-pulse canceller, N=10): Loss = 10*log10(N/(N-1)) = 10*log10(10/9) = 0.45757 dB. Rounded to 0.4576 dB.\nLmti_b (velocity response loss): For 2-pulse canceller, Swerling 1, Pd=0.9, Pfa=1e-6, N=10. Using Barton's tables, this is 2.6 dB. Rounded to 2.6000 dB.\n\nTask 12: Binary integration loss.\nFor N=10, M=6, Pd=0.9, Pfa=1e-6. Typical loss value from radar literature/tables is around 1.7 dB. Rounded to 1.7000 dB.\n\nTask 13: CFAR loss.\nFor CA-CFAR, Pfa=1e-6, N_ref_cells = 120. From charts/tables (e.g., Blake or Rohling), loss is approx. 0.4 dB. Rounded to 0.4000 dB.\n\nTask 14: Effective detectability factor (effective_df).\nEffective_df = D0 - Gi + Lf + L_beamshape + L_scan_sector + Lmti_a + Lmti_b + L_binary_integration + L_cfar.\nNote that D0 - Gi + Lf = SNR(N=1,steady) - (SNR(N=1,steady)-SNR(N=10,steady)) + (SNR(N=10,SW1)-SNR(N=10,steady)) = SNR(N=10,SW1) = DN.\nSo, Effective_df = DN + L_beamshape + L_scan_sector + Lmti_a + Lmti_b + L_binary_integration + L_cfar.\nDN = 8.60 dB.\nL_beamshape = 1.2338 dB (given).\nL_scan_sector = 6.0206 dB (Task 10).\nLmti_a = 0.4576 dB (Task 11a).\nLmti_b = 2.6000 dB (Task 11b).\nL_binary_integration = 1.7000 dB (Task 12).\nL_cfar = 0.4000 dB (Task 13).\nEffective_df = 8.60 + 1.2338 + 6.0206 + 0.4576 + 2.6000 + 1.7000 + 0.4000 = 21.0120 dB. Rounded to 21.01 dB.\n\nTask 15: Evaluate system feasibility.\nCompare SNRatRm (Task 1) with effective_df (Task 14).\nSNRatRm = 18.32 dB.\neffective_df = 21.01 dB.\nSince 18.32 dB < 21.01 dB, the system does not meet the requirement.
