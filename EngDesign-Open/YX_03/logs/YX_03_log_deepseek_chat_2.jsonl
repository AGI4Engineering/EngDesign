Each task builds upon the previous one, starting with the calculation of available SNR at a given range, then determining required SNRs for different target and detection conditions, followed by calculating various losses and gains, and finally evaluating the system's feasibility based on the effective detectability factor. The calculations involve radar equations, probability of detection and false alarm considerations, integration techniques, and various system losses.
