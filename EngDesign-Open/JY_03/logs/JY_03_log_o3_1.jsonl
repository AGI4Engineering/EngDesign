Problem analysis\nThe raw 100×100 polarization frame follows the standard micro-polarizer (2×2) pattern, so every second pixel along each row/column belongs to another polarization angle.  After demosaicking we already have the four sub-frames Degree0, 45, 90 and 135, but Degree0 is corrupted: all valid samples sit on one colour-checkerboard whereas the complementary sites are filled with the value 0.\n\n2. Interpolation strategy\nThe task is identical to filling a Bayer-like half-resolution grid: we want to keep the original non-zero samples unchanged and linearly interpolate the missing ones from their direct neighbours (horizontal / vertical).  A classical bilinear stencil for a missing pixel p̂ centred in a 3×3 window is\n\np̂ = ¼·(pN + pS + pE + pW)            (N,E,S,W are the four direct neighbours)\n\nWhen we implement this by a single convolution kernel we have to set the central coefficient to 1 so that, after the convolution, the valid pixels remain unchanged (because 1·p + 0·… = p). The four direct neighbours receive the weight 0.25 each; the diagonals are set to 0 because they are not used in pure linear (bilinear) interpolation.\n\nThe 3×3 kernel therefore is\n\n    0      0.25     0\n    0.25   1.00     0.25\n    0      0.25     0\n\n3. Usage\n• Apply a 2-D convolution to the whole Degree0 image with the above kernel.\n• For every pixel position (i,j):\n    – if the original Degree0(i,j) is non-zero, keep it (overwrite the convolution result with the original value).\n    – otherwise take the convolved value (already a weighted average of the four neighbours).\n\nThis single pass recovers the missing values while leaving the existing data untouched, and the reconstructed frame can now be passed to the AoLP/DoLP computation.\n\n4. AoLP / DoLP implications\nBecause the interpolation is strictly linear and only mixes information inside the same polarization sub-image, it does not introduce directional bias; therefore the resulting AoLP/DoLP error will be minimal and well within the acceptance threshold usually used when benchmarking demosaicking kernels for polarimetric cameras.', config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.0, 0.25, 0.0], [0.25, 1.0, 0.25], [0.0, 0.25, 0.0]])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'degree_0': {'PSNR': np.float64(28.482966870725463), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.7997634244963788), 'Score': [np.float64(75.59187981322577), np.float64(145.53161029737694), np.float64(151.17270010421575)]}, 'DoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(76.42642463001022), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999715901972833), 'Score': [np.float64(75.59187981322577), np.float64(145.53161029737694), np.float64(151.17270010421575)]}, 'AoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(80.93853635123924), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999905933033336), 'Score': [np.float64(75.59187981322577), np.float64(145.53161029737694), np.float64(151.17270010421575)]}}, 'score': np.float64(91.86395993774192)}
