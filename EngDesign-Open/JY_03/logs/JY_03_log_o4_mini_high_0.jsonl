{'completion_tokens': 1613, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. We start by inspecting the provided Degree0 array and observe that every other pixel is zero, forming a checkerboard of missing measurements.\n2. To recover these missing values, we choose to perform linear interpolation by convolving the image with a small kernel: each missing pixel will be estimated as a weighted average of its nearest neighbors.\n3. A 3×3 kernel is sufficient: it includes the center pixel (which for known entries remains unchanged), its four direct neighbors (horizontal and vertical), and its four diagonal neighbors. We assign weights proportional to their distance—diagonals get 0.25, direct neighbors get 0.5, and the center gets 1.0—to mimic bilinear interpolation.\n4. This kernel has its central element equal to 1.0 as required and yields a smooth, linear interpolation for the missing checkerboard values. It can also be applied to the AoLP and DoLP images to assess and optimize interpolation quality with respect to polarization-derived metrics.', config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.25, 0.5, 0.25], [0.5, 1.0, 0.5], [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'degree_0': {'PSNR': np.float64(23.69400650701499), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.714446096593812), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}, 'DoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(74.13881600756719), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999104436825622), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}, 'AoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(76.86743477949068), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999381998661628), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}}, 'score': np.float64(88.44660432115312)}
