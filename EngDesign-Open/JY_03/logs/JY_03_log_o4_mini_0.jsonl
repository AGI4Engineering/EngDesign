{'completion_tokens': 1000, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='Step 1: Observe that the Degree0 image is corrupted in a perfect checkerboard pattern: every other pixel is zero, alternating both along rows and columns. This suggests that missing values can be recovered by interpolating from their four direct neighbors and, more accurately, including the diagonal neighbors to approximate a bilinear interpolation.\n\nStep 2: In a bilinear interpolation scheme over a regular grid, an interior missing point can be estimated by a weighted sum of its eight neighbors plus itself. The weights are proportional to the inverse of the Manhattan distance. Specifically:\n- The center pixel (where the data is missing) should be replaced by 1 times its own (zero) value when convolving, but combined with neighbor contributions this preserves consistency.\n- The four direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) each get half the weight of the center: 0.5.\n- The four diagonal neighbors each get a quarter of the center weight: 0.25.\n\nStep 3: Arrange these coefficients into a 3Ã—3 convolution kernel whose center is 1, direct neighbors 0.5, and diagonals 0.25:\n\n      [0.25, 0.50, 0.25]\n      [0.50, 1.00, 0.50]\n      [0.25, 0.50, 0.25]\n\nConvolving the corrupted checkerboard image with this kernel will replace zeros by the weighted average of their neighbors (effectively a bilinear interpolation), while preserving the original nonzero pixels suitably scaled. This kernel thus fills the missing pixels in a principled way, and will improve the computed AoLP and DoLP metrics by restoring spatial consistency.', config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.25, 0.5, 0.25], [0.5, 1.0, 0.5], [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'degree_0': {'PSNR': np.float64(23.69400650701499), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.714446096593812), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}, 'DoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(74.13881600756719), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999104436825622), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}, 'AoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(76.86743477949068), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999381998661628), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}}, 'score': np.float64(88.44660432115312)}
