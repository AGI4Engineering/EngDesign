This lets each zero pixel be replaced by a portion of its neighbors while preserving the original pixel if it is non-zero, thus \"mimicking\" interpolation. 4) The chosen kernel has center weight = 1 and distributes 0.25 across the top/bottom/left/right neighbors, resulting in the matrix shown below. 5) This kernel can serve as a basis for iterative filling or used conditionally on zero-valued pixels to produce a smoothed interpolation for the corrupted Degree0 data.' config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.0, 0.25, 0.0], [0.25, 1.0, 0.25], [0.0, 0.25, 0.0]])", "passed": true, "evaluation_result": {"degree_0": {"PSNR": 28.482966870725463, "SSIM": 0.7997634244963788, "Score": [75.59187981322577, 145.53161029737694, 151.17270010421575]}, "DoLP": {"PSNR": 76.42642463001022, "SSIM": 0.9999715901972833, "Score": [75.59187981322577, 145.53161029737694, 151.17270010421575]}, "AoLP": {"PSNR": 80.93853635123924, "SSIM": 0.9999905933033336, "Score": [75.59187981322577, 145.53161029737694, 151.17270010421575]}}, "score": 91.86395993774192}
