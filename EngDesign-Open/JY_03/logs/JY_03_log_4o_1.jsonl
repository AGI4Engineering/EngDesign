The kernel will be used to estimate the missing values (zeros) in the checkerboard pattern of the Degree0 array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The Degree0 array is a 100x100 matrix with a checkerboard pattern of zeros. This means that every alternate pixel in both rows and columns is zero.\n   - We need to fill these zeros using a linear interpolation method.\n\n2. **Designing the Kernel:**\n   - A kernel is a small matrix used to perform operations like convolution on an image.\n   - For linear interpolation, we want to estimate the missing value (zero) based on its neighboring non-zero values.\n   - The kernel should have a center value of 1, which means the current pixel value is considered in the interpolation.\n   - A simple linear interpolation kernel can be designed as a 3x3 matrix:\n     \n     ```\n     [[0.25, 0.5, 0.25],\n      [0.5,  1,   0.5],\n      [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]]\n     ```\n   - This kernel gives more weight to the immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors (0.5) and less weight to the diagonal neighbors (0.25).\n\n3. **Applying the Kernel:**\n   - The kernel will be applied to each zero in the Degree0 array.\n   - For each zero, the kernel will be centered on the zero, and the surrounding non-zero values will be used to compute the interpolated value.\n   - The interpolated value is calculated as the weighted sum of the surrounding values, where the weights are defined by the kernel.\n\n4. **Testing with AoLP and DoLP:**\n   - After filling the Degree0 array, the AoLP (Angle of Linear Polarization) and DoLP (Degree of Linear Polarization) images can be computed.\n   - These images will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the kernel. A good kernel should result in AoLP and DoLP images that are smooth and consistent with the expected polarization patterns.\n\nBy following these steps, we can effectively fill the missing values in the Degree0 array and evaluate the kernel's performance using the AoLP and DoLP images.", config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.25, 0.5, 0.25], [0.5, 1.0, 0.5], [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'degree_0': {'PSNR': np.float64(23.69400650701499), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.714446096593812), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}, 'DoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(74.13881600756719), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999104436825622), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}, 'AoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(76.86743477949068), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999381998661628), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}}, 'score': np.float64(88.44660432115312)}
