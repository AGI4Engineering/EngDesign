{'completion_tokens': 2903, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Pattern analysis\n   • The given Degree0 frame shows a checker-board distribution: positions where (row + column) is even contain the real 0° measurements while positions where (row + column) is odd are 0 (missing samples).\n   • Each missing sample is therefore surrounded (up, down, left, right) by the four closest valid 0° pixels.  Using those four neighbours is the exact bilinear interpolation that the demosaicing stage of a polarization camera normally applies before AoLP / DoLP are computed.\n\n2. Kernel design requirements\n   • Centre coefficient must be 1 (requirement from the prompt).\n   • For a missing pixel, its own value is 0, so the centre term contributes nothing; the filled value should become the average of its four cardinal neighbours → place 0.25 on those neighbours (¼ + ¼ + ¼ + ¼ = 1).\n   • Diagonal positions do not participate in the bilinear average, therefore their weights are 0.\n\n3.

Impact on AoLP & DoLP\n   • This bilinear scheme preserves low-frequency content and avoids phase bias, leading to smoother Stokes vectors and therefore more stable AoLP/DoLP fields compared with nearest-neighbour or large Gaussian kernels.\n', config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.0, 0.25, 0.0], [0.25, 1.0, 0.25], [0.0, 0.25, 0.0]])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'degree_0': {'PSNR': np.float64(28.482966870725463), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.7997634244963788), 'Score': [np.float64(75.59187981322577), np.float64(145.53161029737694), np.float64(151.17270010421575)]}, 'DoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(76.42642463001022), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999715901972833), 'Score': [np.float64(75.59187981322577), np.float64(145.53161029737694), np.float64(151.17270010421575)]}, 'AoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(80.93853635123924), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999905933033336), 'Score': [np.float64(75.59187981322577), np.float64(145.53161029737694), np.float64(151.17270010421575)]}}, 'score': np.float64(91.86395993774192)}
