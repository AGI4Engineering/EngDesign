The kernel should be able to estimate the missing values (zeros) based on the surrounding non-zero values. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The Degree0 array is a 100x100 matrix with a checkerboard pattern of zeros. This means every alternate value in each row and column is zero.\n   - Our task is to fill these zeros using a kernel that performs linear interpolation.\n\n2. **Designing the Kernel:**\n   - A kernel is a small matrix used to apply a filter to an image. In this case, the kernel will be used to interpolate missing values.\n   - The kernel should have a center value of 1, which means the current pixel value is retained if it's non-zero.\n   - The surrounding values in the kernel should be designed to average the neighboring non-zero values to fill in the zero values.\n\n3. **Kernel Structure:**\n   - A simple 3x3 kernel can be used for this task. The kernel will look at the immediate neighbors of a zero value and compute an average to fill it.\n   - The kernel can be designed as follows:\n     ```\n     [[0.25, 0.5, 0.25],\n      [0.5,  1,   0.5],\n      [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]]\n     ```\n   - This kernel gives more weight to the direct horizontal and vertical neighbors (0.5) and less weight to the diagonal neighbors (0.25).\n\n4. **Application of the Kernel:**\n   - The kernel will be applied to each zero value in the Degree0 array. The non-zero values in the neighborhood will be used to compute the interpolated value.\n   - This process will be repeated for all zero values in the array.\n\n5. **Testing with AoLP and DoLP:**\n   - After filling the Degree0 array, the AoLP and DoLP images will be generated.\n   - These images will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the kernel. A good kernel should result in AoLP and DoLP images that are consistent and accurate.\n\nBy following these steps, we can effectively fill the missing values in the Degree0 array and ensure the quality of the resulting AoLP and DoLP images.", config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.25, 0.5, 0.25], [0.5, 1.0, 0.5], [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'degree_0': {'PSNR': np.float64(23.69400650701499), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.714446096593812), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}, 'DoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(74.13881600756719), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999104436825622), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}, 'AoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(76.86743477949068), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999381998661628), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}}, 'score': np.float64(88.44660432115312)}
