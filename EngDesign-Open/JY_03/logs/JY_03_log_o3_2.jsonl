{'completion_tokens': 865, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. Observation\n   The provided Degree0 frame exhibits a perfect 2×2 checker-board pattern: all samples that belong to the physical 0° micro-polariser sites are correct, whereas the complementary sites (coming from the 45°, 90° and 135° polarisers) appear as zeros.\n\n2. Goal\n   Reconstruct the missing (zero) elements through linear (bilinear) interpolation while keeping the original green-channel pixels unchanged.  A classical way is to convolve the image with a small symmetrical kernel that gives the highest weight to the nearest valid neighbours.\n\n3. Constraints for the kernel\n   • It must approximate bilinear interpolation (linear in x and y).\n   • The coefficient at the centre must be exactly 1 so that valid 0° pixels remain untouched during convolution.\n   • All other coefficients should be positive and smaller than 1.  Nearest cardinal neighbours (N,E,S,W) get the largest auxiliary weight, diagonals a smaller one.\n\n4. 3×3 bilinear-like kernel (un-normalised)\n   ┌                               ┐\n   │ 0.25   0.50   0.25 │\n   │ 0.50   1.00   0.50 │   ← centre = 1\n   │ 0.25   0.50   0.25 │\n   └                               ┘\n   Rationale: If we ignore the centre (because it is zero for the missing sites) the remaining weights sum to 3.0, producing the classical bilinear estimate   (N+S+E+W)/2 + (NE+NW+SE+SW)/4 .  After the convolution one can optionally renormalise by the sum of the contributing weights (those whose source pixel ≠0).\n\n5. Use with DoLP / AoLP\n   Once Degree0 is completed, the conventional DoLP = sqrt((I0-I90)^2+(I45-I135)^2) / (I0+I90) and AoLP = 0.5·atan2( I45-I135 , I0-I90 ) calculations will give meaningful values everywhere, so the quality of the kernel can be assessed indirectly by the smoothness and consistency of the DoLP/AoLP maps.\n\n6.
