{'completion_tokens': 1914, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning="To solve this problem, I need to design a kernel that performs linear interpolation to fill in the zero values in Degree0 while ensuring the center value of the kernel is 1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the pattern of zeros in Degree0:\n- Looking at the array, I can see it has a checkerboard pattern where every other element is 0.\n- This means each zero value is surrounded by non-zero values horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.\n\nWhen designing a kernel for interpolation, I need to consider:\n1. The center value must be 1 (as specified)\n2. The kernel should effectively interpolate from neighboring values\n3. The kernel should be symmetric to avoid directional bias\n\nFor linear interpolation in 2D, the simplest approach is to use the 4 adjacent values (top, right, bottom, left). Each of these neighbors would contribute equally to the interpolation, so we can assign them equal weights.\n\nIf the center value is 1, and we're interpolating from 4 neighbors, then each neighbor should have a weight that makes sense for interpolation. Since I'm replacing zeros with interpolated values, the center value of 1 would be for the existing non-zero values (to keep them unchanged), while the zero values would be replaced by a weighted average of their neighbors.\n\nA standard linear interpolation kernel would look like:\n0.0  0.25  0.0\n0.25  1.0  0.25\n0.0  0.25  0.0\n\nHowever, considering the checkerboard pattern, each zero has non-zero values diagonally as well. Including these diagonal neighbors in the interpolation might provide better results. In that case, a kernel like this would be appropriate:\n\n0.125  0.25  0.125\n0.25   1.0   0.25\n0.125  0.25  0.125\n\nThe sum of all the neighboring weights is 1.5, which means when applied to a zero value surrounded by non-zero values, the result will be a weighted average of those neighbors, with the weights properly normalized.\n\nThis kernel maintains the center value of 1 as required, and interpolates zeros using all 8 neighboring values, giving more weight to the direct neighbors (up, right, down, left) and less weight to the diagonal neighbors.", config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.125, 0.25, 0.125], [0.25, 1.0, 0.25], [0.125, 0.25, 0.125]])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'degree_0': {'PSNR': np.float64(17.51946632142249), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.4620410429205251), 'Score': [np.float64(45.001385047804376), np.float64(134.2765785269483), np.float64(133.06543436029074)]}, 'DoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(67.44170571844296), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9994889275778917), 'Score': [np.float64(45.001385047804376), np.float64(134.2765785269483), np.float64(133.06543436029074)]}, 'AoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(66.46818809867565), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9996039847389233), 'Score': [np.float64(45.001385047804376), np.float64(134.2765785269483), np.float64(133.06543436029074)]}}, 'score': 66.66666666666667}
