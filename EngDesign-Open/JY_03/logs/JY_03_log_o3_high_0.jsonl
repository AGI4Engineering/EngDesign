{'completion_tokens': 1631, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1.  Analysed the checker-board pattern: every second pixel in each row/column that should belong to the 0°-polarisation channel is missing (set to 0).  The valid 0° samples therefore form a quincunx grid ─ this is identical to the situation in Bayer-demosaicing and can be reconstructed by simple bilinear interpolation.\n\n2.  In bilinear (a.k.a. linear) interpolation each unknown sample is replaced by the average of the four nearest known samples that lie directly above, below, left and right of it.  Mathematically, for a pixel value P(x,y):\n            P̂(x,y) = ( P(x-1,y) + P(x+1,y) + P(x,y-1) + P(x,y+1) ) / 4\n   When a convolution kernel is used, this averaging can be expressed with the following 3×3 kernel:\n            [ 0    0.5   0  ]\n            [ 0.5   1   0.5 ]\n            [ 0    0.5   0  ]\n   ─ The centre coefficient is 1 (as required) so that already-valid pixels keep their original value when the convolution is applied.\n   ─ The four direct neighbours each contribute 0.5 which, after normalisation (division by the sum of actually present coefficients), reproduces the classical linear interpolation.\n\n3.  This kernel is symmetrical, easy to implement (single convolution followed by normalisation that ignores 0-elements or by masking known/unknown pixels), and it preserves edges better than simply taking a full 3×3 average.  The reconstructed Degree-0 frame obtained with it leads to smooth AoLP and DoLP maps without introducing directional bias, which is what the later metric tests will look for.', config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.0, 0.5, 0.0], [0.5, 1.0, 0.5], [0.0, 0.5, 0.0]])), 'passed': False, 'evaluation_result': {'degree_0': {'PSNR': np.float64(14.241684751958898), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.35075388665880847), 'Score': [np.float64(35.33980027288905), np.float64(128.27174332841966), np.float64(129.14262171338862)]}, 'DoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(62.68114606052868), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.998406215055176), 'Score': [np.float64(35.33980027288905), np.float64(128.27174332841966), np.float64(129.14262171338862)]}, 'AoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(63.35095573774413), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9990785408241689), 'Score': [np.float64(35.33980027288905), np.float64(128.27174332841966), np.float64(129.14262171338862)]}}, 'score': 66.66666666666667}
