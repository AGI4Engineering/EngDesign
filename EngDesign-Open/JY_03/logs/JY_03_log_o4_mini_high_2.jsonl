{'completion_tokens': 1788, 'response': Response_structure(reasoning='1. We observe that Degree0 contains a checkerboard pattern where every other pixel is zero. These “black” pixels need to be estimated from their nonzero neighbors via interpolation.\n\n2. A straightforward way is to treat the zero pixels as missing data and apply a small convolutional kernel that performs bilinear (i.e. linear in x and y) interpolation from the 8-surrounding neighbors.\n\n3. In 1-D bilinear interpolation one uses weights [1,2,1]/4 so that the center has weight 2/2=1. Extending to 2-D by the outer product of [1,2,1] with itself yields a 3×3 kernel whose center is (2·2)/(4)=1, and whose neighbors carry appropriately smaller weights.\n\n4. The resulting 3×3 kernel is:\n   [ [1/4, 1/2, 1/4],\n     [1/2,   1, 1/2],\n     [1/4, 1/2, 1/4] ]\n   which sums to 4, but retains center=1 exactly. Convolving this over the image fills zeros by linearly blending the surrounding known pixels.\n\n5. Applying this kernel to Degree0 will yield a smoothly interpolated image. We can then recompute AoLP and DoLP on the filled frames; their fidelity against ground truth will serve as the final metric of interpolation quality.', config=ConfigFile(Kernel=[[0.25, 0.5, 0.25], [0.5, 1.0, 0.5], [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]])), 'passed': True, 'evaluation_result': {'degree_0': {'PSNR': np.float64(23.69400650701499), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.714446096593812), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}, 'DoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(74.13881600756719), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999104436825622), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}, 'AoLP': {'PSNR': np.float64(76.86743477949068), 'SSIM': np.float64(0.9999381998661628), 'Score': [np.float64(65.33981296345934), np.float64(142.6690421935871), np.float64(146.0812034676715)]}}, 'score': np.float64(88.44660432115312)}
